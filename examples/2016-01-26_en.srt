1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,060
10

2
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,900
15

3
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,460
well

4
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,940
then

5
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,780
family

6
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,580
And muscle sig

7
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,680
euro

8
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,900
okay

9
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,840
all

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Good night

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Today we are very happy to invite researcher Wang Zhonghe

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's help us interpret a topic that has been very, very lively recently

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
How to deal with global warming was held in Paris about a month ago

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So today Dr. Wang can help us very well. How should we respond personally?

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
He will explain the data very clearly

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Dr. Wang's expertise is in stable isotropic geochemical analysis

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Dr. Wang is now a researcher at the Earth Institute

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He is also the director of the secretariat of our Academia Sinica

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
so he should be very busy

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,240
Come on one night and tell us about these things

21
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
Grateful

22
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,900
Well, his research field is actually very broad.

23
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,360
It has a lot to do with climate warming

24
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,740
There is still water temperature before the warming environment

25
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,500
I believe you often see him on TV too

26
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,900
Talk about the issue of water resources

27
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,940
The precursor of the earthquake and so on

28
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,400
This is all within the scope of his research

29
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:36,300
He graduated from campus university in 1984

30
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,300
I returned to Taiwan after getting my Ph.D.

31
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,300
just go back to Academia Sinica

32
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,300
So he is also in Academia Sinica

33
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,300
30 years

34
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,300
32 years

35
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,900
Well, not only is he here, except for the Academia Sinica

36
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,500
He is also in the National Taiwan University Center for Global Change

37
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,100
National Chengchi University General Studies Center

38
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,200
central university

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,200
Hydrology and marine science research units

40
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,500
part time

41
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,100
So what I read just now is related to his specialty.

42
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,900
So later if you are interested

43
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,900
Can

44
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,700
you can ask him well

45
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:24,700
The topic he gave us today is global warming and disaster prevention and response

46
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,400
So what we just said about this summit in Paris

47
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,000
to talk about global warming

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
How to deal with disasters has not been mentioned

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
OK, we welcome Dr. Wang

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,900
Thank you to the vice president, the secretary-general, Mr. Li, and all the distinguished guests.

51
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,000
Colleagues

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,600
It is my great honor to be present at our Knowledge Feast in January 2016 today

53
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,700
Let everyone be the first to report our climate warming

54
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,600
A trend we now call global warming

55
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,100
And the impact we will face under this trend

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
what we should have

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
First of all, let me review with you

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
our past year

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
2015

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
we all say 2015

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
it is our earth has history

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Since the temperature measurement

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
hottest year

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
this year

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
we just said

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We use five indicators to tell you

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
why is it so unique

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Its first uniqueness is

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
it was in 2015

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
everyone can see

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Here is February 2015

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The following is 14

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The next step is 13

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That is, it is February every year

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
everyone can see

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
most importantly

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
how much it rises every year

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
about two to three units

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Then in 2015 it has several characteristics

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
the first is

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It is the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Has broken through 400 units

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
For the first time in 3 million years

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
it not only says

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Breaking through 400 units this month

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
In fact, there are a total of 8 months in 2015

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Both broke through our 400 units

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is our past human history

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,720
not available in the market

91
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,000
We just saw February March

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,200
it's april

93
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,320
then may june

94
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,700
Then the next thing is

95
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,320
it's july november december

96
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,080
So you can see here a series of

97
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,680
all told us

98
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,080
8 months of the year break through

99
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,840
This carbon dioxide has exceeded 400 units

100
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,880
this is very unique

101
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,680
Then we are all a witness to history

102
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,600
This is the first anomaly indicator

103
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,320
The second indicator is just said

104
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,880
2015 is actually the year we started in 1850

105
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,680
A very accurate measure of the temperature dependence of the Earth's surface

106
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,800
It has the highest global temperature

107
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,960
As you can see, this is the year

108
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,160
from 1850

109
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,120
this is the temperature

110
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,520
temperature is the outlier

111
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,000
Its baseline is the average from 1961 to 1990

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,960
We can see that

113
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,400
It is probably the highest after this time

114
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,000
It's just that 2015 was the hottest year since Dominance

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,560
This is the second indicator

116
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,080
the third is

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
on the east side of our Pacific Ocean

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,400
There is also a sound phenomenon

119
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,160
The sound phenomenon is to the east of the Pacific Ocean

120
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,800
The temperature of sea water is very high

121
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
This time the sound phenomenon is caused by

122
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,000
Since 1950, we have actually been since the 20th century

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The strongest sound phenomenon we have ever observed

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,200
This time not only the temperature of our ocean is very hot

125
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,600
It affects all our atmospheres

126
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,800
and the interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean

127
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,200
also affects a climate on all of Earth's

128
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,600
This sound phenomenon so far

129
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,800
still in development

130
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,200
It will make our climate this year come

131
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,600
Will bring some variables that we can't imagine

132
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,200
Below you see the green

133
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,400
Blue is anti-sound phenomenon

134
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,600
Then this time after the sound ends

135
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,600
We'll be ready for the next backlash

136
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,000
This is the third indicator

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,400
The fourth indicator we just got from the atmosphere

138
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,000
then into the ocean

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,400
it's still ocean

140
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,000
The fourth indicator is the global sea level

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Global sea level since 1993 we started

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,720
MSI is a very accurate measure of the average height of sea level on our planet's surface

143
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,320
We can see from 1993 to October 16, 2015

144
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,480
that's the last bit

145
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,680
then throw up

146
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,560
Our sea levels have risen by more than 8 centimeters

147
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,560
in such a short time

148
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,280
Over 20 years, our sea level will increase by 8 cm

149
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,160
Probably the entire past twentieth century

150
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,040
double in a century

151
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,320
so this is a very high number

152
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,640
But everyone can see

153
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,760
The last curve is still accelerating

154
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,120
it means

155
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,200
In the future, the sea level will continue to rise

156
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,960
and it will be faster

157
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,640
This is the fourth very unusual indicator we see

158
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,960
The fifth is actually very far away from us

159
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,080
This is the origin of this Arctic Oscillation

160
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,600
is our arctic ocean

161
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,680
The Arctic Ocean in March last year

162
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,000
Here's an indicator of what we saw in mid-March last year

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,040
Its ice cap area is the white part

164
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,200
Only 14 million square kilometers

165
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,120
This is us from 1979

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The lowest record since the start of measurement

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
In 1979 we measured here

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We can see it slowly slide all the way down

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
it's winter

170
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Winter is the largest location of Arctic Sun

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
There are more than 1000 square kilometers

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But March 2015 was the lowest since Dominance

173
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
only 14 million

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
In the past you can see more than 16 million

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Such a phenomenon is expressed by saying that

176
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
When its winter ice cover becomes smaller

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
its summer will be more serious

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I will use the data to make a report with you

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
These five indicators all tell us that

180
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
2015 was a very unique year

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
this unique year

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
From our atmosphere to our oceans

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
to this far edge of ours

184
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
all told us

185
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The earth has happened a lot and there is no way

186
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Things I didn't see before

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
these things can happen

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Mainly because we changed

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Some important factors in our earth

190
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
One factor is the greenhouse gases in our large estates

191
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
we can use carbon dioxide

192
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Its concentration is an indicator

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Mainly look at

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,440
This is our earth's distant past

195
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,920
Our present is at the last point

196
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,360
We look at the past 100,000 years

197
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,040
two hundred thousand years

198
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,640
three hundred thousand years

199
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,520
four hundred thousand years

200
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,440
The concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere

201
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
it rises and falls naturally

202
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,960
it will be high

203
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,440
it will be low

204
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:14,920
it will be more

205
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,600
it will be less

206
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,440
It's like the coat of our earth

207
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,440
but it's more

208
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,640
it also has an upper limit

209
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,040
The upper limit is about 300 units

210
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,360
it's the lowest

211
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,240
about 180

212
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,520
That is to say, they differ from each other

213
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,320
About 100 units

214
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
As long as the 100 units change

215
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,720
the climate of our planet

216
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,560
From Warm Ages to Ice Ages

217
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,800
Or from the ice age and back to the warm period

218
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,440
So only need to change 100 units

219
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,680
The climate of our planet will be completely changed

220
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,080
But now our human influence

221
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,360
It's the blue line at the back

222
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,080
This line we amplify it

223
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,160
This is the line you see above

224
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,120
We've been real since 1958

225
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,880
The CO2 concentration in the air has been so low until now

226
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,240
when we only see one thing

227
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,800
It's in our atmosphere

228
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,040
us

229
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The concentration of breathed carbon dioxide is constantly increasing

230
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
to this year's

231
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Either this year or last July

232
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Has broken through 400 units

233
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It is also the highest ever

234
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The annual average for 2015

235
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It will also break through 400 units

236
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But it keeps going up

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You can see the one we just released

238
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This indicator for each month

239
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
its annual growth rate

240
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It is a big increase of 2 to 3 units compared with last year

241
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
According to a rate like this

242
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
if we don't make any changes

243
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
it will be before 2038

244
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
will break through a very important critical point

245
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
called 450 units

246
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Once the 450 orders break through,

247
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Our planet will bring unimaginable results

248
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Our temperature will rise very fast

249
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The change we face

250
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's all beyond our imagination

251
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So we human beings in such a

252
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Under the circumstances we made two mistakes

253
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The first mistake is

254
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We broke a natural ceiling

255
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And break through very fast

256
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
From 200 to 300 in the past

257
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
it only increases by 100 units

258
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Earth is from an ice banner

259
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You flipped all of a sudden to a very warm ice age

260
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
it only takes 100 units

261
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
We have now added another 100 units

262
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You can see us from 300 before the industrial revolution

263
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
278 We've reached 400 units now

264
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So we added 100 units in a very short time

265
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So we're not only breaking a natural upper limit

266
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And we increase the number rate 100 times that of nature

267
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We used to go from 200 to 300 and it took us 20,000 years

268
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It takes 20,000 years to naturally increase

269
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Now we only spent 200+ years

270
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So we use the data rate of nature at a very fast speed in the slave

271
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This disturbs the ecosystem of our entire planet.

272
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That is what we are facing today

273
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Some changes we haven't seen, thought, or heard of in the past

274
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
In this picture, it tells us that

275
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The mistakes we made were very, very horrific

276
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
also very stupid

277
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The left is a natural state

278
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
this is our earth

279
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
we have a very important atmosphere

280
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It has very precise concentrations of greenhouse gases

281
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The CO2 is one of the guards with this

282
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Oxygen Nitric Oxide, the first pill, is measured with a concentration of one part per billion

283
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
In the past, its changes were very limited.

284
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And it goes up and down within a very limited range

285
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It holds the sun to our surface

286
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Heat energy can be intercepted at our surface

287
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
warm the earth

288
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
but not too hot

289
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Then it's going to decrease a little

290
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It emits a little more heat

291
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
our earth will be cold

292
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
but not too cold

293
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But now everything has changed

294
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
that's what we are now

295
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Because after two hundred years of influence

296
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Our pan-nitrogen oxide

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Pill A and Oxygen Nitric Oxide both increased significantly

298
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The rate of increase is very fast

299
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It is a hundred times that of nature in the past

300
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and it increases the amount

301
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
also surpassed our past

302
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
This undulating quality between ice cream and ice cream

303
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Now we hold the sun up to

304
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Our surface traps very, very much heat

305
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So the thermal energy temperature of our surface

306
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I watched it never go up

307
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Not only does it mean that the heat coming in from the outside cannot go out

308
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The endotype of the earth inside us is actually a temperature exceeding

309
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Humidity 6000 degrees

310
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It actually used to go through this long distance

311
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
From the cold in the sky to the crust

312
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and then radiate through the thick layer into our outer space

313
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
now it can't get out

314
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So now we actually have two incoming thermal energies

315
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
one is from outside

316
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
we keep it

317
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
One was supposed to go out from inside

318
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
can't go out now

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
stay on the surface of our crust

320
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So now our greenhouse gas

321
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The amount of heat accumulated on our surface is staggering

322
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
How amazing is it?

323
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Later we have the actual data

324
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
This is what we have on the surface of the Earth today

325
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
all the way to the sea and all the way to our land

326
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
what we observed

327
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
There are 10 indicators on this

328
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
In these 10 indicators

329
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
7 all told us that

330
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Our temperature is increasing

331
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
one is the temperature of the atmosphere

332
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
One is the humidity of the atmosphere

333
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
One is the sea surface temperature

334
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
sea ​​surface temperature

335
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
heat in the ocean

336
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Plus the temperature of our land is also increasing

337
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So we are now from air to sea to land

338
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that's even scarier

339
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Our sea level increases with temperature

340
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
it will expand

341
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And our mountain glaciers

342
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
melting all the time

343
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
it comes in

344
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
it flows into the waters of our ocean basins

345
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,400
always rising

346
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,000
So we just saw that there is a fourth indicator that is sea level

347
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
rising faster and faster

348
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,400
that helps us regulate the temperature

349
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,600
In addition to the high mountain and the two-level edge

350
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
and snow

351
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,800
and the beach inside

352
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,200
It is like our earth's natural freezer

353
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,400
But their numbers are decreasing

354
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,800
Their functions are also slowly shrinking

355
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,200
The impact on us will be more and more

356
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
So we look at these indicators

357
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,800
like what

358
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
like we did a physical today

359
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,400
We failed all the indicators

360
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,600
our snow duck

361
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,000
our snow hall

362
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
our cholesterol

363
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,400
We're failing every measure of our health

364
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,000
That's what we're facing on Earth today

365
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,200
This is the IPCC

366
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,000
It's the Intergovernmental Commission on Changing the Name of the Post-7th Generation

367
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,800
it was in 2013 to 2014

368
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,200
It released two pictures in the fifth post-Qi commentary report

369
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,600
we'll just put it here

370
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,400
tell everyone

371
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,200
Because we accumulated so much heat

372
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,000
Now we do scientific observations

373
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,400
we saw the unfortunate truth

374
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,000
That is, the temperature of our surface continues to rise

375
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
This is from 1850 until

376
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
it's 2012

377
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
From 1850 to 2012

378
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
we can see a fact

379
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
is the rate at which our entire planet's surface rises

380
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
probably once

381
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This is the first one

382
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
In the past, the earth would rise by one degree

383
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It drops by one degree, in fact, it will adjust itself

384
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
but it goes up one degree

385
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
it better take 5000+ years

386
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
We only spent 150 years now

387
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So we not only say

388
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
increase the amount of greenhouse gas accumulation very much

389
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Our woods are growing very fast

390
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
We've also seen our temperatures rise

391
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
also very amazing

392
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Even more terrifying is the picture below

393
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This picture is the temperature of 10 years

394
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
do an average

395
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
so you see a square

396
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
is the average temperature every 10 years

397
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
its black part

398
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It is the average value in the past 10 years

399
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
past we see

400
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Cubes with mean temperature per 10 years

401
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
it will all overlap

402
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It goes up and down very slowly

403
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But since 1980

404
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
We've seen the situation change completely.

405
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Since 1980

406
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
we can see the temperature

407
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Every 10 years is a bouncing rock

408
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
it will never again

409
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,600
Relatively together, they will not overlap

410
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,800
So what does this jumping up signify?

411
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,400
means that our temperature is not only rising

412
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
And the rise is accelerating

413
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,000
This is what we are facing now

414
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,600
So our temperature is still increasing

415
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Our rate of temperature increase is accelerating

416
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,800
This is what we observe now

417
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,200
Next, we are not only talking about our past

418
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,600
we can see our future too

419
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,600
This is what the IPCC stated in its Fifth Assessment Report

420
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
another picture

421
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,200
it allows us to see us now

422
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,800
our past and our future

423
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,000
Our past is what we just said

424
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
This is from 1950 to our present

425
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We see that the temperature keeps rising

426
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,400
So we in this generation

427
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,600
in the process of our growing up

428
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,800
We are all witnesses of history

429
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,600
We've all seen this temperature keep rising

430
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,200
But we look from now to the future

431
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,000
we only see one fact

432
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,900
No matter what kind of energy reduction and carbon reduction we adopt

433
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,200
or do this temperance work

434
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,400
Here, of course, the IPCC has made four different

435
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,000
This scenario simulates

436
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,800
What we want most is of course this

437
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,200
just please blue

438
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,760
Then there is a strong energy reduction and carbon reduction

439
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,860
It keeps our temperature going up

440
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,960
just be slow

441
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,460
But others, no matter whether it is low-medium or high-medium

442
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,960
don't even make any changes

443
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,760
It will be even more astonishing as our temperature rises

444
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,260
This picture only tells us one thing

445
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,660
We do any energy reduction and carbon reduction

446
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,260
well done we still have to go up

447
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,460
It's just that the rise is less and the rise is slower

448
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,660
we didn't do well

449
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,260
Our future temperature rise

450
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,020
it will be very very amazing

451
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,020
In other words, our future

452
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,020
at least before 2000

453
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,520
what we can't change

454
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
Can not be changed is the temperature will not rise

455
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,020
temperature will continue to rise

456
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,020
only through our efforts

457
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,020
will slow down the rate of rise

458
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,020
it hit us less

459
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,520
if we don't make any changes

460
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,020
Then the impact we bring will be very, very large.

461
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,520
Where are the shocks?

462
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
That's what I'm going to tell you

463
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,020
Speaking of which means we used to go

464
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,020
Because the temperature has risen by one degree like this

465
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,020
what we are facing

466
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
If we continue to rise in the future

467
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
at least once

468
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
or one and a half

469
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
or more than two

470
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Our increased exposure to shocks

471
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
probably far more than

472
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
our imagination today

473
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
This is when the IBCD was in 2014

474
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It reports a picture inside

475
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
This picture is very important

476
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
where does it matter

477
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What we just showed you is an indicator of temperature.

478
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It is an indicator of thermal energy

479
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Its heat energy unit is amazing

480
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
One unit is the 10-21 power glue ear

481
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
how big is this

482
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I will show you an indicator

483
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
In 2011, a

484
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
A Great Earthquake Off the Northeast Sea

485
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
long-standing

486
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It was the strongest earthquake of its kind ever recorded in Japan

487
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Bring to our earth and Japan

488
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
very serious injury

489
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The energy released by the earthquake

490
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
About 10-18 power glue ear

491
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So such a unit is 1000 times its

492
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
so you can know say

493
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
This is a very amazing surface energy

494
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We are now from 1970

495
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
There is a more accurate measurement of this

496
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,880
We express the result of our cool color in terms of heat energy

497
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,640
we see a result

498
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,680
From 1970 until now

499
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,400
The amount of heat we accumulate on the surface is actually very, very amazing

500
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,160
Where are these heats born?

501
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,920
born in our ocean

502
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,000
So the light blue you see

503
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,400
It is our shallow city sea water

504
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,120
The deep blue is the sea water of Shencheng

505
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,200
This accounts for about 90%

506
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,800
Next are the ice cities of the mountains and the polar glaciers

507
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,040
about 5%

508
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,760
What's left is the crust

509
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,840
none of us thought to say

510
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,080
Inside the land we walk every day

511
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,120
In fact, about 5% of the heat energy is hidden

512
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,360
is brown

513
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,760
The last dark purple is our atmospheric depth

514
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,040
Actually very few

515
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,320
less than 1%

516
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,720
But it's us today

517
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,240
Seeing changes in our weather

518
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,920
Next, I will tell you from a Kone face like this

519
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,840
we've been through so many years

520
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,560
We have accumulated so much heat energy on the surface of the earth

521
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,000
now hiding in our atmosphere

522
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,560
our oceans our crust

523
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,280
What kind of impact

524
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,600
This starts from the base

525
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,400
What we see is this little

526
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,720
very thin this one

527
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,280
But it changed us

528
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,920
In fact, we are every day today

529
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,960
every year we experience

530
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,880
Partyization in the grassroots

531
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,480
In terms of the heat energy it accumulates

532
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,880
We only see two very obvious results

533
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,720
the first is

534
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,600
everyone can see

535
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,960
from the past hundred years

536
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,480
The temperature of our Earth's surface has been rising

537
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,360
so we can all see our

538
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,960
The temperature of the earth's surface is constantly rising

539
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,480
the second

540
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,040
Our seasons can only change

541
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,320
And it changes in the direction of high temperature

542
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
This picture tells us that

543
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,840
This is one of our climate simulation models

544
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,160
This model is actually very simple

545
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,880
it tells us

546
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,840
Changes in our planet's surface temperature

547
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,280
actually very interesting

548
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,880
like a standard medium curve

549
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,400
The following is the representative temperature distribution

550
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,440
low temperature four temperature and high temperature

551
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,120
Generally in medium curve

552
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,360
when the normal distribution

553
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,880
The lower part will be less

554
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,800
There are not many high temperature parts

555
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,300
mostly room temperature

556
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,000
it represents our region

557
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,400
represent the length of our seasons

558
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,000
So for most organisms on Earth

559
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,700
We should all be at room temperature

560
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,500
But when the thermal energy of our surface increases

561
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,100
This center of gravity curve will shift

562
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,800
it is moving to the right

563
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,100
when moving to the right

564
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,500
You can see that there are two very obvious results

565
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,300
first it moves this way

566
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,200
The low temperature part becomes less and less

567
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,900
It turns out that in this dark blue so-called low-temperature part

568
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,000
There are so many words we put it into points

569
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,900
Now there is only a little bit left

570
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,800
on the other hand

571
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,500
The high temperature part is getting more and more scary

572
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
The high temperature part in the past is

573
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,400
Let's integrate it to get the yellow piece

574
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
Now it has become such a big piece

575
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,300
In more serious cases, the red part appears

576
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,600
this is not in the past

577
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,500
The red part we call record breaking heat

578
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,200
So bring three results

579
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,400
The first is that cold waves are getting less and less

580
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,900
Although we just passed a

581
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,500
The so-called overlord level cold current

582
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,100
But this is really going to be less and less in the future

583
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,400
But there will be more and more hot wolves in summer

584
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,000
And we're going to see record-breaking heat just keep coming

585
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,600
That's what we're seeing seasonally

586
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,000
Our ten years are changing rapidly

587
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,600
This is what is happening in Taiwan right now

588
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,000
The Japanese came to Taiwan from 1897

589
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Start helping us set up seven observatories

590
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,200
We have an accurate record of surface observations

591
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,800
we can see clearly

592
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,000
From 1897 until last year 2015

593
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,400
Our annual average temperature in Taiwan

594
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,000
just like the whole world

595
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,600
just keeps going up

596
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,800
In the process of rising

597
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,600
We also see that our seasons are changing

598
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,600
The most obvious is summer

599
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,800
Let's use the average temperature in July as a representative

600
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,600
You can see this from 1897 to the present

601
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,000
The one in the middle is 1950

602
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,800
this time in 1950

603
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,800
The temperature in Taiwan's summer has turned over in an instant

604
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,800
From cool summer to very hot and hot

605
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,320
Then we saw another change

606
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,440
is our winter

607
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,840
This winter happened in 1980

608
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,200
Just now you saw the temperature of our entire surface

609
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,040
This average temperature every 10 years begins to change like a jumping pill

610
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,680
We can see the temperature of this winter in Taiwan

611
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,400
We use January as a representative word

612
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,680
It's a drug-like change

613
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,080
In the past, our winter temperature will be very cold

614
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,080
like this time we say our temperature is low

615
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,080
It's like the temperature we saw in 1963

616
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,920
In fact, it has been difficult to appear after 1980

617
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,280
Temperatures like this in the past not only often appeared

618
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,800
and the time will be very long

619
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,760
But now we're only two or three days away

620
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,520
And it will be less and less

621
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,000
We have really entered a warm winter

622
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,960
Here you can see a few very unique

623
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,520
It is about 10,000 to 5,000 years in the past

624
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,960
Our earth will naturally increase by 1 degree

625
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,840
We are now more than 100 years old and have surpassed

626
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,920
In Taiwan

627
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,600
Our average temperature is about 1.4 degrees warmer

628
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Our 1998 was the warmest day in Taiwan in the past 100 years

629
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
But we'll be there soon

630
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So the past few years

631
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
we'll see a year that breaks through 1998

632
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Our past hottest summers were 2007 and 2014 were the hottest

633
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But in the future we still have new breakthroughs

634
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
so our seasons are changing

635
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
To change the distribution of average temperatures we can use for the 12 months of the year

636
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Let me give you an example

637
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's 12 months in a year

638
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
When the Japanese first came to Taiwan

639
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Our 12-month seasonal distribution looks like this

640
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
That is, January is not the hottest month in July.

641
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Then slowly come down and go back to 12 months

642
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
We usually use the average monthly temperature of 20 degrees as a threshold

643
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
We call it winter when it is lower than 20 degrees

644
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Anything higher than 25 degrees is called summer

645
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So judging from this indicator

646
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You can see the past 12 months

647
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
January, February and March are all winter

648
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
then this is our spring

649
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
this is our fall

650
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
this is our summer

651
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
summer is six seven eight nine

652
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,600
This line is the 10-year average from 2006 to 2015

653
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,200
rising every month

654
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,100
You put this increase rate every month

655
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,500
average it out

656
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,200
It's about our annual average temperature of 1.4 degrees.

657
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,700
but you can see clearly

658
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,400
It's still our winter

659
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,700
only december january february march

660
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,300
Already starting to get into this not-winter range

661
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,600
But our summer is long

662
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,900
Then our summer temperature also increases very fast

663
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,200
this is our present

664
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,200
If we follow what the IPCC told us just now

665
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,000
The temperature ahead of us will continue to increase

666
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,700
According to our current estimate

667
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,000
We are in the next less than 90 years

668
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,100
Our temperature in Taiwan will of course increase

669
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,000
3 degrees the change we bring will be more serious

670
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,100
the change of season

671
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,900
Let's use Taipei City as an example

672
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,200
I can tell you why it is not cold in winter

673
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
How our summers are getting hotter

674
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
not cold in winter

675
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,700
The cold measurement of our temperature in Taipei City is very accurate

676
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,100
Each hour has an observation

677
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,500
we were in 1976

678
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Before 1976 to see

679
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
The temperature is less than ten degrees of the facility

680
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
like this time

681
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Our temperature in the facility is ten degrees less than the facility

682
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
almost fully conductive

683
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
we call cold snap

684
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You see this pair of weather bureaus

685
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It must have had a continental cold air mass to clean it

686
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
about thirteen degrees

687
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Strong Continental Cold Air Mass

688
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
About eleven degrees, twelve degrees

689
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
This is called a strong continental cold air mass

690
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Ten degrees less than the facility

691
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
we call it cold

692
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
by cold standards

693
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It can be less than the total hours of ten degrees of the facility in a year

694
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Before 1976

695
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
There are 167 hours in a year

696
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
has now slowly declined

697
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
not slowly falling

698
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
very fast descent

699
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
From 167 to 2000

700
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Between 1976 and 55 remaining

701
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Now only 37 are left

702
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
How many hours do we have in 2015

703
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
is ten degrees less than the facility

704
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Many people are hard to guess

705
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
One hour

706
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
This year has certainly broken through

707
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
But it won't exceed this number

708
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
so you can know say

709
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Our winter is really getting colder

710
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
According to this estimate

711
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We are around 2030

712
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
before we can see

713
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It may be 10 degrees in the regional facilities

714
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
But on the other hand, we look at the high temperature

715
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
For high temperature, we say that the daily average temperature will be 30 degrees higher than that of the facility

716
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
If the average temperature of your day is 30 degrees

717
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's very hot at noon

718
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
about 35 degrees

719
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
For such a number of days

720
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Before 1976, Taipei City probably had less than 12 days a year

721
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
That's an average of 11 days

722
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Later increased to one month

723
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
it's a month and a half now

724
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
How many days have we passed in 2015?

725
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
67 days

726
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
so you can see it's really increasing

727
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
predicting the end of the century

728
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
We have 90 consecutive days

729
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It's very, very hot

730
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
We are not talking about continuous

731
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
We are able to continue as in 2015

732
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
only about 15 days

733
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
90 days in a row

734
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So this high temperature is for us

735
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
is a very serious threat

736
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
We use a 12-month average distribution like this

737
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
you can take a look

738
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Our current picture is what you can see

739
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
red line

740
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
this is what we have

741
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
we still have a little bit of winter

742
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,420
Then a short spring and autumn

743
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,620
long summer

744
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,000
But in the future, if the temperature is like this

745
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
we assume

746
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,500
Taiwan's monthly temperatures

747
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,000
It will rise by about three degrees this century

748
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
it's conservative

749
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
That is to say, the world is rising

750
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
double that of the past century

751
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Our Taiwan was originally 1.4 degrees

752
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
We estimate about three degrees

753
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
For example, call it two

754
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You can see the temperature of each month

755
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Its distribution is roughly like this

756
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
must be linear

757
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But the result it brings is

758
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
First we don't have winter anymore

759
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Because the threshold of winter is here

760
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
the coldest

761
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
January with the coldest temperature

762
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It's all over 20 degrees

763
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
but look at our summer

764
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
it's very very amazing

765
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
We probably have almost eight or nine months of summer

766
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
so there will be no winter vacation

767
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
no winter

768
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
We only have three months of heat vacation

769
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
not only students

770
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
all people have to let go

771
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Because in this three-month period

772
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
it's hard for us to go to work

773
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
we only have night time

774
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Only then can we go out and do some activities secretly

775
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
this is our atmosphere

776
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It changes the environment of our entire surface

777
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
it changes our seasons

778
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Next we look at another

779
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
We except the atmosphere

780
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Now the heat energy increases the most is actually in our oceans

781
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
This ocean it takes us the surface of the earth

782
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
The people we have accumulated over the past hundred years

783
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
it sucks it all in

784
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
and sucked in a lot

785
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It's actually a buffer

786
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
it is a regulator

787
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It helps so much heat energy accumulated on our planet

788
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
sucked it all in

789
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
From Shallow City to Deep City

790
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Shencheng is the sea water below 700 meters

791
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
very huge

792
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
it absorbs so much heat energy

793
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
In fact, its physical, chemical and biological properties

794
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
everything is changing

795
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
even more frightening

796
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere is very strong

797
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
they are like two angry people

798
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Bad tempered people are the same

799
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
So the interaction between them

800
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
become difficult for us to imagine in the past

801
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
we are more terrible

802
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
When the temperature of the ocean and atmosphere increases

803
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
we saw a terrible phenomenon

804
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Nice words are now very, very strong

805
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,640
If there is this on January 9th

806
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,800
I saw that many people came to listen to the speech of Academician Liu Shaozheng.

807
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,960
He told us that under climate warming

808
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,520
Taiwan's rainfall intensity has increased very, very alarmingly

809
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,560
this is what we are facing now

810
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,320
Another typhoon has actually surpassed our past imagination

811
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,360
this is what we are going through now

812
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,720
That's what we actually tested

813
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,880
This is from 1958 until now

814
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,200
We can see the amount of heat and cold above our cool gauge world

815
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,760
This unit is scarier

816
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,240
It is a 10.22 cm release gel

817
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,840
It only tells us that red represents sea water at a depth of 2000 meters

818
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,520
Black represents the deep sea water from 700 to 2000 meters

819
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,280
So whether it is above the whole boiling water

820
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,440
or deep sea water

821
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,440
We only see one and its accumulated heat energy is very, very high

822
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,560
The whole thing is two kilometers deep

823
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,080
It's hard for us to imagine in the past

824
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,360
in such a short time

825
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,680
Its temperature thermal energy increases so much

826
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,760
If we look at the distribution on the surface of the earth

827
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,040
The red part is from 1959 to 2008

828
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,560
How much heat energy we have accumulated during this time

829
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,920
The redder it is, the higher the accumulated heat energy will be in terms of temperature indicators

830
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,320
Then look at our Taiwan

831
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,840
Our Taiwan is in a range where heat energy accumulation is very high

832
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,240
Whether it's our east, west, south or north

833
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,040
The accumulation of heat energy is really very amazing

834
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,000
This is what our oceans are going through right now

835
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,480
The ones that can really cool down are of course very limited.

836
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,640
The temperature changed by the accumulated heat energy of our ocean is very, very obvious

837
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,360
This obviously has a very dire result in the rain

838
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,680
Why are we getting so much rain now?

839
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,960
because we changed the oceans and atmosphere

840
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,320
its thermal energy and its temperature

841
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,440
this is our past

842
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,160
The temperature of our oceans in the past was low

843
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,800
The temperature inside our atmosphere is cool

844
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
ocean temperature is low

845
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,440
So its ability to evaporate and shake off water vapor is actually very limited.

846
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,080
The temperature of our atmosphere is not high

847
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,040
The temperature is not high, the water vapor it can contain is also very limited

848
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,200
So at that time our rainfall patterns were all moderate

849
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,880
But now everything has changed

850
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,840
this is us now

851
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,120
brought

852
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,600
The temperature of our oceans has been accumulating

853
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,840
The thermal energy of its surface is constantly rising

854
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,760
it's been a steady stream

855
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,600
Send water vapor from the surface of the sea all the way to us

856
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,000
Then our big part is inside because of the temperature increase

857
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,800
We just said that over the last 150 years

858
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,800
The surface temperature of the atmosphere has increased by one degree

859
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,800
This one-degree increase would put the inside of our atmosphere

860
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,400
how much water vapor will increase

861
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,600
If we listened to Academician Liu Shaocheng last time

862
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,200
He told us that the increase in water vapor is about 7%.

863
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,400
This is when we presumably do climate research science

864
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
We probably generally accept the number

865
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,800
The evaporation of this 7% water vapor

866
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
now in our air

867
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,400
if so much

868
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,800
How much water does it have?

869
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,200
Let's use a unit as a metaphor for everyone

870
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,800
This is the Three Gorges Dam

871
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,400
The Three Gorges Dam is the largest dam on the surface of our planet

872
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,200
artificial dam

873
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,400
Its appearance is about 40 billion tons

874
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,000
40 billion tons is the total water consumption of Taiwan in two years

875
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,400
very amazing

876
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
it has so much water if it fills it up

877
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
so much water

878
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,280
but we are in the atmosphere

879
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,640
because of the increased

880
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,640
We increased the amount of water vapor by 7%

881
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,600
How many three dams are there?

882
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,280
It's hard for many people to imagine

883
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,880
its more than twenty thousand

884
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,000
So now there's so much water vapor

885
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,080
They are all flowing around in our Daji City

886
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,640
it just needs to have the right cover

887
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,720
suitable environment

888
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,840
it will use the way of super heavy rain

889
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,880
fell to our surface

890
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,360
So we can all see now

891
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,240
our surface

892
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,640
And of course the ocean

893
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,720
But the surface has the greatest impact on us humans

894
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,560
The intensity of rainfall is increasing rapidly

895
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,520
This is a result of our observation

896
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,400
this was last september

897
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,840
This is a photo from the Associated Press on September 10

898
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,320
This is when Typhoon Ai Tao is on the 9th

899
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,000
This is the week of September 9th in Japan

900
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,200
This is in the place of Ikeyama in Kinugawa

901
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,000
This flood situation

902
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,560
This torrential rain is Japan's past

903
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,200
A heavy rain that has never been experienced before

904
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,840
you can see these residents

905
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,480
are on its second floor

906
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,880
waiting for this

907
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
go rescue them

908
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Why are they in heavy rain

909
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
haven't escaped yet

910
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
because they don't even think

911
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
The amount of rain this time will be so strong

912
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And then inflict such a serious injury on them

913
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
this is us today

914
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
every country

915
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
every environment

916
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
what happens to us all

917
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
the heavy rain we had today

918
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
its intensity

919
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
the shock it brings

920
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
None of our past experience

921
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
conceivable

922
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Japan is so advanced in disaster prevention

923
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
so careful country

924
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
will encounter this situation

925
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
the other places are the same

926
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
all the same

927
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Our Taiwan is like this

928
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Exactly from 1901 until last year

929
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
We saw

930
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Taiwan's temperature and rainfall

931
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
A situation in which it interacts with each other

932
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
The red one is our temperature

933
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
temperature we can see

934
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
it's a long record

935
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So it is a five-year Huadong average

936
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
what it sees is

937
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Our temperature is the same as the whole world

938
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
it goes up and down

939
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
but it keeps going up

940
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It's just that it's fun

941
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
rise it will be leveled

942
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
If it rises again, it will be leveled again

943
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
This flattening is the ocean

944
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,440
Conditioning helps us buffer the consequences of

945
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,640
But rising and leveling

946
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,160
In the process of rising and leveling

947
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,600
We see that the relationship between temperature and rainfall

948
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,760
it has a wonderful relationship

949
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,080
blue is rain

950
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,360
before this warming

951
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,840
before 1950

952
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,480
We see the rainfall in Taiwan

953
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,640
It's the blue line

954
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,960
It is parallel to the temperature

955
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,160
temperature rises slowly

956
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,720
Rainfall is also increasing

957
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,440
Its ups and downs are actually very gentle

958
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,240
The impact it brings is actually very limited.

959
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,200
It does very little harm to us

960
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,400
But once sold out of 1950

961
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,200
everything has changed

962
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,320
we just saw that

963
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,200
seasons in taiwan

964
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,680
The first thing to change is summer

965
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,600
Summer has changed since 1950

966
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,720
Why did 1950 change

967
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,440
since the 1950s

968
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,760
average temperature around the world

969
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,840
For the first time surpassed our Medieval Nuki's online

970
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,520
So it brings up is a

971
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,040
very terrible change

972
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,160
Rainfall in Taiwan

973
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,200
all at once from an amble

974
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,200
becomes a

975
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,840
A completely different shape from the past

976
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,960
We call it like a roller coaster

977
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,080
From peak to first strand

978
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,240
From the peak to the trough

979
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,720
keeps happening repeatedly

980
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,720
every trough

981
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,720
That's where you see the green sword head

982
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,080
That is, our rainfall is relatively low

983
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,000
That is, when there is a drought in Taiwan

984
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
The first drought occurred in the mid-1960s

985
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,920
We gave birth to the so-called Shimen Reservoir

986
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,400
The second drought was around the 1980s

987
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,080
Our Bandit Water Reservoir has been flushed out

988
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,160
and then the third time

989
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,040
For the fourth time we are now just passing a fifth time

990
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,640
but go back right away

991
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,360
so our drought will recur

992
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,080
It's just that the time is getting shorter

993
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,680
faster and faster

994
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,720
used to be like this

995
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,920
15 years between the first and the second

996
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,280
Only 10 years left from the second to the third

997
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,800
Now we happen once in less than 10 years

998
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,480
on the other hand

999
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,840
The intensity of our torrential rain

1000
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,440
is what you see above

1001
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,880
It is the location with more rainfall

1002
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,960
has been rising

1003
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,160
especially after 1980

1004
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,880
when its temperature rises rapidly

1005
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,280
The intensity of our rainfall is suddenly

1006
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,600
bouncing growth

1007
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,840
especially after 1990

1008
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,200
We see the rainfall in our Taiwan

1009
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,120
completely different from the past

1010
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,080
in the past

1011
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,640
This has been the case for a hundred years

1012
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,080
just tell us one thing

1013
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,200
That is, the higher the temperature in Taiwan

1014
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,880
The intensity of our rainfall is really increasing

1015
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,280
Because we will have more and more water and gas sinks

1016
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
It's hurting us more and more

1017
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,280
But what I want to remind is this part

1018
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,840
Our temperature is now rising rapidly

1019
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,280
Our 2015 is already the first ever

1020
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,880
hottest year on earth

1021
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,080
but it's still growing

1022
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,280
So we expect to be entering

1023
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,080
The next wave of this upswing

1024
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,280
during this rising period

1025
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,360
We also expect this rainfall intensity in our future

1026
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,860
will further improve

1027
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,560
It's just that we really can't simulate

1028
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,560
no way to imagine

1029
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,160
There is no way to get accurate

1030
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:36,660
why

1031
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,360
Because we didn't have such a record in the past

1032
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,560
Our boundary condition

1033
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,760
There is no way for us to have a very accurate

1034
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,560
But we can learn from the past

1035
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,360
this extremeness of rainfall

1036
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,860
you can probably imagine

1037
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,460
The impact we face

1038
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,160
This is after Typhoon Heber in 1996

1039
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,280
We put every time this big typhoon

1040
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,560
the torrential rain it brings

1041
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,240
its rainfall intensity

1042
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,840
We take this 1996

1043
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,600
If the average value at that time is used as a benchmark

1044
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
It also affects the area of ​​our Taiwan

1045
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,900
This area is a percentage

1046
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,900
So this is 20% 40% 60%

1047
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,100
This is 50%

1048
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,400
That is half of Taiwan

1049
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,200
we see one thing

1050
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,700
Now it's not just a typhoon

1051
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,400
It's the blue dot

1052
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,000
Or the plum rain is the red square

1053
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,900
Its rainfall intensity is increasing rapidly

1054
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,900
Just like everyone sees this direction

1055
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,800
it has been increasing very fast

1056
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,200
especially after 2000

1057
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,700
Several typhoons we saw

1058
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:34,500
like nali in our taipei in 2001

1059
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,900
2008 New Lux in Clear Central

1060
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,900
Morakot in southern Taiwan in 2009

1061
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,600
and Sura 2012 affecting our whole north

1062
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,300
It's something we haven't seen before

1063
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,500
the intensity of its rainfall

1064
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,800
the area of ​​damage it causes

1065
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
It's all beyond our imagination

1066
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,000
But as our surface temperature accumulates,

1067
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,700
We also expect that it will continue to grow

1068
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,000
In the case of Morakot

1069
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,040
When the past happened in 2009

1070
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,720
it's on october 8 october 9 october 10

1071
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,920
three days

1072
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,840
In Alishan, the annual rainfall

1073
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,040
Take it all down

1074
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,480
It takes three days a year to bring it down

1075
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,440
we don't have a flood defense system

1076
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,320
Our row of red silk can withstand

1077
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,840
But we won't stop here

1078
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,480
We will definitely see a typhoon in the future

1079
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,840
It will take our year's rainfall

1080
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,960
It took about two days or one day to bring it down.

1081
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,080
no matter where

1082
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,800
it's hard for us to bear

1083
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,680
it's raining

1084
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,000
Next, let me tell you about the typhoon

1085
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,800
In 2015, we actually had a lot of typhoons

1086
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,680
We average about 25 to 26 a year

1087
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,360
27 in 2015

1088
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,040
2014 is of course okay

1089
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,520
2014 was relatively average

1090
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,400
31 in 2013

1091
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,560
no matter what

1092
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,680
When the temperature of sea water is getting higher and higher

1093
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,360
It is conducive to the formation of typhoons

1094
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,080
because of the typhoon

1095
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,960
It has a fundamental constraint

1096
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,760
The temperature of the sea water must be set above 28 degrees

1097
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,160
But now we set it above 28 degrees

1098
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,280
The Influence of Southernization of Octave English

1099
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Its scope of influence is very wide

1100
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,640
and from every month

1101
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,320
Every year from January to December

1102
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,280
like 2015

1103
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,280
Typhoons can form every month

1104
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,200
this typhoon

1105
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,960
Take 2015 as an example

1106
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,360
it tells us

1107
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,760
what might die in our future

1108
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,080
the first number

1109
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,120
Of course, 27 is a lot.

1110
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,200
The second one is widely distributed

1111
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,520
You can see this is the southern sea of ​​Japan

1112
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,760
some typhoons form

1113
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,200
just to the south of it

1114
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,920
A place higher than our Taiwan

1115
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,080
represents the temperature of seawater

1116
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,600
This place is already reachable

1117
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,480
It is the threshold of the Shenzhen typhoon

1118
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,600
And its strength can be very high

1119
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,280
2015 was good for the Western Pacific

1120
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,600
But for the Eastern Pacific

1121
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,680
is a very good example

1122
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,480
This is us from 2015

1123
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,160
compared with past averages

1124
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,520
Brown is average

1125
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,960
Typhoons that should come every month

1126
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,640
2015 is gray

1127
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,240
You can see that each month has

1128
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,640
Except for two months that are relatively low

1129
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,880
These two months are relatively low

1130
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,120
Every other month exceeds past average sub

1131
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,560
This is one that tells us

1132
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,060
The typhoon is really different from the past

1133
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,200
There is another one because of this warm

1134
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,060
You can see that this is the distribution of sea temperature around the world

1135
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,060
The redder the color, the higher its temperature

1136
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,560
We can see that this is on August 24th

1137
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,060
From this observation from the satellite

1138
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,440
It can be seen that there are seven at the same time

1139
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,160
The seventh can be formed in both the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean

1140
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,060
In the past we can see two

1141
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,060
can see three

1142
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,060
It's not easy to see four

1143
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,060
But this time we can see seven

1144
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,060
what does this mean

1145
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,060
represents the warming of our oceans now

1146
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:40,060
The conditions for forming our typhoon have changed

1147
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,060
not only change

1148
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,060
It also brings some challenges that we could not have imagined in the past

1149
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,060
For example, on October 23 last year

1150
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,060
In this America is the east side of the Pacific Ocean

1151
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,060
There's a typhoon near this place in Mexico

1152
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,060
Called Patricksonia

1153
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:57,060
as it approaches mexico on october 23

1154
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,060
This photo was taken is what everyone sees now

1155
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,120
We estimate from the MSI and the observed instruments

1156
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,120
Its wind speed can reach 325 kilometers an hour

1157
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,120
Can you imagine that we can observe a typhoon

1158
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,120
Each hour can reach 325 kilometers

1159
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,120
In November 2013

1160
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,620
There is a typhoon called Haiyan

1161
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,620
His relatives in the Philippines

1162
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,120
We are already called Mount Tai

1163
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,120
Its wind speed is only up to 315 kilometers

1164
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,120
This is a typhoon that we have never seen before

1165
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,120
Its wind speed can reach so high

1166
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,120
A wind speed like this

1167
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,120
how do we describe it

1168
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,120
We can use a tornado as an example

1169
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,120
Here's the U.S. Tornado Scale

1170
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,120
Its side represents its wind speed

1171
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,120
how many kilometers per hour

1172
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,120
The weakest tornado is our moderate typhoon

1173
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:48,120
Its wind speed is about 105-137 every hour

1174
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,120
It is our moderate typhoon in Taiwan that reaches this

1175
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:57,120
Moderate typhoon from middle to this middle speed

1176
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,120
The strongest we call the disastrous tornado

1177
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Its small wind speed is about 322

1178
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
this is very difficult to happen

1179
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And the impact is terrible

1180
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
But it's a tornado

1181
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
What is the extent of the tornado?

1182
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
about 2 kilometers

1183
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
The wind speed of our typhoon is stronger than this

1184
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
It's the equivalent of a catastrophic tornado

1185
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
But its range is more than 150 kilometers

1186
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
so you can hardly imagine

1187
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
We can actually accumulate energy to a point now

1188
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
The typhoon it caused was like a catastrophic tornado

1189
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
it cleans any country anywhere

1190
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
we really can't stop

1191
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
This is how our oceans are warming

1192
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
A difficulty we are facing now

1193
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
You can see we changed our atmosphere

1194
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
our seasons have changed

1195
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
we changed our oceans

1196
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
our torrential rain

1197
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
our typhoon

1198
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Now the form is completely different from the past

1199
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
what do we see next

1200
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
We changed our crust again

1201
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
The energy of our crust is constantly accumulating

1202
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
This continual accumulation has two unfortunate consequences

1203
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
First

1204
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,400
The moisture content of our soil is decreasing rapidly

1205
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,200
Our drought is getting worse all over the world

1206
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,000
another one

1207
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,800
Our Keeneng energy accumulates rapidly

1208
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,600
has affected the physical properties of our crust

1209
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,200
This is more far-reaching

1210
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,300
This is the temperature we actually measured

1211
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,900
This is the temperature inside the atmosphere

1212
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,100
From 900 A.D. to the present

1213
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,500
From historical data, we can observe

1214
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,100
But we only see one fact

1215
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,200
We are now from 1900 onwards

1216
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,400
Our temperature keeps rising

1217
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,300
beyond the past

1218
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,200
A journal recently said

1219
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,500
Our earth should be entering the next ice age

1220
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,000
But because of our human interference

1221
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,800
It's impossible for us to go back to the ice age now

1222
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,600
Our temperature can no longer drop

1223
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,300
We've now reversed up

1224
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,400
And this rise

1225
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,100
It will make the next ice age tens of thousands of years later

1226
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,300
will come back

1227
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,400
Not only does it change the temperature of our atmosphere

1228
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,700
The temperature under our ground now

1229
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,700
Just see the light blue one

1230
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,200
Its temperature is also rising rapidly

1231
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,100
And it's very similar to the temperature of our atmosphere

1232
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,500
not only us

1233
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
air temperature increases

1234
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
The temperature of the soil in our atmosphere

1235
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
is also rising

1236
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
When the temperature of the soil rises

1237
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
it had an unfortunate result

1238
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Its evaporation is constantly increasing

1239
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Once our things are heated

1240
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
we can see our water

1241
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
will leave from the hot place

1242
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
and then into a cold location

1243
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Therefore, the water vapor in our soil has been continuously reduced.

1244
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
all the way from our soil to our surface

1245
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
But to reach the surface is to enter our atmosphere

1246
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
it also gets very hot

1247
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
because the atmosphere is warming

1248
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
So it starts from a low position on the surface

1249
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
just move to a higher position

1250
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
simply put

1251
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
It's like we took a pump

1252
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
keep sucking

1253
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
take the moisture of the soil inside our crust

1254
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
all the way down into the soil into our atmosphere

1255
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Then put it in a higher place

1256
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
The result is the blue dot you see

1257
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
is the moisture in the soil

1258
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
is constantly decreasing

1259
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
This is what we are observing now

1260
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
this was last november

1261
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
We use satellites to see global earth

1262
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,600
Because of the moisture content in the water and soil

1263
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,120
The darker the color, the more coffee it represents

1264
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,080
It has very little moisture and is in the arid category

1265
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,240
As you can see North America is fine

1266
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,120
South America is very serious Southern Africa

1267
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:18,200
Then the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Indian Red Continent

1268
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,760
Indochina Peninsula, Australia and the northern part of mainland China

1269
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,600
Like this every month there is one

1270
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,520
if you take a look

1271
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,800
About half of the world's land

1272
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,800
Now our soil moisture is seriously insufficient

1273
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,600
What does it affect? ​​It affects the production of our agriculture.

1274
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:38,200
Therefore, as the southernization continues to lead forward

1275
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,800
its temperature keeps increasing

1276
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,800
We only see one unfortunate outcome

1277
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,800
The moisture content of our soil is getting lower and lower

1278
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,800
our future agricultural production

1279
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,800
it will be affected very, very badly

1280
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,800
The other is our current earth science

1281
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,800
a subject of very lively debate

1282
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,800
Now when every international conference is held

1283
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,800
We all have a Session that usually provides say

1284
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,800
What now

1285
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,120
its energy accumulates in our crust

1286
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,320
to our earth

1287
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,880
What kind of impact does its geophysical action bring

1288
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,520
we are now on science

1289
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,280
are arguing we have no conclusions

1290
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,160
we only have different opinions

1291
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,280
One of the views I introduced here

1292
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,080
That is, when the warming

1293
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,320
When the heat energy is continuously accumulated and continuously increased

1294
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,280
it stimulates our crust

1295
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,280
plate-to-plate interaction

1296
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,760
Because the plates are expanding

1297
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,520
So you too swell and I swell too

1298
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,960
The friction between them will increase

1299
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,840
plate when it's all expanding

1300
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,360
When the interaction between them increases

1301
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,960
it has two unfortunate consequences

1302
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,360
One is that it squeezes stronger

1303
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,800
Second, when it exceeds the limit it can bear

1304
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,920
It will use volcanic eruptions or earthquakes

1305
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,560
This way to express this energy

1306
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,800
So as the crust becomes more and more active

1307
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,160
We predict more and more earthquakes

1308
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,720
Volcanoes will become more frequent

1309
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,680
At the same time it will grow in size

1310
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,000
so for now

1311
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,400
it's all a hypothesis

1312
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,600
we are still verifying

1313
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,100
But in the verification process

1314
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,700
we'll look at past records

1315
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,500
And past records tell us that

1316
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,200
things to worry about

1317
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,800
actually happening

1318
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,100
That earthquake is for us in Taiwan

1319
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,800
Actually very very important

1320
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,300
because it hurts us a lot

1321
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,900
We in Taiwan have been working hard

1322
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,100
Find a way to do so-called earthquake prediction

1323
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,900
This is what our earth is

1324
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,900
One third of our colleagues

1325
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,400
a job to try to do

1326
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,900
We are all doing earthquake research

1327
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,800
that earthquake prediction

1328
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,000
it does four things

1329
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,200
First

1330
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,800
when do earthquakes happen

1331
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,000
time of occurrence

1332
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,400
the second

1333
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,500
where it happened

1334
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,700
its right place

1335
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,900
how deep is it

1336
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,700
The deeper it is the less it hurts us

1337
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,200
The shallower it hurts us the more

1338
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,400
and this earthquake

1339
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,400
if it happens

1340
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,600
how big is it

1341
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,700
So we do earthquake prediction

1342
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,000
Be sure to tell everyone these four things

1343
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,100
time of earthquake

1344
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:49,800
its location

1345
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,600
its depth

1346
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,700
and its size

1347
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,500
Unfortunately

1348
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,400
We have done so many years of research

1349
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,300
I have been studying in the central government for more than 30 years

1350
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,400
Thirty years

1351
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,300
as soon as i entered

1352
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,300
I started to participate

1353
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Until now we have not broken through

1354
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Now we can't do earthquake prediction right now

1355
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Of course we have a little success

1356
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
But it's not up to the earthquake prediction

1357
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
We can't tell you these ten things

1358
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
So earthquake prediction so far

1359
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
still an impossible task

1360
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
But although we can't do earthquake prediction

1361
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
we can do another thing

1362
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
risk assessment

1363
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Earthquake risk assessment is the same as earthquake prediction

1364
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Earthquake prediction is a very rigorous scientific research

1365
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
But the earthquake risk assessment just tells us that

1366
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
how dangerous is this

1367
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
it's like we buy insurance

1368
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
100 Cars must be insured

1369
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
not that you have to crash

1370
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
must have a car accident

1371
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
But you must buy insurance to prevent

1372
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
in case

1373
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
your damage will be reduced

1374
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
So we tell you today

1375
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
In the following I want to tell you

1376
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
not earthquake prediction

1377
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Seismic Risk Assessment

1378
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
It tells us that what we are facing

1379
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
high risk

1380
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Are we going to make some meaningful preparations?

1381
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
what kind of test are we going to do

1382
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
First

1383
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Is the risk of an earthquake in Taiwan high?

1384
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,400
The first thing I want to tell you is

1385
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,320
We are in an environment with several companies in one sector

1386
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,120
our stakes are high

1387
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,680
In 2015 we had several earthquakes

1388
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,120
They are all an environment of several tectonic plates

1389
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:20,440
These are the two major earthquakes that occurred in Nepal on April 25 and May 12, 2015

1390
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,600
A scale 7.8

1391
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,160
A scale 7.3

1392
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,600
That is an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.3 that occurred off the coast of Chile on September 17

1393
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,000
It is just two plates

1394
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,760
How far down this plate

1395
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,600
Then an earthquake caused by the rupture of the earth's crust

1396
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:41,120
The other one was the massive earthquake that hit the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in October

1397
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,880
This is a few plates

1398
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,320
An unfortunate result of the Indian Ocean plate and the Eurasian plate

1399
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,520
Taiwan is

1400
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,720
We are a Eurasian plate and the Philippine Sea plate

1401
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,200
An environment created by several companies on the Eurasian continental plate

1402
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,000
our bluefish to this

1403
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,760
Due to the relationship between several pressures, Henghu is shortening every year. By how much?

1404
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,680
about eight centimeters

1405
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,480
In terms of the pressure of this place, how much it shortens is about five to six centimeters

1406
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,320
It's the same here, about five to six centimeters per year

1407
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,640
So we are constantly pressing and colliding on one plate

1408
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:17,520
one of

1409
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:23,560
In an environment where energy accumulates, so we are the first. We are inherently prone to earthquakes

1410
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,760
Our risk is high, it's a part of our nature

1411
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,840
Second, has the warming around us brought some impact to us?

1412
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,880
It seems to be evolving in this direction

1413
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,520
This is an article in the geophysics newsletter

1414
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,360
This is an interesting article from 2014

1415
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:49,160
He put all earthquakes with a magnitude greater than seven or more from 1979 until March 2014

1416
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,680
He lists him all and calculates his frequency and he can see it

1417
00:51:53,680 --> 00:52:00,080
In the past, the frequency was about ten times a year, and then it increased to 12 times, and now it is about 17 times a year.

1418
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,680
about

1419
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,360
so its frequency is changing

1420
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,600
and more and more

1421
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,200
faster and faster

1422
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,960
It's just that it can happen a lot in a year

1423
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,880
and its size

1424
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,720
scale seven one scale eight its energy is to participate

1425
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,280
32 times the difference

1426
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,760
32 times over here

1427
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,160
So the difference between July 1 and September is 900

1428
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,000
That is, the frequency is 1000 times

1429
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,040
so you can watch this too

1430
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,280
Its energy is actually increasing

1431
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,960
So we observe from this actual data

1432
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,360
I have also seen the past few decades

1433
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,040
The scale at which our major earthquakes occur

1434
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,680
And its frequency is increasing

1435
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,320
Let's use another number

1436
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,920
This is the US Geological Survey

1437
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,800
It puts this all right globally

1438
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,120
It has the scale of what happens on the Global Seismic Network

1439
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,160
put it in place

1440
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,600
its size lists it

1441
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,560
We have had this complete report since 1973

1442
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,320
We take this data and throw it away

1443
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,440
we can also see

1444
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,960
Since 1990

1445
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,840
The number of times this major earthquake occurred in the world

1446
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,560
is indeed increasing

1447
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,880
and increasing very fast

1448
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,200
The average year is about this position

1449
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,200
that's ten times that's fifteen times

1450
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,600
so about eleven times

1451
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,600
Now it's about sixteen times a year

1452
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,000
It is actually similar to the study we saw just now.

1453
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,600
But the last few years have been different

1454
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,800
this is 2010

1455
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,200
You can see that it has been more than 20 times until now

1456
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,200
This is a rare thing in the past

1457
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,800
But it's all happened now

1458
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,800
he told us

1459
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,600
Yes, the conditions of our background are actually changing

1460
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,000
We now have more large earthquakes and they are relatively strong.

1461
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,400
So this is the second factor

1462
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,600
Tell us our risks are not small

1463
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,000
The third is our own Taiwan

1464
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,400
Of course we in Taiwan have very few

1465
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,800
You have seen earthquakes with a magnitude of seven or more

1466
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,000
We usually scale 3, 4, 5

1467
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,600
scale 6 we'll have some disasters

1468
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,400
Scale 7 usually only happens once every 30 years

1469
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,000
But now even if it's a felt earthquake

1470
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,400
These earthquakes are about magnitude 3 or above

1471
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,200
The number of times every year is also different from the past

1472
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,800
This was before the 1999 Jiji earthquake

1473
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,880
The average number of felt low earthquakes in a year is about 58

1474
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,080
So you can see that it's probably like this

1475
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,480
just 100 times

1476
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,960
it's probably in this place

1477
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,400
Its line has been deformed a bit

1478
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,600
From 1999 to 2008

1479
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,200
This is the one you see

1480
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,880
Its count has risen from 58

1481
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,800
Jump to 407

1482
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,280
probably in this place

1483
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,240
But since 2009

1484
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,680
You can see this one

1485
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,280
until the previous year

1486
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,840
what is its average

1487
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,840
more than 600

1488
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,640
So it's obvious

1489
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,440
That's how it has been for more than 20 years

1490
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,360
We can see the low earthquake in Taiwan

1491
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,640
It's just that the frequency of low vibrations has increased.

1492
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,040
it shakes low every time

1493
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,840
In fact, it is a release of energy

1494
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,200
This means that the energy we can release

1495
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,640
growing bigger and bigger

1496
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,080
It also means that our crust

1497
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,440
In fact, the accumulated energy

1498
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,280
Also through these low vibrations to express

1499
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,960
It's just that the more energy accumulated

1500
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,680
The number of times this low vibration will be expressed in the future

1501
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,120
The scale will be larger

1502
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,120
So this is the third risk we have

1503
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,680
Actually it's not too small

1504
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,880
what is the fourth

1505
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,580
The fourth is that we have some relations with Japan

1506
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:09,280
This is our plate distribution in the western Pacific

1507
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,780
This is the Philippine Sea Plate

1508
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,080
This is the Eurasian plate

1509
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,080
this is our taiwan

1510
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,480
this is japan this is philippines

1511
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,980
Four or three of our countries are in the Western Pacific

1512
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,880
And both are affected by the extrusion of these two plates

1513
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,880
This is the Philippine Sea plate squeezing Eurasia

1514
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,580
We got Taiwan up

1515
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,580
Japan is like us

1516
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,080
Philippine Sea plate

1517
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,280
Eurasian continental plate

1518
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,380
but more complicated than us

1519
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,380
It also has the Pacific sea plate and the North American continental plate

1520
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,880
So it's four plates pressed together

1521
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,780
So the earthquake in Japan is stronger than ours

1522
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,280
It does more damage than us

1523
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,580
about ten times as much as ours

1524
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,280
We look at the past century

1525
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,180
There are four earthquakes in Japan that are somewhat related to us

1526
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,480
Which four earthquakes came

1527
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,480
The first is the 1896 earthquake we call Sanriku

1528
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,780
It occurs at the boundary of these two plates

1529
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,780
It's very strong with 8.5 on the scale

1530
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,080
More than 20,000 people died

1531
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,180
The second happened in 1923

1532
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
What happened in the Kanto region is called

1533
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Great Kanto Earthquake

1534
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It has a scale of 7.9

1535
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
It killed more than 140,000 people

1536
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Because of the fire in winter

1537
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
The third is 1995

1538
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
happened in this place

1539
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
A magnitude 7.3 earthquake

1540
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
More than 6,000 people died

1541
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
just a bit behind the plate

1542
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
The fourth is 2011

1543
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Happened off the coast of Tohoku, Japan

1544
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
The so-called Great Tohoku Offshore Earthquake

1545
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
scale 9

1546
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
More than 27,000 people died

1547
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
also caused sea cliffs and

1548
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
this death at national power plant

1549
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
compound disaster

1550
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
These four earthquakes

1551
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
What is its relationship with Taiwan?

1552
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
We can use this graph to represent

1553
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
This is from 1900

1554
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Earthquakes all over the world

1555
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
This is on a scale over 7.5

1556
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
It will be more and more densely distributed

1557
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Then the scale is getting stronger and stronger

1558
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
We just talked about the three earthquakes

1559
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
In terms of this time series

1560
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
1896,1923,1995

1561
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
These are the three earthquakes in Japan

1562
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
What is the relationship between these three earthquakes and our Taiwan?

1563
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Because just these earthquakes

1564
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,400
when these earthquakes

1565
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,800
Then it happened in Taiwan

1566
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,000
large earthquake

1567
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,400
And the death toll is more than 1000 people

1568
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,400
We just saw that Japan is full of ten thousand people

1569
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,600
we are thousands

1570
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,400
So we're basically one-tenth of it

1571
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,600
but for us

1572
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,400
More than 1,000 people are considered a very serious earthquake

1573
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,200
This is Meishan in 1906

1574
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,000
This is the 1935 Hsinchu-Taichung Earthquake

1575
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,400
We all remember the 1990s

1576
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,600
GG Earthquake

1577
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,000
Now it has this earthquake again

1578
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,800
2011 Great Tohoku Offshore Earthquake

1579
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,200
scale is 9

1580
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,200
We see records of past history

1581
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,200
with experience

1582
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,200
Every time there is a major earthquake in Japan

1583
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,000
after a while

1584
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,200
we will happen

1585
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,000
about 10 years like this

1586
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,400
This is about 11 years old

1587
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,000
This is about 5 years

1588
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,600
Next we want to say

1589
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,200
Now there is another one in Japan

1590
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,200
stronger scale

1591
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,600
a bigger earthquake

1592
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,400
Will there be a big earthquake in Taiwan?

1593
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,800
we actually don't know

1594
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,400
Because we can't do earthquake prediction

1595
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,600
but we can say

1596
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,200
we risk a lot

1597
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Because of past experience with this history

1598
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
we come now don't ignore

1599
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
So now we've told everyone

1600
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
we have another

1601
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
from our own environment

1602
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Earthquakes around the world

1603
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
This phenomenon of oxidation that occurs

1604
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
our this

1605
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
An increase in earthquakes felt by oneself

1606
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Our relationship with Japan

1607
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
so when will a big earthquake happen

1608
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
we do not know

1609
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
but you can see

1610
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
about 10 years ago

1611
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
In Japan, it absorbs shock and releases energy

1612
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
will be accumulated on our side in Taiwan

1613
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Then let's also generate a scale

1614
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
large earthquake

1615
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
But this time only 5 years left

1616
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
if we say yes

1617
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
next big earthquake

1618
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
5 years too

1619
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
follow last time

1620
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
this is 2011

1621
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Then our time is actually very very close

1622
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
that's pretty much where we are now

1623
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
so we think

1624
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Our stakes are really high

1625
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Because there is such a high risk

1626
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So we were in April last year

1627
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
our center

1628
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,560
published a policy proposal

1629
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,440
Proposal on the Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Large-Scale Earthquake Disasters

1630
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,520
just saw it and said

1631
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,800
Our Taiwan has recently

1632
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,080
As our entire environment changes

1633
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,920
Our earthquake risk is increasing

1634
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,040
We are not saying that there will be a major earthquake

1635
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,320
But our risk is very high

1636
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,160
like the plane we're on now

1637
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,840
is malaysia airlines

1638
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,520
So all our precautions

1639
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,760
Amount of our insurance

1640
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,560
will be different from others

1641
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,200
So in this policy proposal

1642
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,600
we specifically mentioned

1643
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,440
There are three important policy objectives

1644
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,600
I hope to remind the government to work in this direction

1645
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,000
The first one, do not open the old house

1646
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,800
The second our lives to ensure

1647
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,200
The third function of our society cannot be stopped

1648
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,480
big earthquake can come

1649
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,720
But when the earthquake happened

1650
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,520
We will definitely be able to make our prevention trails

1651
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,800
our life assured

1652
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,320
The functioning of our society is sustainable

1653
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,640
That's what we want the government to work on

1654
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,280
so this is us

1655
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:59,240
I hope everyone can also notice

1656
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,120
that used to be from

1657
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,800
From 1901 to 2015

1658
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,600
There have been earthquakes of this magnitude above six in Taiwan.

1659
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,900
if we draw it

1660
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,500
It's the drop-down map you see

1661
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,200
All the stars represent scales over six

1662
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,300
It will hurt us a little bit

1663
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,500
impact on us

1664
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,700
must not be ignored

1665
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,000
it is basically divided into three places

1666
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
One is our northeast earthquake belt

1667
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,800
The other one is the Western Seismic Belt

1668
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,800
Another one is the Northeast Earthquake Belt

1669
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,800
then we just said

1670
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,500
Which of these three earthquake zones is the most dangerous

1671
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,800
That's the Western Seismic Belt, of course.

1672
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,300
why

1673
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,700
Because of these three big earthquakes that we just saw

1674
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:33,000
It is mainly in our western seismic zone

1675
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,300
Taichung Miaoli in 1935 This

1676
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,900
And the miracle of 1999

1677
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:40,200
Meishan in 1900

1678
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,800
They are all in our western seismic zone

1679
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:45,700
Because the extrusion of this place is very significant

1680
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,600
But it has very few small earthquakes

1681
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,700
We just saw 600+ oil rod quakes a year

1682
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,200
More than three quarters are in our Northeast earthquake zone

1683
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,600
just let it out

1684
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,000
just knock the energy out of it

1685
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,500
But the western earthquake zone will be less fat

1686
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,300
So this place is still our style

1687
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
most severe

1688
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,400
So everyone must not ignore

1689
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,000
There's one more thing we're worried about

1690
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,800
It is the Taipei Metropolitan Area in our Northeast Earthquake Zone

1691
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,300
You can see we had an earthquake in the past

1692
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,500
But in the past this was 100 years ago

1693
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,200
It is different from our current conditions

1694
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,000
There are now more than 6 million people in Taipei City

1695
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,700
Not only do we now have a large population

1696
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,700
we have a very important construction

1697
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,300
our MRT our subway

1698
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,500
Our high-speed trains are all underground

1699
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,400
So if an earthquake occurs in this place

1700
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,500
the harm done to us

1701
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,000
Of course you can't ignore

1702
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
In addition to the earthquake on the earthquake road

1703
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,200
If it happened off our northeast coast

1704
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,300
This is the Okinawa Trench

1705
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,700
Our southwest coast is the Manila Trench

1706
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:42,200
It will also have a tsunami formation

1707
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,000
in the qing dynasty

1708
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,800
Whether it's Kaohsiung, Tainan or Keelung

1709
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,300
There are records of tsunamis

1710
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,300
just tell us

1711
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,000
There was an undersea earthquake

1712
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,700
So if this time it happened in the Northeast Sea too,

1713
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,300
There will also be a tsunami risk like Japan

1714
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,900
This is something we must never ignore

1715
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:00,400
So our northeast coast and our new South China Sea

1716
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,640
The south coast is where we need to pay special attention

1717
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:04,940
this is what we just saw

1718
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,700
From the atmosphere to the ocean

1719
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:07,640
to our crust

1720
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,540
Next, I will add one more

1721
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:13,080
It is the edge of our mountain and the two levels

1722
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,740
The white piece of ice dust that you see

1723
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:17,080
Its energy is also accumulating

1724
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,800
This accumulation affects us

1725
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,100
actually very profound

1726
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,040
It's actually the same as our crust

1727
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,640
but its impact on us

1728
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,300
It is also what we are about to face

1729
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,840
The first one is in this ice dust

1730
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,040
because it melts fast

1731
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,540
It also makes our temperature rise very, very obvious

1732
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:36,140
Its impact is in the two-level region

1733
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:39,440
The impact on our world is very, very serious

1734
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,540
Even more frightening is that it not only affects the climate

1735
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:43,040
Affecting the rise of the north face of the sea

1736
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,340
will also affect the stability of our crust in the future

1737
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,840
In other words, it will indirectly affect our earthquakes

1738
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,240
volcano it's this happening

1739
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,840
This is from 2000 to 2009

1740
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:56,440
We put the whole world where the temperature is rising

1741
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,640
make a consolidation

1742
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,640
The decade's record

1743
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,300
The warmed place is the reddest and deepest place

1744
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:03,840
We can see that there are two places

1745
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,640
One is the Arctic

1746
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,440
One is the Antarctic Peninsula

1747
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,480
These two places are our polar regions

1748
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,340
It heats up not only the fastest

1749
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:13,840
At the same time, it has a great impact on us

1750
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:17,040
What I want to introduce to you today is our Arctic region

1751
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,680
Because the Antarctic region basically

1752
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:22,680
It is only limited to the Antarctic Peninsula and the seven continents.

1753
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,180
Other places are pretty good

1754
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:27,680
Our more pressing concern is our Arctic Circle

1755
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,460
This time the arctic shock

1756
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:32,280
It spread from here

1757
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:36,960
The warming of the Arctic Circle is currently the largest in the world

1758
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,880
we talked about sea level rise

1759
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,680
We must mention three

1760
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,760
One is the ice city above our Antarctic continent

1761
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,820
very thick

1762
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,620
One is Greenland in the Northern Hemisphere

1763
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:50,920
The roadside above it is also very anti-big

1764
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,220
The third is all our alpine glaciers

1765
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:54,560
But all alpine glaciers

1766
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,420
you add up all its ice

1767
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:59,300
Its volume is 180,000 cubic kilometers

1768
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,000
one cubic kilometer

1769
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,200
is eleven tons of water

1770
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,240
The effect it can have at our sea level

1771
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,040
Actually not high

1772
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,540
probably all melted

1773
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,340
It's only half a meter up

1774
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,200
This is measured in meters

1775
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,200
we are more worried

1776
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,740
One is Greenland in the northern hemisphere

1777
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,540
it will take us over six meters

1778
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:16,900
The other is our entire Antarctic continent

1779
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:17,900
Antarctica you can see

1780
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:20,440
All add up to more than 70 meters

1781
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,540
So those are the two things we're most worried about

1782
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,600
This piece is what I want today

1783
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,400
I would like to introduce you to Greenland

1784
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,000
in our northern hemisphere

1785
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,340
This is Antarctica

1786
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,340
Antarctica is the fastest-heating continent we have right now

1787
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,000
This is the Antarctic Peninsula

1788
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,840
Then there's West Antarctica

1789
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:38,800
Because the area of ​​the ice sheet on the West Antarctic Continent melts

1790
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,500
would raise the sea level by eight meters

1791
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,340
But so far its impact

1792
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,340
Not so fast and obvious

1793
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:46,340
Our biggest concern right now is Greenland

1794
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,500
this is greenland

1795
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,600
this is our arctic ocean

1796
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,840
this is our arctic

1797
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:54,540
Its impact is actually very, very serious

1798
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:55,640
I just said Arctic

1799
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,800
If all of this Greenland melts

1800
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,260
Global sea levels will rise

1801
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,000
Exceed

1802
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:00,720
6 meters

1803
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,720
That is to say, this piece

1804
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,160
So what is the biggest impact of this piece?

1805
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,480
This is the Arctic Ocean

1806
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,160
Arctic Ocean due to warming

1807
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,520
it's gone

1808
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,720
It melts very, very fast

1809
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,640
But the Arctic Ocean is a seashore

1810
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,520
Greenland is the land bank

1811
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,000
The beach is the water in the glass

1812
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,720
It melts the water inside the cup does not rise

1813
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:24,200
But it is a protected plant of Greenland

1814
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,440
that is, its moderation

1815
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,280
Without this Arctic Ocean Greenland

1816
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,960
The barrier will be lost in an instant

1817
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,400
it will melt quickly

1818
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:35,400
So the Arctic Ocean is where we do this climate observation

1819
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,600
A very important observation indicator

1820
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,120
I just said this indicator

1821
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,360
in 2015

1822
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,720
it used to be in winter

1823
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,320
The area of ​​its ice sheet has become very, very small

1824
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,880
lowest since dominance

1825
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,840
What you can see on the picture is from 1979

1826
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:54,360
Until the biggest winter of 2015

1827
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,120
This waterfront area we call March

1828
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,800
It's the youngest time in summer

1829
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,520
We call the seaside area of ​​september

1830
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,600
A curve of the two changes of seashore area

1831
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,000
This is what we just saw

1832
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
so-called March

1833
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
the biggest winter

1834
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Last March was the lowest in this place

1835
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Why should we worry so much at our lowest?

1836
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
because in the past

1837
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
every time its lowest

1838
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
The last time it was 2006

1839
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
this is 2011

1840
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
they are very low

1841
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
every time it's low

1842
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Next we summer every other summer

1843
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Its beach area is even lower

1844
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
So you can see in 2006 this is 2007

1845
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
it's very low

1846
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
2011 it was 2012

1847
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
what is this now

1848
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
2015

1849
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
So we predict that by 2016

1850
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Our summer waterfront area

1851
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
It will probably be lower than this

1852
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
2012 was the lowest

1853
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
How much of its ice sheet remains in summer

1854
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
3.41 million square kilometers

1855
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
how much in the past

1856
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
past in this

1857
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
before

1858
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
In 1980 it was about the same

1859
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
7.9 million

1860
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,400
Nearly 8 million square kilometers

1861
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,000
Now there are only about 3 million left

1862
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,600
Then this year, there will be only about 4 million square kilometers left.

1863
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,900
Then next year will be this year

1864
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,300
This is the September we are facing now

1865
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:15,200
We estimate that it will be lower than 3.41 million

1866
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,300
follow this trend

1867
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,800
You don't need this very accurate model like ours

1868
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:24,600
or our simulation to predict

1869
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,400
We just use simple math

1870
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,200
we can all tell

1871
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,700
According to the trend like this

1872
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,600
when will we see

1873
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,100
There is a summer in the Arctic Ocean without soldiers

1874
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,300
Of course there will be winter

1875
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:36,700
will summer appear

1876
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,300
From this estimate

1877
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:42,300
Probably no more than 2030

1878
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,700
We are now in 2016

1879
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,500
So we really don't have much time

1880
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,300
When this is before 2030

1881
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,700
the piece we saw

1882
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:51,900
This is called the Arctic Ocean coast

1883
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,800
This was in 2012

1884
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,500
Then in the future it will be smaller than this sea

1885
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,400
then getting smaller

1886
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,200
Getting smaller and smaller

1887
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,400
will eventually disappear

1888
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,600
when it disappears

1889
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,960
will happen

1890
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,960
Then I won't talk about other things today.

1891
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,260
I only talk about this matter

1892
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:07,960
That's when the Arctic Sun has no ice in the summer

1893
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,300
The first to be affected was Greenland

1894
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,160
Greenland is so thick

1895
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,200
2.6 million tens of thousands of cubic kilometers of water

1896
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,360
will be affected

1897
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,760
It only needs to disappear 1/1

1898
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,660
Our global sea level will rise by 60 cm

1899
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:24,000
So the sea level will be affected by the arctic sun

1900
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,400
when there is no summer

1901
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,760
will start to speed up the dissolution of Greenland

1902
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,020
Then the global sea level will rise by leaps and bounds

1903
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:34,360
This is a problem we are going to face now

1904
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,360
And it's not that long

1905
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,020
Following the trend we just looked at

1906
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:41,120
We'll have to face it before 2030

1907
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:46,760
This is the IPCC on a seminar

1908
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,320
a data published by it

1909
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,460
it tells us

1910
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:52,120
From 1900 to the present and the future

1911
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,820
Possible Trends in Our Global Sea Level Rise

1912
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:56,920
The future is of course blue and this is history

1913
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,520
This is the one you see

1914
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,080
this is 1900

1915
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,040
until 2000

1916
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,860
The world has risen in 100 years

1917
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:05,640
this is centimeters

1918
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,540
Rise about 20 cm

1919
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:09,600
So the average year is 0.2 cm

1920
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,680
is 2 kilometers

1921
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,340
But in the future our sea level

1922
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:14,080
100 years 200 years 300 years

1923
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,740
Just continue to rise in this way

1924
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:19,240
Its inaccuracy is our gray area

1925
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,340
but now we all know

1926
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:23,840
This estimate is too conservative

1927
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,240
not accurate anymore

1928
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,240
now we know that

1929
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,440
before 2000

1930
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,840
It was originally estimated to be only one meter at most

1931
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,040
now we find

1932
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,340
Words go so fast with our environment

1933
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,680
the edge of our two levels

1934
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,240
it disappears so quickly

1935
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,540
It has such a big impact

1936
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,640
we now know that

1937
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,240
Probably at least one meter

1938
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,680
How many more than one meter

1939
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,440
we don't really have an answer right now

1940
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,440
we totally want to see

1941
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:49,580
We can slow climate warming in the future

1942
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:52,800
Then let it happen how slowly you decide

1943
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,000
But we are now one meter

1944
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,780
Probably can't escape

1945
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:57,880
So now I'm going to tell you that it's unfortunate

1946
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,140
before 2000

1947
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:00,140
we rise below

1948
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,720
one meter

1949
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,240
How much have we been in the past 100 years

1950
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,160
20 cm

1951
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,360
But the next 100 years is one meter

1952
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,240
The difference is really, really big

1953
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,760
So 21st century sea level

1954
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,040
rapid rise like this

1955
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,000
Let's face the very terrible

1956
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,640
We just said that the 21st century is the century of high temperature

1957
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,160
is the century of extreme change in water resources

1958
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,800
It is our agricultural production that will be impacted

1959
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,120
a century of famine

1960
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,640
But when the sea level rises

1961
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,680
it tells us

1962
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,360
all the coasts of the world

1963
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:32,040
Its population is rapidly beginning to migrate

1964
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,920
move to higher places

1965
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:36,920
So this is a century of great migration

1966
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,600
The same is true of our Taiwan

1967
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,400
Mainland China has actually been hit very, very hard

1968
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,240
So if we are going to develop in mainland China

1969
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,400
These are the ones to avoid in particular

1970
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,840
places that will be hit in the future

1971
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:48,840
our taiwan

1972
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,640
If we use a 3D topographic map to show it

1973
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:52,440
that's it

1974
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,520
The very low place in this picture is the altitude

1975
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,440
Below 25 meters

1976
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,120
all these dark blue

1977
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,120
then light blue

1978
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,680
The gray ones are places below 100 meters above sea level

1979
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:06,560
The yellow ones are places above 100 meters above sea level

1980
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,120
Above 100 meters is

1981
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,920
When Antarctica Melts

1982
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,320
we won't be drowned

1983
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,160
This is where Taiwan will always be

1984
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:18,000
So Taiwan now we still have these dark blue locations

1985
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,400
But slowly with warming

1986
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,680
it will slowly disappear

1987
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,440
It has a huge impact on us

1988
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,640
You can see that the Lanyang Plain is missing

1989
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:25,680
Our Taipei Basin

1990
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,480
many people don't know

1991
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,360
Three-quarters of the area of ​​our Taipei land

1992
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,880
All below 20 meters

1993
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,480
Therefore, after the sea plain rises in the future,

1994
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,160
Along this Guandu this love mouth

1995
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,320
it will slowly sink in

1996
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,640
our west coast

1997
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,600
Especially from the south of Changhua

1998
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,960
until our Pingtung

1999
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,800
The impact is actually very, very big

2000
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,640
In fact, we don't have much time for shadows

2001
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,720
we just said

2002
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:47,800
when this arctic sun it has no ice in summer

2003
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,320
This phenomenon will start to become more and more serious

2004
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,680
Then we don't have much time

2005
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,160
We are now so shadowy time

2006
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,920
only ten years

2007
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:56,960
not more than one generation

2008
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,480
So we really need to go well

2009
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,200
face the shadow

2010
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
This is our current Taipei local

2011
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
This Taipei local is now crowded with more than 6 million people

2012
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
We thought we could stay in Taipei for the rest of our lives

2013
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
We can all develop assets here

2014
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
but we were all wrong

2015
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
With this warming

2016
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
With our rapidly changing environment

2017
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
We estimate that in the next one or two hundred years, Taipei

2018
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
it will start to change rapidly

2019
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
it will make many of us

2020
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
because of sea level rise

2021
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Because the water in it can't drain out

2022
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
It began to make it impossible for many people to live here

2023
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
finally have to leave

2024
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
So the locals in Taipei actually started from this

2025
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
For our earth science research

2026
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
it's actually very dangerous

2027
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
We have to migrate slowly to higher places

2028
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
but we don't have much time

2029
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
More than 6 million people

2030
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
if you want to migrate it

2031
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
how do you migrate

2032
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
in such a short time

2033
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
in such a limited time

2034
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
So I put just that

2035
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
This picture of IPCC, this energy accumulation

2036
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
From atmosphere to ocean to crust

2037
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
until the edge of Gao Shan's two levels

2038
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
tell everyone

2039
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,560
we created an unfortunate environment

2040
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,400
we made a terrible crop

2041
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,840
we hurt our earth

2042
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,640
which in turn affects us

2043
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,080
So the twenty-first century is a

2044
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,320
post period extreme change catastrophe life time era

2045
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,160
We are now suffering a consequence of this

2046
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,960
This is the German debt insurance company

2047
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,640
A picture he accumulated and published

2048
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:23,080
He began to report natural disasters all over the world in 1980

2049
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:25,440
accumulate it with different scales

2050
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,800
We can see that this is the number of times a year

2051
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,200
Average times over the past year

2052
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,400
400 times at 200 times

2053
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,720
about 300 times

2054
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,640
Then it went up to 500 times

2055
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,480
Then received 700 times

2056
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:38,000
In the past ten years

2057
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,360
It has probably risen to about 900 times

2058
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,320
Last year, more than 1,000 times

2059
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,600
so we only see one result

2060
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,120
With this global warming

2061
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,960
With the increasing number of natural disasters

2062
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,560
Disasters we face

2063
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,080
In fact, more and more dangerous

2064
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,920
It's hurting us more and more

2065
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,040
Taiwan is a natural disaster

2066
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,280
very big place

2067
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:00,120
Disasters that 73% of us face

2068
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,400
three types of natural disasters

2069
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:04,500
90% of us need to face two kinds of natural disasters

2070
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,900
But with global warming

2071
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:08,000
Our ecological environment has been harmed so much

2072
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,200
our risk is greater

2073
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,700
Our challenge is higher

2074
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:14,500
In the knowledge test of the previous month

2075
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,500
Director Lin of the Political Institute

2076
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,300
gave us the season theory

2077
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:22,100
During the season he talked about two things

2078
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,600
That is to say, suppose there are two people

2079
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,700
Both men were caught by the police

2080
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:27,100
if they cooperate

2081
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,900
They will serve the shortest time in prison

2082
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:31,100
They can all get the best result

2083
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,500
if they both betray each other

2084
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,700
both of them will be unlucky

2085
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:38,300
The season theory is not only applied to our politics

2086
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,300
Applied in many fields of our

2087
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:42,300
also applied to our climate change

2088
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:44,100
Our Climate Change Now

2089
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,900
The vice president we just said

2090
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:50,200
Just passed the Paris climate negotiations

2091
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:53,100
Climate negotiations is a very important season theory

2092
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,100
he told us

2093
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,300
We must never again harm our environment

2094
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:59,900
We can no longer see ourselves like this

2095
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,400
two people are the same

2096
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:06,200
Let's do the biggest damage to each other

2097
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,600
with torture

2098
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,800
we must sacrifice ourselves

2099
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,200
We would rather sacrifice ourselves first

2100
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,600
benefit each other

2101
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,200
Although we won't get the biggest

2102
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,800
We won't get the maximum number of points ourselves

2103
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,000
But the result of our joint efforts

2104
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,800
will make our environment better

2105
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,800
this is our climate change

2106
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,400
One of the most important of our negotiations

2107
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,200
That is to say

2108
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,800
we must first sacrifice ourselves

2109
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,400
Then complete our overall situation

2110
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:36,800
And perfect our earth our future

2111
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,000
in this case

2112
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,200
All we have to do is two very important things

2113
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,000
the whole world has to do

2114
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,200
The first must be simple and simple

2115
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,600
is that we just saw all these changes

2116
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,400
The first one, its change will be relatively small

2117
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,600
it is slower

2118
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,200
It used to be like this

2119
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,800
now we can slowly

2120
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,400
give us more time to deal with

2121
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,600
And then let this change make us more bearable

2122
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,800
But there is another thing I want to remind everyone

2123
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,400
What cannot be ignored is the housing debt

2124
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:03,740
in 101 years

2125
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:04,760
The Executive Yuan also announced

2126
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:07,000
National Climate Change Adaptation Policy Framework

2127
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:08,000
in this program

2128
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,860
In fact, the two most important points

2129
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,460
One is that we must start reducing energy and carbon

2130
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,660
to slow down

2131
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,140
Second, we must start to make some adjustments

2132
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:18,560
The so-called adjustment is what we just said

2133
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:20,600
Be sure to start doing housing debt operations

2134
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:22,540
How can we reduce energy and carbon?

2135
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:23,860
we still need time

2136
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,460
All countries in the world need to work hard to achieve this operation

2137
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:28,960
We are now in 2016

2138
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,020
right here

2139
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,820
We emit so much carbon a year

2140
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,720
If we can work together globally

2141
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:36,720
We're probably headed in this direction

2142
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:38,460
We will now line up for a year

2143
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:42,560
The total amount is about 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide

2144
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,320
but we are willing to do these things

2145
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:46,560
Carbon Pujo Storage Renewable Energy Nuclear Energy

2146
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:47,760
Of course we cannot use nuclear energy in Taiwan

2147
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,360
We replace it with other

2148
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,120
We increase power generation efficiency

2149
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:54,120
Fuel Switching Energy use replace it

2150
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:56,460
We even increased our debuff

2151
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,120
with our efficiency

2152
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,120
we can walk slowly from here

2153
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,480
We hope that by 2050

2154
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,840
The world can drop to 141 tons

2155
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,960
if we can do this

2156
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,320
The agricultural soil of our large strata will not break through

2157
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:12,360
WE JUST SEE THE TERRIBLE THRESHOLD OF 450

2158
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,040
but we need 35 years

2159
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,400
In 35 years we tried to do it

2160
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,600
when we do really well

2161
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,400
Maybe we can do that

2162
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,040
But in 35 years

2163
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,880
The temperature of our atmosphere will increase

2164
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,000
our carbon dioxide

2165
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,120
People are continuing our accumulation

2166
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,200
what we just saw

2167
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,640
From the atmosphere to the ocean to our subterranean world

2168
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,560
even the two armies

2169
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,640
it condition won't go away

2170
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,200
Even in terms of Arctic ice

2171
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,640
by this time

2172
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,240
We have no ice in summer

2173
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,520
so what do we have to suffer

2174
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,800
And bear with what we just saw

2175
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:41,880
seasonal changes

2176
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,560
Heavy rain, typhoons, even volcanic earthquakes

2177
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,760
And our sea level is rising rapidly

2178
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:47,960
The impact

2179
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,840
So what I want to tell you today is

2180
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,240
absolutely simple must do

2181
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,560
But don't ignore

2182
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,320
That's what we're going to do now

2183
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,600
that we're going to start doing

2184
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,160
facing our natural disasters

2185
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,000
every year in the future

2186
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,600
We all have to face typhoons, torrential rains, flooding, mountain landslides, high temperature and heat

2187
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,400
The cold wave we are facing today is actually a small one

2188
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,400
are local

2189
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,600
The real shocks we face are these

2190
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,800
Also, our recent earthquake risk is very high

2191
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,400
So you must not ignore this one or two years

2192
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,800
That is, our earthquake risk is very high

2193
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:18,600
we have to prepare

2194
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:19,800
we all hope he doesn't come

2195
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,800
but we don't know if he will come

2196
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,600
we are not sure

2197
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,800
The only thing we can do is to prepare for earthquakes

2198
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,600
More importantly, don't ignore

2199
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,800
before 2030

2200
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,400
If there is really no ice in Beibinyang

2201
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,600
According to this trend

2202
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,200
It may be difficult for us to recover

2203
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,700
the sea level will rise faster

2204
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,400
Our bay digs will flood

2205
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,500
Increased majesty

2206
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,700
We probably can't escape the large-scale semi-relocation

2207
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:41,500
So if we are not ready now

2208
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,100
the future is too late

2209
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:45,600
That's what we have to face in the future

2210
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,900
How about facing this before?

2211
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:47,900
just tell us

2212
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:51,500
We must do self-disaster, disaster prevention, disaster avoidance and disaster prevention

2213
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,700
I share with you today

2214
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,700
I accumulated all these data

2215
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,200
the main thing is

2216
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:58,900
Give everyone a knowledge to build this foundation

2217
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,000
this basic knowledge

2218
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,200
It's useless to know

2219
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,400
More importantly, I hope everyone can do a good job in disaster prevention

2220
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,400
Disaster avoidance and disaster relief work

2221
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,900
These jobs are the most important

2222
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:09,300
that's here today

2223
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,400
when you come in

2224
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,900
Our secretary colleagues give everyone

2225
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,000
will send a so-called

2226
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,600
Emergency Shelter Kit Manual

2227
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,000
that besides this

2228
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,300
In fact, our local government

2229
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:22,200
have done some meaningful work

2230
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,500
Like the Taipei City Government has one

2231
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:24,900
Disaster Prevention Handbook for Citizens

2232
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,500
Many people may have already downloaded

2233
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,300
if not downloaded

2234
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:29,100
You must go home today

2235
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,500
I will download this manual

2236
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,700
He put us when natural disasters happen

2237
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,000
what should we do

2238
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
how to prevent

2239
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,400
put it all in

2240
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,300
integrated in

2241
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:39,000
Everyone must take a good look

2242
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,500
Then start to prepare for this disaster prevention

2243
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,500
In the future this is September 2010

2244
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,900
Flooding situation of Typhoon Vanabye in Kaohsiung

2245
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,100
will this happen

2246
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:48,900
still happens

2247
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:49,900
And it will be better than this in the future

2248
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:52,100
More severe floods will occur

2249
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:53,300
what is this

2250
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,400
This is our Taipei metropolitan area

2251
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,900
Including Taoyuan around us

2252
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:00,000
Our flooded landslides

2253
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
it risks this position

2254
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,600
Then you can look inside your home

2255
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,200
Is it in these high-risk places?

2256
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,100
if it is a high place

2257
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,500
we take the necessary precautions

2258
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,900
That was March 2003

2259
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:16,700
What reservoir is dry and almost no water can be seen in it?

2260
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:18,900
Will there be a future or will there be a future

2261
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,800
It gives us the use of water resources

2262
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,500
brought a big big impact

2263
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:27,300
Then we faced this extreme situation

2264
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,400
it doesn't rain it's drought

2265
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,200
When it rains, it rains again

2266
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,200
what should we do

2267
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,700
Then we actually have to start figuring out a way

2268
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:41,100
Recently, the New Taipei City Government and the Pingtung County Government

2269
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:44,000
are starting to promote the so-called sponge eco-city

2270
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,900
The sponge ecological city is Professor Liu Zhongming

2271
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,700
Like some industries, they are promoting

2272
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:52,400
He made all roads into permeable roads

2273
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,100
when it rains heavily

2274
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:57,000
turned into a factory facility to allow it to counterbalance

2275
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,400
when it's not raining

2276
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,100
these this

2277
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,080
The water born under the road is our natural reservoir

2278
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:06,440
If you say that we put this permeable road

2279
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:07,440
only one meter

2280
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,280
Then the water permeability is only 30%

2281
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,880
if our six degrees tongtong zone does

2282
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,080
we increase the storage capacity of more than one whole reservoir

2283
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,240
So the benefits it brings are very, very high

2284
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,080
even better is

2285
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:20,600
It also has a cooling effect at high temperatures

2286
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,880
let's make our city it's not so hot

2287
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,280
It also soothes us when the temperature is high

2288
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,880
This is what we need to do in the future

2289
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,240
we need to turn our homes

2290
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:32,080
Let our country start to reduce redness towards these disaster prevention in the future

2291
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:36,640
There is also the direction of high temperature resistance to strive to promote

2292
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,680
our election is over

2293
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,720
But we can still tell our representatives

2294
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:41,720
our government officials

2295
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:45,840
We must start changing the way our country is built

2296
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:46,840
more importantly

2297
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,120
we must not ignore

2298
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:51,000
Our Taiwan is a congenital earthquake is very frequent

2299
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,720
And where the risk is very high

2300
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,680
Taiwan has so many earthquakes

2301
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:58,360
These are the so-called activity components announced by the government.

2302
01:21:58,360 --> 01:21:59,800
These places tell you

2303
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:00,720
don't live

2304
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:01,280
why

2305
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,280
Because live bomb city is the most dangerous place

2306
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,400
it's a cartoon

2307
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,840
This cartoon tells us that

2308
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,240
before the earthquake

2309
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:08,320
where do you build a house

2310
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,480
you feel good

2311
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,360
But when the earthquake happened

2312
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,920
Although Zhenyang is here

2313
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:16,000
It's actually where the fault leaks that it hurts the most.

2314
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,360
because the crust shifts

2315
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,120
the entire crust on both sides

2316
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,000
Its height difference will be much different

2317
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,680
energy along the fault

2318
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,640
The place where the distribution is cast is the most

2319
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,920
So this place hurts the most

2320
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:28,800
we can take a look

2321
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,800
The last time this build-up earthquake

2322
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:31,840
this is the case

2323
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,320
This is the Wheel Spectrum tomography where it's located

2324
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,440
after it happened

2325
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,200
You can see it's wind source

2326
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,920
where its fault passes

2327
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,600
The building responds to the sound

2328
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,240
If you are buying at this place

2329
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:44,480
There is no way to undo your damage

2330
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,600
This is the Tiny Wind Bridge. It's broken.

2331
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,120
This is Shigang Dam

2332
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,360
it can't exist

2333
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:52,360
such a solid structure

2334
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:55,120
It has no way to resist the fault

2335
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:55,880
let alone us

2336
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,680
so be careful

2337
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,160
Our house must never be built on a fault

2338
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
on top of our three floors

2339
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
how do we know

2340
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
when the earthquake happened

2341
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
What measures are we going to take?

2342
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
The first one we will start ourselves

2343
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Prepare a shelter bag

2344
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Not enough for the elders in our family

2345
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
sound kid

2346
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
and place it in an easily accessible location

2347
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Our secretariat colleague

2348
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
When our luck opened up last year

2349
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I thoughtfully made this emergency for everyone

2350
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
This card from the Refuge Pack

2351
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
it tells us

2352
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
What kind of life support should we prepare

2353
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
medical lighting for emergency

2354
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
advance letter of communication personal

2355
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
usually when you get ready

2356
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
once it happens

2357
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
you won't keep

2358
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
And you gotta know before it happens

2359
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
What should we do after it happens

2360
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
if you didn't get it just now

2361
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
It's ok when we go out later

2362
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Get another copy with our secretariat colleague

2363
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
This is the Zhuang'an Geological Survey Institute of the Ministry of Economic Affairs

2364
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
its a web page

2365
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
in the upper right corner of its web page

2366
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
There is a country's geological regulations and customs

2367
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Integrated query system with geological data

2368
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
You go to this page and open

2369
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,560
Comb your home address in

2370
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,360
you can know your home address

2371
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,080
Are there active faults nearby?

2372
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:05,920
Is there a downhill slope

2373
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,320
Are there any three risks of landslides occurring?

2374
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:12,000
It's actually a really good physical exam

2375
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,320
Tell us if our home is safe

2376
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,480
this is let us

2377
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,120
Our government has integrated all these data

2378
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,720
so that everyone can use

2379
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,600
So you must make good use of it

2380
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,880
If it is not convenient for you to buy a house online

2381
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,560
You just download the software called Di Zero Zero

2382
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:29,960
put it in your phone

2383
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,840
Land zero zero, you just need to put it in the future

2384
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:32,760
when you go to buy a house

2385
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:34,960
You stand right where your building is

2386
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,040
it tells you if there is an active fault nearby

2387
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,280
how far is it

2388
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,360
Will there be a downhill slope?

2389
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,440
will there be something else

2390
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,760
these are for you to tell you

2391
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,320
Technology we can now master

2392
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:54,960
Help us avoid and prepare for these natural disasters

2393
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,560
It's actually very, very important

2394
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,040
So we now say

2395
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:00,000
Our environment has changed a lot

2396
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,400
our risk is very high

2397
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,200
But the technology we have now is unimaginable in the past

2398
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,400
We can use this technology to protect ourselves

2399
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:10,600
Now the recent central seven areas and world digital technology

2400
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:14,300
Another app for earthquake disaster prevention players has been developed

2401
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:17,400
Everyone can download it in your mobile phone

2402
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,000
When downloading when there is an earthquake

2403
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,100
especially during earthquakes

2404
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:22,100
it will tell you where it happened

2405
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:23,200
how big is it

2406
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,400
If it happened in a place far away

2407
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,600
when it happens

2408
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,400
can give us some early warning

2409
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,800
in terms of positive earthquakes

2410
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:38,200
It happened on September 21, 1999 at this Nantou positive time

2411
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,000
21 seconds later

2412
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,600
This destructive shock wave has only come to our Taipei

2413
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:43,800
21 seconds

2414
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,400
You receive it as soon as it happens

2415
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,200
You can do a lot of things in 21 seconds

2416
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:52,200
So don't celebrate

2417
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:56,000
Recently, the Fire Department of the Ministry of Earthquakes also established a Taiwan earthquake network

2418
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,800
So everyone can also go to the anti-seismic network

2419
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,200
It tells us that the computer

2420
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,600
You must do three things well

2421
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,760
The first one must get down

2422
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,600
The second is to find a place to cover early in the morning

2423
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,800
The third must be steady

2424
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:06,800
after the earthquake pot

2425
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,600
Let's move on to the next step

2426
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,200
in kengren.com

2427
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,200
It has vibrations before we do things to prepare

2428
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,000
How do we take refuge when it is confirmed?

2429
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,900
after proof

2430
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:16,200
what should we pay attention to

2431
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,700
even provide rescue

2432
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:18,800
it's all we can do

2433
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:19,800
everyone must go in

2434
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:20,800
then do some

2435
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,600
Download this useful information

2436
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,800
Finally I want to tell you

2437
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,300
you will manage money you will not be poor

2438
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:27,800
you can draw you can't mess

2439
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,200
you are ready you will not be busy

2440
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,200
then i will tell you

2441
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,400
Facing the environmental crisis

2442
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,300
Of course it's scary. There are many challenges.

2443
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:35,600
But if we are ready

2444
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,800
we won't die

2445
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,000
Not only us personally

2446
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Our house is still like this

2447
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,800
Our country is like this

2448
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,200
So in the end I'll tell you

2449
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,800
Seven red brain words, it brings a great impact, very deep

2450
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,600
its impact on our future

2451
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:47,900
is unimaginable

2452
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:50,100
Our Taiwan needs each of us

2453
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:51,800
work together to build it

2454
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,200
make it more complete

2455
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,200
Taiwan will definitely change in the future

2456
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:56,300
we can't stop

2457
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:59,100
But we can be in the process of changing in Taiwan

2458
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,100
make our home

2459
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Dayuan is safer

2460
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:01,920
we are in energy

2461
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,920
Food Sanitation Water quality sources

2462
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,420
Everyone can play a force

2463
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:08,120
No matter what profession you do

2464
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:09,400
you can all in this

2465
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:10,620
do our part

2466
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:11,420
more importantly

2467
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:12,920
Our future land plan

2468
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:13,920
where the embankment was dug

2469
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,800
easy place along the water

2470
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:16,620
place of fault

2471
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:17,620
how can we avoid

2472
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:18,620
how to build

2473
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:20,420
how to plan

2474
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:21,420
all of us now

2475
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:22,920
everyone can think

2476
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:23,920
can work hard

2477
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,420
That's all for my sharing today

2478
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:26,300
Thank you very much everyone

2479
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,420
I also hope to bring you some connections

2480
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,160
i want to drink first

2481
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,040
i don't know how

2482
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,040
I personally think

2483
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:38,960
many friendships

2484
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,260
perhaps

2485
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,920
can absorb more or less

2486
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,140
Then

2487
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:44,600
can also

2488
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,460
do it yourself

2489
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:47,840
That

2490
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,400
we open this now

2491
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:52,920
please

2492
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:53,800
i want to ask a question

2493
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:54,740
that is

2494
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:56,180
pacific ocean

2495
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:57,640
Continental

2496
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:58,540
actually

2497
01:27:58,540 --> 01:27:59,700
pacific ocean

2498
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,620
Antarctic ice melts as temperatures rise

2499
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:08,960
Melting causes sea-level temperatures to rise

2500
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:13,320
Then if we use another principle to deduce

2501
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:18,440
In the 17th century in Taiwan, the temperature should have been very low

2502
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:22,780
So the ice at the north and south poles melts

2503
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:27,400
From these four hundred years, one thing is

2504
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:33,280
Discovery of seawater retreat in port

2505
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:37,900
So in this way, the past few years

2506
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:42,000
Is it possible for us now to let

2507
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,580
Taiwan returned to the temperature dropped to

2508
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:49,420
Let me talk about that first, is it because

2509
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:53,520
Diving in the port and ice in the North and South Poles

2510
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,040
Dissolution is related

2511
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,860
Dissolving causes the water level to drop

2512
01:28:57,860 --> 01:28:59,900
then rise

2513
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,820
Rising temperatures cause sea level water to rise

2514
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:03,840
Is this the principle

2515
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,380
I said you should understand

2516
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:05,880
Thanks

2517
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:07,680
i need to explain

2518
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,240
When Zheng Chenggong landed in Taiwan

2519
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:11,520
At that time, it was the small soldier flag

2520
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,340
Taiwan's climate is colder than ours today

2521
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:16,120
It will snow in winter

2522
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,400
like we are now

2523
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,700
But after these 400 years

2524
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:20,220
The influence of our braining

2525
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:21,240
we have started

2526
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,800
It is completely different from Zheng Chenggong's era

2527
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,860
At that time our Taiwan was like Kyoto today

2528
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:28,160
Now our Taiwan is like Manila in the past

2529
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,240
In the future we will be like this Jakarta

2530
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:33,020
So in this warming process

2531
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:35,080
Sea level is actually rising gradually

2532
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:36,860
You just said that in dry mouth

2533
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:39,160
we see this water level it has some changes

2534
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:40,960
some places will drop this

2535
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,280
That has something to do with the changes in this area

2536
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,280
what else

2537
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:47,620
with our alpine one

2538
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:48,880
Chongshi related

2539
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,420
let us western plains

2540
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:52,480
Its achievements are getting wider and wider

2541
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:55,040
But now the situation has started to reverse

2542
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,840
with this sea level

2543
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:59,100
rapid rise in warming

2544
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,720
Achievements that Takayama has enriched

2545
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:05,920
Can't keep up with the rate of sea level rise

2546
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:09,200
So the sea level will start flooding in the future

2547
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:13,200
In fact, our current Yanchao Station

2548
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,280
Our record of real cool tests

2549
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:17,520
Kaohsiung Port is now a year

2550
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,000
What is the rate at which its seawater rises

2551
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,200
0.7 cm

2552
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,600
The 0.4 cm we just saw

2553
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,400
Our Kaohsiung is 0.7 cm

2554
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,000
Hsinchu cloth 1 cm

2555
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,560
1 year now

2556
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,880
Penghu is 1.7 cm

2557
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:33,800
This is the Yanchao station we use now

2558
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:37,640
The observed rate of sea level rise

2559
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,560
So what I'm saying is

2560
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,000
when warming

2561
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
When the edge of the two levels disappears

2562
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,840
Global sea levels will rise

2563
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,640
Our Taiwan is in a rising sea level

2564
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:48,440
relatively high place

2565
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:51,080
In the past, the climate will be cold or warm

2566
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:54,320
But this cyclical change is now gone

2567
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,960
We only have one way now

2568
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,440
and it's getting faster

2569
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,000
So looking at the long-term trend

2570
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,600
The situation we are facing is completely different from the past.

2571
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,200
Thank you teacher for your wonderful speech

2572
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:11,520
What I want to ask is this

2573
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,080
In fact, these years

2574
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:18,180
The warming news and scientific reports you talked about today

2575
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:19,460
have heard

2576
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:22,280
But on the other hand, it is also heard that some scholars

2577
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:25,080
They claim they also present scientific evidence

2578
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:27,400
say these things we face today

2579
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,700
It's actually a natural part of the earth.

2580
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:34,300
Instead of really needing to control industry to curb desire

2581
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:35,600
Be able to

2582
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:40,960
Suppressing things, so he said that everyone can continue to develop industries and continue to use energy without worrying

2583
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,240
but

2584
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:46,860
Apparently, we didn't introduce to us today what are the main views of the opposing side.

2585
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:50,940
I don't know the parties, please tell us what their opinions are

2586
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:54,020
Then let's say your opinion is

2587
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:57,340
How to refute their views, thank you

2588
01:31:57,340 --> 01:32:00,100
Go past this Cheo to warm this

2589
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,600
When this issue just happened

2590
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,800
That is, I just got from the institute

2591
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,200
when I just graduated

2592
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,000
back then we said warming

2593
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,700
at a scientific meeting

2594
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:10,600
our reaction

2595
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,400
Only about 5% agree

2596
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,200
We were a minority

2597
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,600
To this day, some people still think that

2598
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,600
warming is an illusion

2599
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,400
it is the natural cycle of the earth

2600
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,900
An important part of natural cycle changes

2601
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:25,700
But the remaining 5% agree

2602
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:28,100
This endorsed has become 95%

2603
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:29,700
I just feel this warming

2604
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:31,300
already a serious problem

2605
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:32,500
it's science

2606
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:33,400
on this topic

2607
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:35,200
we see very different

2608
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,000
I'm on this topic

2609
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,100
It's just over 30 years

2610
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:39,800
I just saw it turn it over

2611
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,000
The second means

2612
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,300
in the history of the earth

2613
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:43,500
we really see

2614
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,500
saw this it was high and low

2615
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:46,500
it has ups and downs

2616
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,000
it has ice periods and warm periods

2617
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,600
like I just showed you

2618
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,100
400,000 years old record

2619
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:52,300
but it has a characteristic

2620
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:53,300
what characteristics

2621
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:54,500
it's all flat

2622
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,000
because of the long-term trend

2623
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
it can go up and down

2624
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,100
But its trend must be flat

2625
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:00,100
it won't have a way

2626
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
But today we see warming is not

2627
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Warming it really has a direction

2628
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
And there is not only one direction

2629
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
It reverses the changes that our planet should have had

2630
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
According to this, now we understand scientifically

2631
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
If it were not for our

2632
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
environmental impact

2633
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
We changed the atmosphere inside

2634
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Concentration of warm oxidation

2635
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
We should now start entering

2636
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
next ice age

2637
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
then our weather today

2638
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
actually better than this

2639
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
It's even colder when it's successful

2640
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,000
to achieve such a situation

2641
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
There is a very basic condition

2642
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
The concentration of warm oxygen in our atmosphere

2643
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
cannot exceed 240 units

2644
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
we can see today

2645
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
During this industrial revolution

2646
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
we are all here

2647
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
almost 280 units

2648
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
at that moment

2649
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
without human influence

2650
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
without us causing so much disruption

2651
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
It will slowly drop from 280

2652
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Then as long as it reaches 240

2653
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
According to our current model

2654
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
we can know that

2655
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
It's starting to enter this next ice age.

2656
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Now we don't have this chance

2657
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
We are now at 400

2658
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
So according to the present earth

2659
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
This accumulated thermal energy

2660
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,720
then it hits

2661
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:04,000
All we can do now is say

2662
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,920
can we do some braking

2663
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,520
What is the warming like today?

2664
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,120
actually like a car

2665
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,520
This car is not on the train tracks

2666
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,880
it is on a hillside

2667
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,720
rush down

2668
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:17,440
Then we are actually doing the brakes now.

2669
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,920
We want the kinetic energy of the car to go down

2670
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:21,880
lower it

2671
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:23,120
even able to stop

2672
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,440
We also hope that one day it can return

2673
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,280
Now we are all here

2674
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:29,200
still in the downhill phase

2675
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,520
So I hope everyone must work together

2676
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:35,200
We let this downhill rate get lower and lower

2677
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,800
And hope one day it can stop

2678
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,160
even reversed

2679
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,960
This almost changes the target to

2680
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:55,280
205 trips reduced to 141 meals

2681
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:58,400
I don't have any expectations at all

2682
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,000
because developing countries

2683
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,840
Absolute need to increase energy use and CO2 emissions

2684
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,120
it is impossible to avoid

2685
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:08,960
Continental from 2000 to 2015

2686
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,280
This adds 5 billion tonnes to emissions

2687
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,840
so like india start today

2688
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,880
I believe between 35 years

2689
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:18,440
India alone will add 5 billion tonnes to emissions

2690
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:19,720
and Southeast Asia

2691
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:21,000
there are other countries

2692
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:21,760
Africa

2693
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:25,840
Unless they stay forever in this inhuman life today

2694
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,640
2.5 billion people in the world each year

2695
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:29,440
Currently lives by hacking

2696
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:30,960
more deaths per year

2697
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:32,240
because of climate respiratory

2698
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:33,840
because chopping leftovers for cooking

2699
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,480
1.5 million more deaths

2700
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,720
these poor countries

2701
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:40,040
They are here in 20 30 years 30 50 years

2702
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:42,840
Must have a lot of energy usage

2703
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,240
and produce more and more carbon dioxide

2704
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,880
Absolutely absolutely impossible to stay at 141 tons

2705
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:50,240
I can tell any of you

2706
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:51,480
I'm certainly alive until 2050

2707
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:54,000
I can agree with our purple grandson

2708
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,640
Impossible at 141t

2709
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:57,760
This is a completely unrealistic goal

2710
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:59,080
and it's inhumane

2711
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,800
Those poor countries call him

2712
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,600
You can't burn briquettes if you chop stubble today

2713
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:04,600
Can't burn kerosene

2714
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,800
You can't ride a motorcycle if you ride a cart

2715
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,200
stay in this situation forever

2716
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:09,800
There may be more than a hundred

2717
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:12,000
This practice is completely inhumane

2718
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:12,800
This is the first one

2719
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,600
The second one was last year

2720
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,800
Because of the current cost of technology

2721
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,200
The technology is quite high

2722
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:21,800
Losses due to natural disasters last year

2723
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:23,400
was the lowest in seven years

2724
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,600
As you should know, it's only 89 billion U.S. dollars

2725
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,400
So although the number of times reaches 1000

2726
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,200
But property damage was the lowest in seven years.

2727
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:37,600
So I think it's okay not to worry too much about these issues.

2728
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,800
Xia Tian said that he has not changed to one meter taller

2729
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:42,200
I think it's probably because I personally think it's impossible to hide

2730
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:46,000
That is 210 years more than one meter

2731
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,600
Maybe a little more, probably can't hide

2732
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:48,600
because we later

2733
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,200
It can be seen that it is always 21 billion to 31 billion

2734
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,400
It is absolutely impossible to have a day of 14 billion

2735
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:55,400
That is to say, it is impossible within fifty years

2736
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,200
absolutely impossible

2737
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:58,000
And it's inhumane to ask me to say it

2738
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,800
you stop forcing those

2739
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,440
A man who cuts his fortune will always cut his fortune, and a man who rides a bicycle will always ride a bicycle

2740
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:04,740
it's impossible

2741
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:07,060
So what we have to do is how to say

2742
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:08,740
It should be said that one meter in the future

2743
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:13,320
In 2000 we rose one meter above the sea

2744
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:14,840
We can also get a good

2745
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:17,280
It's not that big of a deal, like the Dutch ones.

2746
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,600
An average of one meter faster at the beach

2747
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,180
what you should do is rich

2748
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:22,760
do what you should do

2749
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,060
or content coupons

2750
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:25,700
There are various ways to deal with

2751
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:27,380
So the sea is raised by one meter

2752
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:28,820
not a big problem

2753
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:32,020
other extreme changes in climate

2754
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:35,180
We want high mountain areas that are not suitable for people to sweep and rent horses

2755
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:35,900
right

2756
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:37,260
it's impossible

2757
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:39,060
What our earthquake station just said

2758
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:41,620
If it is above the seismic station, of course the house should not be built.

2759
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:43,620
So this is what we want to emphasize

2760
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,620
But let me emphasize one more thing

2761
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:49,220
141 tons to Master 2 in 2050

2762
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:52,160
Absolutely absolutely absolutely will not bear to do it

2763
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:52,920
Thanks

2764
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:56,320
This mentions two points

2765
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,800
I am very careful

2766
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,800
and also very important

2767
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,940
The first one is the amount of soup we will drain in the future.

2768
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:04,440
Will it reach us today

2769
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:07,640
The goals we set at the Paris climate conference

2770
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:10,040
Let's keep our temperature from rising two degrees

2771
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:12,160
It can even be from 1.5 degrees to 1.5 degrees.

2772
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:14,500
Then let our energy saving can reach the target

2773
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:17,660
Then with the existing technology, the existing politics

2774
01:38:17,660 --> 01:38:19,500
their mode of operation

2775
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,840
We all say it's an impossible task

2776
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,500
In fact, this is ignoring us humans

2777
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,340
willing to sacrifice this

2778
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:29,880
You all know that we humans are like ordinary animals

2779
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:31,380
The difference is

2780
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:33,000
we can change ourselves

2781
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,100
That is the game theory I just mentioned

2782
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:37,540
What is the biggest point of Game Theory?

2783
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:39,180
you have to put yourself down first

2784
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:40,340
willing to sacrifice

2785
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:42,700
then this is paris river will it be able to pass

2786
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:44,900
More than 100 countries around the world can

2787
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:46,300
can reach a consensus

2788
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:48,600
The most important thing is that everyone is willing to compromise

2789
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:49,540
willing to back down

2790
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:51,940
Compromise and retreat is just the beginning

2791
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:54,180
It may be difficult at first

2792
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:55,980
But as soon as it starts

2793
01:38:56,020 --> 01:38:58,540
it can go in this powerful direction

2794
01:38:58,540 --> 01:38:59,340
keep moving

2795
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:00,140
so i don't think

2796
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,460
think it's an impossibility

2797
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:03,660
it's a tough

2798
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:05,260
it's a very difficult goal

2799
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:06,660
but not an impossible

2800
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:07,460
The first is to say

2801
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:08,700
We must strengthen the common good

2802
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:10,260
Just like this gentleman said

2803
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:12,760
If we only think about ourselves

2804
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:13,860
do not consider others

2805
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:15,060
this won't work

2806
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:16,260
We must first consider people

2807
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:18,000
just like these

2808
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,160
those poor countries

2809
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,300
if we could reach out

2810
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:22,560
we would like to help him

2811
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,260
there is hope for this

2812
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:27,860
And this requires us to pay a price and sacrifice

2813
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:30,660
The second is to say

2814
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:31,520
after warming

2815
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:34,720
The amount of our losses will be reduced

2816
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:37,120
Looks like the number of natural disasters

2817
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:38,020
Asymmetrical

2818
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:39,020
There is actually a reason for this

2819
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:40,020
what is the reason

2820
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:41,360
because we are ready

2821
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,020
when we are ready

2822
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:45,220
Our damage will actually be reduced

2823
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:46,320
very very many

2824
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:47,520
Also an earthquake

2825
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,560
Happened in Haiti only scale period

2826
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:51,820
It caused more than hundreds of thousands of casualties

2827
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:53,920
But there was an earthquake in Chile

2828
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,460
It scales over 8

2829
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:57,060
is more than 30 times that of

2830
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:59,520
But it killed only a few hundred people

2831
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,400
with not ready

2832
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:04,300
It's the difference between good and bad construction

2833
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:06,000
So today we just want to say

2834
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,100
We wish to say that these rich and powerful countries

2835
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:09,600
well developed country

2836
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,100
be able to sacrifice a little more

2837
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,600
Then help these weak nations rise together

2838
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,200
then our country

2839
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:19,200
There is hope in our world

2840
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,700
that's what i mean

2841
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:23,100
This requires each of us to work hard

2842
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:23,800
you can see

2843
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:25,800
For example, we have a city bureau in Taiwan

2844
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,100
This city bureau is here

2845
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:28,600
Not the City Bureau of Kaohsiung

2846
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:31,900
It's the city bureau in Taitung

2847
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:35,200
Then it's just a vegetable seller

2848
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,000
its impact

2849
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:40,200
can surpass many of us

2850
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:41,200
What's this

2851
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:43,500
is that it is willing to sacrifice

2852
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:47,300
I think the greatest hope of our humanity today

2853
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:48,300
right here

2854
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:49,800
that's what i wish to say

2855
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
first of all of us

2856
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
we need to know

2857
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,700
It's actually today that we see this climate change

2858
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:57,100
It changes the future of our planet

2859
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:58,300
changed our lives

2860
01:40:58,300 --> 01:40:59,700
it's like we got

2861
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Cancer is not necessarily a terminal illness

2862
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Come to cancer he will become terminally ill

2863
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
First we don't face him

2864
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Second we don't treat him

2865
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
The third one we don't change ourselves

2866
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
so i wish to say

2867
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,000
through a share like this

2868
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I hope you all recognize our

2869
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
very challenging

2870
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
our difficulty

2871
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
but we don't despair

2872
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
if we give up

2873
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
is despair

2874
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
if we don't want to give up

2875
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
we are willing to sacrifice

2876
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
we are willing to reach out

2877
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
we still have hope

2878
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
let's treat him

2879
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
we change ourselves

2880
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
we don't think it's impossible

2881
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
today you can see say

2882
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
if we emit carbon

2883
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
so low

2884
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
of course it is possible

2885
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
our energy

2886
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
If new energy can be produced

2887
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
There are new efficiencies

2888
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
we really can

2889
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
achieve this goal

2890
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
This is my personal optimistic view

2891
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
so i think say

2892
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Changes in our humanity

2893
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
In fact, not only can

2894
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
let's get there

2895
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
have a different future

2896
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
ask the director

2897
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Hello everyone

2898
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
My surname is Guo

2899
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I'm going to ask a side question first

2900
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Have you learned about Amitou Buddha

2901
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
this is not chinese

2902
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
not Chinese

2903
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I'm christian

2904
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
I am god

2905
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I'm asking this

2906
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
I will act first

2907
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
I watch TVBS TV with a few minutes of introduction

2908
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
like you go to japan to flood

2909
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
flooded the house

2910
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
people standing on the roof

2911
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
he talks more

2912
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,000
He said that petrochemical leaf is a very greedy industry

2913
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
There is also news in recent days

2914
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Said plastic bags in the ocean in a few years

2915
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
will be as much as fish

2916
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Look at the current situation of the color of the ocean

2917
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
then i have this video

2918
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
I'll ask you again

2919
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:06,260
Units like environmental scientist Lin and Academia Sinica

2920
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:09,460
Like Shida Environmental Pedagogy, as well as religious units

2921
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:14,960
Like Daai TV Station, Mercy Forbidden Society, and Boguang Mountain

2922
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:17,860
Many units pay great attention to the environment

2923
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:20,260
Environmental recycling made a lot of effort

2924
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:23,420
But many units are also consuming a lot of resources

2925
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:27,300
So the effort is wasted

2926
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:30,920
The bottom is not enough to maintain this good environment

2927
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:33,800
The main question I ask is to say

2928
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:39,600
Do you know the American government and politics?

2929
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,300
politics it is for the economic development of the country

2930
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:45,420
Yes, to provide the common people with a moderate life

2931
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:46,520
reduce employment, right?

2932
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,760
This is very important

2933
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:51,200
the problem is to say

2934
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:55,260
Can it be evaluated from a scientific and rational point of view?

2935
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:58,720
How much material resources do ordinary people need for housing and transportation?

2936
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,760
how much to produce

2937
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,000
If there is too much consumption, it is necessary to correct it through education

2938
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:16,000
That is the question I want to ask is whether the governments, politicians, and government officials of various countries can cooperate with environmental science and religious units

2939
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Come to the real world to educate and correct the people's thoughts and life concepts, and only then can the real environment be achieved.

2940
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Then my last suggestion is that Buddhism has been spread from India to China for more than 2000 years

2941
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Later, so many people in Taiwan also studied Buddhism.

2942
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Let's get back to the topic, shall we?

2943
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,000
I can finish in about a minute

2944
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,000
you talk for five minutes

2945
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Because this is the main problem

2946
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:53,000
In the 1970s, there was a British historian, Dr. Toynbee

2947
01:44:53,000 --> 01:45:00,000
He said that there are only two systems that can solve human problems, social problems, and earth problems in the 2 billion century

2948
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:05,500
It is the education of Confucianism and the second Dacheng Buddhism

2949
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:08,600
So what does Buddhism talk about? It talks about all emptiness

2950
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:11,300
No amount of development

2951
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:12,800
not when people are together

2952
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,500
I think a lot of people are raising their hands

2953
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:18,800
problem first

2954
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:19,800
Is this good?

2955
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:23,400
we can end this speech first

2956
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:27,000
Then if you have any questions, you can stay and I will answer them

2957
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,200
He just started

2958
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,600
ask the director

2959
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:33,300
Just now we saw the whip

2960
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:35,200
I'm wondering if it's in the future

2961
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,700
or come again in 2016

2962
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:39,800
Earthquakes will happen in Taiwan

2963
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:42,400
Because of the impact of climate warming

2964
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,200
Earthquakes will be more frequent

2965
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:48,000
Then the haste of the earthquake will also increase, right?

2966
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:48,700
Thanks

2967
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:52,000
I think that from the past few decades in our

2968
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,300
For this area of ​​development

2969
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:56,900
The number of our earthquakes is increasing

2970
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,300
But of course every year has its ups and downs

2971
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:00,200
Then it scales

2972
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
So if it's a trap, will the trap grow bigger?

2973
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
the world is getting bigger

2974
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Taiwan will also be affected by this

2975
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
But will it happen in 2016

2976
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
we can't say

2977
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
because we can't predict

2978
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Let's just say it tends to look like this

2979
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,000
we must be prepared for this

2980
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
can you say this

2981
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
so many people can leave first

2982
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
i can stay

2983
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Then if there is a problem

2984
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
we can be here

2985
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
i want to ask a little question

2986
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,000
just as said before

2987
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
rain will increase

2988
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
this is a trend

2989
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
then ask

2990
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
like desert areas and arid areas

2991
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Is the rainfall also increasing?

2992
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
or is it more arid

2993
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
this is a very good question

2994
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Academician Liu Shaochen was here last time

2995
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,000
has said that he has been

2996
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
we have two things to say

2997
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
First, the rainfall in global terms

2998
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
We don't see the obvious

2999
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:00,800
it is increasing

3000
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:05,500
Its most important thing is that the rainfall intensity becomes very strong

3001
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:07,200
it gets very extreme

3002
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:11,000
Academician Liu Shaocheng used data from land

3003
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,300
tell us the rain doesn't look like it's increasing

3004
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:15,000
but i just told you

3005
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,300
The humidity inside our Daji City is actually a lot

3006
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:20,200
So the rainfall is actually increasing

3007
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:22,100
It's just that the increase doesn't necessarily happen on land

3008
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:24,000
it may be in the sea

3009
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:29,200
So I can only say that the change of rainfall is difficult to control

3010
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:31,200
Some places increase and some places decrease

3011
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:35,200
But the intensity of rainfall is increasing everywhere

3012
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:42,200
Teacher, thank you for your wonderful speech today

3013
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:45,200
In fact, you told us a very important concept is

3014
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:47,700
This group of global warming is past climate change

3015
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:49,700
It takes tens of thousands of years and thousands of years to reach

3016
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:52,200
Now it may be reached in just a hundred years

3017
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,200
This is what we have to adjust and adapt to

3018
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:55,200
This is our concept today

3019
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:58,200
The most important thing is that I want to ask the teacher a few questions

3020
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:00,200
The first one is what you just said

3021
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Because of the relationship with Global Money

3022
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
So it will make Platonic Dynamic

3023
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
so-called plate dynamics

3024
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
will intensify and cause an earthquake

3025
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
But I don't think so

3026
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
because we have entered

3027
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Because I'm not a researcher in this area

3028
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
So I want to ask the teacher to say

3029
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
When you study that terrestrial dynamics

3030
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Is it because our world has entered into

3031
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
A so-called plate activity cycle

3032
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
And with the so-called Global Money

3033
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Actually it doesn't matter

3034
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
The first question I want to mention is this

3035
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
The second question is about the number of typhoons

3036
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Last time Academician Liu still had that

3037
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
The former teacher Wu Junjie

3038
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,000
When they were talking about the number of typhoons

3039
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
actually they said

3040
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Emmen's theory you have already talked about

3041
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
In fact, there is no substantial increase

3042
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
What about your teacher just now?

3043
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
There is a large increase in the slideshow

3044
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
This is what I think is a bit of Crisis De Mar

3045
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
a problem place

3046
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Or do we have different definitions

3047
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I will say it because you have a degree

3048
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,300
the number of your typhoon

3049
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,600
It's because your intensity definition is different

3050
01:49:04,860 --> 01:49:06,660
will increase or decrease

3051
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:08,200
The third question is

3052
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:11,780
Just now we talked about the rise in the temperature of the sea surface

3053
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:13,820
In fact, we are in the so-called

3054
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:16,640
In the atmosphere, we are talking next to me

3055
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:18,680
But we found that

3056
01:49:18,940 --> 01:49:21,760
Next to Wen Bo me is not where the sea temperature increase is the highest

3057
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:23,560
I want to ask the teacher like this

3058
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:26,120
why is this the case

3059
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:27,140
Okay, thank you

3060
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:29,700
back from the third

3061
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:32,000
Mr. Liu Shaocheng, the third one listed on the market, has already said

3062
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:34,560
Just this increase in sea temperature

3063
01:49:34,820 --> 01:49:36,100
Typhoons may not happen

3064
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:38,140
It also depends on the surrounding atmospheric conditions

3065
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:39,420
For example, the wind cuts a lot

3066
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:42,760
Therefore, the sea temperature condition is only a necessary condition that he must meet.

3067
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:45,060
Basic conditions but not necessarily a typhoon

3068
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:49,420
In the long run, will the typhoon increase our current observation time?

3069
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:50,940
relatively short

3070
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:52,740
so there is no definite answer

3071
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,540
Didn't I just say that

3072
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:55,820
i mean his

3073
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:56,840
possible trend

3074
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:58,620
This is still to be verified

3075
01:49:58,620 --> 01:50:00,100
so i can't say

3076
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,500
Said the typhoon will definitely increase

3077
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:04,000
then strength it can get strong

3078
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,500
like the typhoon we just saw

3079
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:08,500
in terms of energy

3080
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:11,800
what we're accumulating now on the surface

3081
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:14,200
How much is the accumulated energy in English

3082
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:16,100
I can use another number

3083
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:19,000
We just took the earthquake off the coast of Tohoku, Japan

3084
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,200
energy scale

3085
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:22,500
How much energy do we accumulate

3086
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:24,200
More than 500,000

3087
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:26,500
Do you think it will affect our earth?

3088
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:29,000
All Geophysical Dynamic

3089
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,500
Right now our earth science has no answers

3090
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:33,300
Because our observation time is very short now

3091
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:36,200
Our observations are not enough

3092
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:39,100
So we don't have an answer scientifically right now

3093
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:41,300
But so much energy accumulates in this place

3094
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:43,000
you don't need to be precise

3095
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,700
Let's just intuitively say

3096
01:50:44,700 --> 01:50:46,300
we know it must have had an impact

3097
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:48,400
It's just that the impact with this time

3098
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:49,600
it will become more and more obvious

3099
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:52,200
Our answers will also become clearer

3100
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:53,500
just say that in the process

3101
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:56,800
We still need to work hard to resolve

3102
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
where do they really go

3103
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
because I watched a lot

3104
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Yes they will come into their place

3105
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
they will win their place

3106
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
no answer

3107
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
no answer so far

3108
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
And what we see now is all on the outermost surface of the earth

3109
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
It's the atmosphere, the ocean and the very thin crust.

3110
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
The crust is already below 100 kilometers

3111
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
So that's something we can't handle right now

3112
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
hello teacher sorry

3113
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
i want to ask two questions

3114
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
One is that just after I heard

3115
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Knowing that carbon dioxide seems to be responsible for the entire greenhouse effect

3116
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
one main reason

3117
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Then everyone is on the same thinking of carbon dioxide

3118
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Are there any scientific studies that say

3119
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:46,000
For example, we are in addition to consistent carbon dioxide

3120
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
basically think of it as an indoor greenhouse

3121
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Is it possible to say that there is a window on science

3122
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Let nature let the heat of this gas out to outer space

3123
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Is there any research in this area so that we can come from the root

3124
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,680
To reduce the possibility of this happening in HEC

3125
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:05,000
This is the first question

3126
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,040
The second question I just saw

3127
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:07,680
The teacher has a lot of data

3128
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:09,280
In this data

3129
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:12,840
It's all based on data from the past few decades.

3130
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:14,280
But is there another layer

3131
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:17,720
For example, we lock in earthquakes above magnitude 7

3132
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:22,080
But various felt earthquakes below magnitude 7

3133
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,680
These are all the data

3134
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:25,080
Big data is very popular now

3135
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:27,160
Are we ignoring a section of the warning signs?

3136
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:28,400
on science

3137
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:29,400
bring us meaning

3138
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:31,040
very good second question

3139
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:33,000
We are now targeting

3140
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,080
Those who have a direct impact on us at Level 7 or above

3141
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:36,600
Earthquake below magnitude 7

3142
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:39,320
Of course, its energy accumulation cannot be ignored

3143
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:41,080
This we are on science

3144
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:43,520
Can't do it because the scale is too big

3145
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,160
Our data is really not enough

3146
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:47,440
Our observations are also very limited

3147
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:50,200
answer your first question

3148
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:51,960
sorry i need a moment

3149
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:52,800
carbon dioxide

3150
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,240
carbon dioxide you just said

3151
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:56,600
It's actually a very good idea

3152
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:59,080
It's carbon dioxide and we're all one now

3153
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:00,000
hurt us the most

3154
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
But if we can be creative

3155
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,800
and then burn the carbon dioxide back

3156
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:05,760
Even transforming into our creamy Nahua

3157
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:09,260
This is actually a subject that many of us are struggling with

3158
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:10,660
That's actually a very good

3159
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:14,160
The other is that our science uses the thermal energy accumulated on the surface of the earth

3160
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:16,460
be able to have a pipe to get it out

3161
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:19,460
That is impossible with the existing man-made technology

3162
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:23,960
Only like the 311 earthquake that occurred in the northeast of Japan last time

3163
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:26,760
We will actually observe when the earthquake occurs

3164
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:33,760
The thermal energy of the earth's surface can go up to more than 400 kilometers outside the atmosphere

3165
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:36,260
This is what we can observe directly from Humanitarian Satellites

3166
01:53:36,260 --> 01:53:42,260
The energy it releases is something that we humans cannot achieve.

3167
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:45,260
I think this earth is actually it's me tuning

3168
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:48,260
It is through such an earthquake, for example

3169
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:51,260
or other natural disasters that actually release energy

3170
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:54,260
So the higher the energy, the more intense the earth's response

3171
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:56,260
Just like our high fever

3172
01:53:56,260 --> 01:54:00,760
We have to work hard to send this heat energy out

3173
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Our performance is very, very intense and extreme.

3174
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Ask the teacher, I just talked about that

3175
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:15,000
The monkey fault in Taiwan is related to sea level rise

3176
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Where are we going to find information on this?

3177
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
I mean it was released just now

3178
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Can I ask the teacher to send you the materials again?

3179
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,000
OK, the sea level rise is currently non-existent

3180
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
That's because our current Yanchao data is actually very limited.

3181
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
But now there is a software on the Internet

3182
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,000
This software is called a trend of sea level rise

3183
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Then you can just Google it

3184
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
it just tells you

3185
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
It can only say static mock

3186
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Ascent 1 meter 2 meters 5 meters 7 meters

3187
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Which places will be submerged

3188
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
it's just static

3189
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
it can't tell you the future

3190
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
By which year will it rise by how much

3191
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,000
As for the living bomb layer, it's actually very easy.

3192
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
I just mentioned that there are two pages

3193
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,000
A central geological shelf lock

3194
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
One is ground zero zero

3195
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
The central geological shelf locks the information on that webpage

3196
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,000
is very complete

3197
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,600
Then as long as you enter your home address in

3198
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:04,800
it will show you the map

3199
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:09,600
Then the location of active faults can be clearly marked

3200
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:12,400
Then you look at the distance between your home and this active fault

3201
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:15,400
Usually if the distance is more than 100 meters

3202
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:17,400
you can probably rest assured

3203
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:20,400
If you are within this 100 meters

3204
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:21,400
you have to be careful

3205
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:23,200
If unfortunately you happen to be on this active fault

3206
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:24,600
draw the words above that line

3207
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:26,200
I advise you to move now

3208
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:34,400
Thank you Director Wang for your wonderful speech today

3209
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:39,800
Then I also brought you some messages to take home

3210
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:45,000
That is to say, starting from the individual and everyone to take actions to save energy and reduce carbon

3211
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:49,800
Then I just had one talking about this

3212
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:52,200
CO2 emissions impossible

3213
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:54,200
I said it's impossible with current technology

3214
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:57,800
But you can see that many people are working hard today

3215
01:55:57,800 --> 01:55:59,200
we change our

3216
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,800
Lifestyles and communities that are changing energy

3217
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:07,600
If solar energy can really be developed to

3218
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:11,400
It is indeed possible to replace our carbon dioxide

3219
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:14,700
Can't say it's impossible, at least it can improve

3220
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:16,600
don't keep going up

3221
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:18,500
well thank you very much

3222
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:20,500
thank you all
