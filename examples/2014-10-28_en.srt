Yoshio nozawa

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yoshio nozawa

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The Central Research Institute's

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
International Research Center for International Studies

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
will begin.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's welcome Director Wang Yu

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
to give us a round of applause.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Good evening, everyone.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's welcome Director Wang Yu

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Today we are pleased to invite you to our Earth Institute

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This special review researcher Dr. Zhao Feng

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
come talk to us

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Our little friend of the earth, the moon

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
then let me briefly introduce

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Background information of our presenter today

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Dr. Zhao was born in Hualien

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He graduated from the Department of Physics, National Taiwan University.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
after that in san diego

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
UCCNL gets a Ph.D. in Earth Sciences

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's also NASA.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
many years of service

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then in 2006 he

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's because Taiwan is running a space agency

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
undertake a large project

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,860
So we are very happy to have him back

26
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,560
He is also at Chuo University

27
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,300
Before coming to Academia Sinica

28
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,840
He is the Dean of the Faculty of Earth Sciences at Central University

29
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,600
for a few years

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,940
He has been in Academia Sinica for four years

31
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,100
Dr. Zhao's expertise is in Earth and planetary dynamics

32
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,860
gravity

33
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,260
And geophysics, seismology, etc.

34
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:40,160
This is also the research scope of our Earth Institute

35
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,240
he is on earth

36
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,300
he also does

37
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,700
Because of the background I just introduced

38
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,540
He also does space vehicle geosciences

39
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,100
In terms of research, of course, there is no need to drop the order here

40
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,340
But he is invaluable

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,500
Apart from this research

42
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,200
he also for

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,380
I think there is a scientist in China

44
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,500
It is the Chinese version of Scientific American

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,500
Often write Chinese articles there

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,500
Also published a book on the ancient and modern world between heaven and earth

47
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,640
If you are interested in his speech

48
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,380
What we can look forward to in the future is the scientific people

49
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,880
He also often writes

50
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,260
Okay then I'll stop talking nonsense

51
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,880
Please listen carefully to this moon

52
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,880
Is this sound okay?

53
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,420
Can

54
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,560
sure

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,880
Thank you Vice President

56
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,260
Just now the vice president mentioned that those are research expertise

57
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,960
Of course he's really good at storytelling over here.

58
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Today is

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Today is Uncle Zhao telling a story

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Today we're on a meet-the-neighbors tour

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This neighbor is our neighbor

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
moon

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We all know this neighbor

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Every day actually you have the chance to see him

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But thousands of years of human civilization have seen thousands of years

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I really don't know him

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
until recently so to speak

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Only after the development of science did we slowly understand him

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Today I will of course talk in depth

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
things we already know

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But it's really just fur

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
real

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We can really say that we are to our neighbors

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I still don't know

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
let's take a look

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Everyone see me here

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
actually asked a lot of questions

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
i hope i have time

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,960
Can cover these problems

80
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,200
Some questions are not easy to ask

81
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,040
Because really we know so little

82
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,800
This is what we are all familiar with

83
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,600
the moon looks like this

84
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,640
After a whole month's cycle

85
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,760
We can see this before and after

86
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,200
if there is no cloud

87
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,200
It can be said that we only know

88
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,600
only see its ID

89
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,400
we don't really understand it

90
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,600
This can be obtained from

91
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,160
I'll be back here later

92
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,840
Our understanding of the moon from the ancients

93
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,160
you can help it imagine

94
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,560
Really, actually, I feel full

95
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,760
I feel sympathy for the ancients

96
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
they really don't know

97
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,600
what's going on in this world

98
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
then we now think

99
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,400
Primary school textbooks tell us

100
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,840
But the ancients really didn't know

101
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,600
They are the moon that sees the sun

102
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,960
Cycle like this every day for centuries

103
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,920
He really doesn't know what's going on

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,500
The same should be true for the moon

105
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,300
to the ancients

106
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,900
Ours is in the poetry, in the legend

107
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,100
And these cosmology legislation

108
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,200
all have the shadow of the moon

109
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,600
But it's just a superficial impression

110
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,500
So of course this is over

111
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,700
this meeting

112
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,300
another example

113
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,400
For example, in the Yijing

114
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,800
These universal philosophies that everyone is familiar with

115
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,600
two of them

116
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,100
The moon is one of the two instruments of nutrition

117
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,700
This is when we used to try to understand these things

118
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,700
invented some

119
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,600
we know it's not true

120
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,800
not scientifically correct ideas

121
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,900
We are now going to look at it from a scientific point of view

122
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,100
when our neighbor

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The first thing to actually ask is that we just call it the moon.

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
you know it's a ball

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
In fact, I really want to ask why is it a ball?

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Do you think this will be a problem?

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Isn't the earth also a ball?

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Isn't the sun also a ball?

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
yes these things are balls

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Actually, one physics question we can really ask is

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
why is this stuff a ball

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
There's actually a lot of physics behind this.

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I point it out just to say

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
when we really want to understand this neighbor

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We don't even know what it looks like

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
don't know why

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's all taken for granted

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Is it a matter of course?

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
because in the solar system

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
there are many smaller things

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The so-called small these few examples

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
For example, there is a little star

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is a photo taken with a real small spaceship

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,420
or the moon of mars

145
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,120
Mars has two small moons

146
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,000
one of them looks like this

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,120
this is very small

148
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,520
It's about tens of kilometers in size.

149
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,800
Such a thing is really not round.

150
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,520
We say a circle is not a ball

151
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,160
This little thing is really not a ball

152
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,860
That is to say, in Sun Creek

153
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,000
or in this universe

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,920
when something comes together

155
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,560
Only when it is large enough will it become spherical

156
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,400
the moon is big enough

157
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,200
Something about a few hundred kilometers will probably

158
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,360
something this big

159
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,760
It will probably naturally become spherical

160
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,800
The reason behind that is actually very simple

161
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,640
It's the same as water flowing downhill.

162
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,000
lowest failure state

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,240
This is what it means

164
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,200
It has turned into this tree in one fell swoop and the rain comes out

165
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,360
I'm the reason behind this

166
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,320
That is to say you see the sun as a ball

167
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,600
The moon is a ball, the earth and we are also balls

168
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,960
In fact, behind

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
physical reason

170
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
it's just saying

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
point out one

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
things we take for granted

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's not a matter of course

174
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
ok let's move on to some

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
related to the moon

176
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
just on the surface we can

177
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Some interesting phenomena observed

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll go into it later and talk about some comparisons

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
A more in-depth understanding later

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let me tell you one

181
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I want to spend a few minutes on this

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Tell everyone this long-winded

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
our this

184
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The so-called force in life

185
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Whether it is the calendar

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
powerful anyway

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This thing is done in units of years

188
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
we all know

189
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There is a so-called Gregorian calendar

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
There is a so-called lunar calendar

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The Gregorian calendar follows the sun

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
according to the sun

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We are all familiar with this force by now

194
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
is the power of the sun

195
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Something to do with the moon

196
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
nothing

197
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,100
it really doesn't matter at all

198
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,600
For example we are in

199
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,760
This is like the old days

200
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,100
A kind of traditional society will use

201
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,300
one of determination

202
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,140
One way is called two-style solar term

203
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,140
right

204
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,840
I might give you this now

205
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
this self

206
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
ask yourself this

207
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,260
See the second type of solar term

208
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,460
Do you think it's positive or negative?

209
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,160
This is actually going to

210
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,860
Now you have to define what Yang Li is

211
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,360
what is yin force

212
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,660
I'm talking about Yangli now

213
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,260
we usually get that day

214
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,460
The moon force is the yang force

215
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,660
And you know the day is fixed by the sun

216
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,460
right

217
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,660
one day to the next one day to the next

218
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,360
It's natural that it takes a day

219
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,460
use the sun

220
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,060
Does it have nothing to do with the moon?

221
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,560
such a force

222
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,560
Yangli

223
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,360
The second type of solar terms is Yin force

224
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,260
Is it really Yangli?

225
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,160
the answer is

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Because you need to know the function of the 24 solar terms

227
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
it actually puts the sun

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We orbit the sun more than 365 days

229
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Divide that day into 24 parts

230
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Each one is about 15 days more like this

231
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's it

232
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
it divides the year

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This has nothing to do with the moon

234
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
right

235
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Look at these words in these 24 solar terms

236
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
you can also see

237
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's full of temperature effects

238
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The effect of humidity

239
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Effect of sunlight

240
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Relationship to the middle of the sun's orbit

241
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
None of the words have anything to do with the moon

242
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
one more you can know

243
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
In fact, all you know is

244
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
these solar terms

245
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The month and date are the same every year

246
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
it didn't run around

247
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
For example, tomb-sweeping day

248
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
April 4th or 5th

249
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
there is a new day

250
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
because our days have no years

251
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That day beats a little bit

252
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
basically it's the same day

253
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
All these solar term days are on the calendar

254
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's the same day every year

255
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Does this already tell you that this is the Gregorian calendar?

256
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Because the moon doesn't matter, right?

257
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
even if you think about it

258
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What is the purpose of thrift

259
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
actually an agricultural society

260
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He wants to know me every year

261
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
what time do you want to do

262
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
what you do is agriculture

263
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That agriculture has nothing to do with the moon

264
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
right

265
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You have to completely follow the law of the sun

266
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
to farm

267
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
you survive

268
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If you use what moon

269
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Cloudy and sunny

270
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If you plant, do your farming

271
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You'll be almost 20 in a few years

272
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
because the time is wrong

273
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If you look at it from this angle

274
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Calendar

275
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,400
It's Nongli

276
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,700
I'm not wrong, there shouldn't be

277
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,900
Really, if you want to do farming

278
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,100
don't think about the moon

279
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,900
you really have to follow the sun

280
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,600
All these things follow the sun

281
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,200
That is to say, even without the moon

282
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,100
this is still right

283
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,100
So how does this follow

284
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,800
anything to do with the moon

285
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,100
Does it have something to do with sound?

286
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
Absolutely not

287
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,200
So this is Yangli

288
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,000
Then don't we really have something called sound power?

289
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Do you know what Nongli and Yangli are?

290
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,800
Of course we have the so-called sound

291
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,400
Sound itself doesn't really matter.

292
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,000
It's just a fun and a convenience

293
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,800
Do you remember when the moon was full last month

294
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,100
Actually the moon is full again

295
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,900
you just have this

296
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,760
there is such a rule

297
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,860
Actually it's not doing anything

298
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,000
Unless you are some aquatic creature by the sea

299
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,300
to do your life cycles according to the tides and stuff like that

300
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,340
or you don't

301
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,700
appointment has nothing to do with you

302
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
So that's a chestnut

303
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,000
We know of some very conscious

304
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,660
like three verses, right?

305
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,740
that's a chestnut

306
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,060
That's why

307
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,220
you are using the legislation of the chestnut

308
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,560
inside that stand

309
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,420
These chestnuts

310
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,120
You know it's different every year, right?

311
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,320
because it is not chestnut

312
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,360
the ancient people

313
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,600
or now you get

314
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,360
Is there any so-called peasant power?

315
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,160
it is counted in black chestnut

316
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,000
so it becomes saying

317
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,700
The knotter is jumping up and down on that stand

318
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,460
different every year

319
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,160
Because the two stand cannot be combined

320
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,320
Because this is not an integer multiple

321
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,220
you will definitely be jumping around

322
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,220
so this

323
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,220
I put this first

324
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,200
Let me remind you of the role of the moon in this

325
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,900
really so

326
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,300
For example, when we talk about the Lunar New Year

327
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,300
In fact, the word does not seem to be wrong

328
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,700
Is January 1st the lunar year?

329
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,700
Because it's the lunar calendar?

330
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,900
Is the lunar calendar the solar calendar?

331
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,700
When we talk about the lunar year, we actually talk about the lunar year

332
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,700
this is just a thought

333
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,700
There is indeed such a

334
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,100
can be fun

335
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,300
here

336
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,500
We are still looking at some of the moon

337
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,700
some of what we can see

338
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,800
some interesting things on the surface

339
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,000
you will notice this heaven

340
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,900
There are two eyes and a smiley face

341
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,300
Do you remember this day?

342
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,800
Photos taken on December 2, 2008

343
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,700
This is when the sun is going down

344
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,100
Of course it's Crystal

345
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,700
This is the lunar calendar and I ran to this position

346
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,620
That day, this day, this time, here

347
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,920
Isn't it a lot of fun to have a cartoon performance here

348
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,820
let's pay attention

349
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,620
when you see the moon

350
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,820
This is Yueya we saw

351
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,820
because the sun is here

352
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,220
So there's no problem with the light here

353
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,300
In fact, it seems that there are also

354
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,560
The places that are not illuminated are not illuminated

355
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,460
Look closely, there seems to be something

356
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:27,900
right

357
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,100
I'm sure someone has this experience every day.

358
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,320
Take a closer look at the time when the weather is clean

359
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
When you look at Yueya

360
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,820
It seems that the audio and video can also see the whole moon

361
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,320
This is in the photo

362
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,360
Because it can be exposed to light for a longer time

363
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,060
see more clearly

364
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,320
Let me show you another example

365
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,360
This is also in the photo

366
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,200
take longer

367
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,860
It really seems like the sun is shining here

368
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,120
Not here at all

369
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,000
but here it seems

370
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But it's bright anyway

371
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,640
faintly visible

372
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,480
This is a clearer example

373
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,240
this is not the full moon

374
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,840
Sputnik

375
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,520
It was taken from the spaceship

376
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,280
dark side of the moon

377
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,480
This moment is when it shines on the dark side of the moon

378
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,000
That is to say, when the sun actually shines on Naimian

379
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,800
I can actually see it glowing

380
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,400
This is actually

381
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,600
i think a lot

382
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,400
Everyone has this experience

383
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,680
This is actually called a ground photo

384
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,760
is the earth

385
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,000
This is light bouncing several times

386
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,400
The sun shines directly on the bright side of the moon

387
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,480
yes

388
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,880
it can't see this side

389
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,000
But why is this side slightly brighter?

390
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,400
It's the sun's light that shines on the earth

391
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,880
the earth reflects it back

392
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,320
brighten it up

393
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
Then the reflected light

394
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,400
reflected back into your eyes

395
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,000
Or the one seen in the machine

396
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,800
very interesting

397
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Light and shadow have gone several times

398
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,800
I can still vaguely see it

399
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,500
this is not your illusion

400
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,900
is really there

401
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,000
Taiwan has relatively humid air

402
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,400
when you see this phenomenon

403
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400
not many

404
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,300
OK there are still some phenomena

405
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,300
probably more or less familiar

406
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,200
date and time

407
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,700
one thing is very interesting

408
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,600
yes it's a coincidence

409
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,900
It is the moon and the sun in our sky

410
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,200
Of course the sun is big

411
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,400
but the sun is far away

412
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
But to observers on Earth

413
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,200
these two circles

414
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,000
almost as big

415
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
sometimes a little farther a little closer

416
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
will be big

417
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,100
that's basically the same size as it really is

418
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,500
it's a coincidence

419
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,100
That's why if you encounter

420
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,580
Just enough to cover the whole land from the sun

421
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,440
Sometimes the distance is slightly worse

422
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
it will be slightly smaller

423
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,440
more and more more and more real

424
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,940
This is very obvious to tell you this coincidence

425
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,240
At this distance on Earth these two things appear

426
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
It's really as big as a conspiracy

427
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,740
Here is an example

428
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,240
If seen from space

429
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,600
this is earth

430
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,800
This is the astronaut on the International Space Station

431
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Full time of a day captured by a camera

432
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,300
an image on earth

433
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,300
a shadow

434
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,800
In other words, this black lump is the shadow of the moon.

435
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,500
That is to say, the people in this

436
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,300
When I looked up to the sky, I saw this

437
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,500
This is because the earth is also rotating

438
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
The moon is running, the sun is running too

439
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,800
This shadow is of course in the net mother's

440
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
direction is moving fast

441
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,440
So someone at a certain location will see

442
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,940
The moon is here to block the out of tune

443
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,700
that is to say on earth

444
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,740
Who is the person who sees the moon and sun?

445
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,740
people in this strip

446
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,040
I don't know where this is going at this time

447
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,040
Call this strip something like this

448
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,040
people down here look up

449
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,340
then you will see this

450
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,340
This is what we look at from another angle

451
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840
This thing I think everyone compares

452
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,340
In fact, everyone understands

453
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,340
just bring it

454
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,340
recall

455
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,340
OK

456
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,340
This is a fast motion video

457
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,340
that's one month

458
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,340
like this for a month

459
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,340
I miss everyone

460
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,340
It can be said that I have seen too much, right?

461
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But when you slow down, maybe you see something that you don't normally notice

462
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
For example, what was your first feeling when you saw this

463
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Of course, we all understand the ups and downs.

464
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Why does it seem to be dangling?

465
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
this dangling is not it dangling

466
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
because when we were on earth

467
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Did you know it's orbiting the earth?

468
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The orbit around this one is not a circle, it's an earth circle.

469
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's a little earthy round

470
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
This is known to oil lamp mechanics

471
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
If the orbit is round

472
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
How can it be a little slower when you are far away?

473
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Walks a little faster when approached

474
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That is to say, when we look here

475
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The moon is actually sometimes faster and sometimes slower

476
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
then you speed it up

477
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Sometimes I can see a little more of this side

478
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Sometimes I can see a little bit more from the angle

479
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
i shake it together

480
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
just see it like it's dangling

481
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,720
not he shaking

482
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,120
just the way we see it

483
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,200
It's been changing a little bit like this

484
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,960
That's actually the main reason I'm posting this for everyone to see.

485
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,320
not this

486
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,760
but want to ask everyone

487
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,560
what is the most important thing you see

488
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,720
except he is round

489
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,560
we already know he's round

490
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,760
a little wobbly

491
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,560
know him

492
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,000
you know what's most important to you what you see

493
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,600
The most important thing you really see is

494
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,160
where you didn't see

495
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,000
did you notice you didn't see behind him

496
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,360
He is just a face for you to see

497
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,160
He won't let you look behind

498
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,520
this strange thing

499
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,160
You see I brought props

500
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,000
This is our earth

501
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,360
we live up there

502
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,360
Just earn and die

503
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,120
Earn a lap a day

504
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,760
the moon is here

505
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,800
27 days to transfer full circle

506
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,800
Because there is also the relationship between the angle of the moon and the sun

507
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,200
So the sun and the moon move

508
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,300
So more than 27 days is not really the cycle we see

509
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:20,600
We really use the cycle of cloudy and sunny to be 29 and a half days

510
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,800
So there are two kinds of moons

511
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,600
about 30 days about 29 days

512
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,300
Because the average is 29 and a half days

513
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,100
this is not important

514
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,300
it is important to say

515
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,400
this moon is orbiting

516
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,000
It doesn't matter that the earth is spinning on our own

517
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,700
when it is winding

518
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,000
it never showed you the back

519
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
it goes around like this

520
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,900
that's all

521
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:53,100
It seems to say that it is hiding behind you, so don't dig it.

522
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,100
You haven't read it, right?

523
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,400
but someone has seen

524
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,400
This is a new jigsaw puzzle

525
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,700
The back looks like this

526
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,100
I'll come back later

527
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,300
why doesn't he let you see

528
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,300
not him

529
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,900
He looks like this on the back

530
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,700
Actually you just look at this

531
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,900
you can see the front

532
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,500
let's face it

533
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,700
This is called the back

534
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,300
English is called near sides

535
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,500
near face and far side

536
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,900
the far side

537
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,900
In fact, you have already seen this

538
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,900
It's different, right?

539
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,300
There are many reasons behind this

540
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,700
The moon is billions of years old

541
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,700
in this career

542
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,300
These rear impact craters

543
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,700
It's the impact crater for food.

544
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,500
are still well preserved

545
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,100
front of earth

546
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,400
This side of the crater

547
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,900
Many are called by this black

548
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,100
In fact, volcanic rumors

549
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,700
almost covered

550
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,500
why is this

551
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,300
this is another question

552
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,300
this is

553
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,900
There are different theories trying to explain it

554
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,640
But at least we see that's the case

555
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,000
everyone has seen this

556
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,400
How many people have seen this?

557
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,500
There should be 21 people who have seen it

558
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,240
Why did 21 people see who

559
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,640
These people are collectively called Apollo workers.

560
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,800
Because really 1969 all the way to 1972

561
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,600
The American moon landing program is called the Apollo program

562
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,800
do you all know

563
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,340
A total of 7 times

564
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,700
3 people each time

565
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,040
7 times succeeded 6 times

566
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,540
The so-called success is later

567
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,000
2 out of 3 people land on the moon

568
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,440
like walking on it

569
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,640
then pick it up

570
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,400
6 successes

571
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,200
In other words, 12 people walked on the moon

572
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,600
21 people all flew to the moon

573
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,800
flew from behind

574
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,260
he saw it with his own eyes

575
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,040
This is one of the princes

576
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,800
take a picture of him and show us

577
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,640
I said seven times

578
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,000
only succeeded six times

579
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,300
what happened again

580
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,300
That's Apollo 13

581
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,500
A total of seven times from the 11th to the 17th

582
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,940
No. 13 didn't work out

583
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,940
you may remember

584
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,000
have filmed

585
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,800
It's called the Apollo 13 movie.

586
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,300
great worth seeing

587
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,200
He just failed to land on the moon

588
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,900
but he also flew

589
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,600
fly behind to go around

590
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,900
rounded the moon

591
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,400
In the temporary that oxygen level exploded

592
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,700
he can't go on

593
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,300
very delicate

594
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,300
let him bring him back successfully

595
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,200
so that time was

596
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,700
still lucky

597
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,700
let's go back to this one

598
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,800
why doesn't he let you look behind

599
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,100
This is still the two pictures just now

600
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,240
this is special

601
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,200
this is

602
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,240
Of course this color is painted by man

603
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,800
His painting shows that

604
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,200
The third highest and the deep valley

605
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,040
high and low terrain

606
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
moon shape

607
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,040
OK

608
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,880
the thing I just talked about

609
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,880
In fact, such a thing

610
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,280
you see him the same

611
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,180
To describe it is

612
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,480
he has a rotation period

613
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,280
exactly the same as the revolution period

614
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,780
let's say seven days

615
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,780
no matter how many days

616
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,680
he is the same

617
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,780
what does it mean

618
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,280
when he is circling

619
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,180
He only has one face facing the words

620
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,840
when he makes a full circle

621
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,580
He turned around by himself

622
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,180
did you notice

623
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,220
he like this

624
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
is the public transfer circle

625
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
At the same time, this time is the full circle of self-transfer

626
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
these two cycles

627
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
exactly the same time

628
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
For us, for people on earth

629
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
it is a facing earth

630
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
this hasn't said why

631
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
just to tell you

632
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Just described the same phenomenon again

633
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
So my question is

634
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Is this a coincidence

635
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
how could it be such a coincidence

636
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Of course it's not a coincidence

637
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
for example

638
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
the moon to the earth

639
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
if this is jupiter

640
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
jupiter has a bunch of moons

641
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Jupiter has now been calculated to have sixty moons

642
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
a few of them are larger

643
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It's something we've known since the days of Homeoire

644
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
all those moons are like this

645
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
it's all like this

646
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
no matter how close

647
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Far

648
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
it's all like this

649
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,800
don't let you look behind

650
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,100
so it's no coincidence

651
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,200
there must be some reason

652
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,800
of course not

653
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,100
not when gods created the world

654
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,000
he likes it

655
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,800
of course not

656
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,200
but

657
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,800
what is the reason

658
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,100
Here is a very simple diagram

659
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,400
But I know I can't go too deep into it

660
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
But roughly, let me describe to you

661
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,100
The reason behind this is called North Korean friction

662
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,400
There are North Korea and friction

663
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,800
it will end up like this

664
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
and tell you a story

665
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,800
That

666
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,300
The so-called DPRK friction can be described like this

667
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,000
This is our earth this green

668
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,000
This is the middle point is the North Pole

669
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
look like this

670
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,700
let's see from above

671
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,600
we see it this way

672
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,400
isn't the earth spinning

673
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,600
The earth rotates like this

674
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,200
is the farther one is farther away

675
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,840
Normally you can imagine saying

676
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
It would be great if this blue was sea water

677
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
you think of it as sea water

678
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
Normally you would want to say

679
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,840
the moon is here

680
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,340
So the water is sucked up

681
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,340
yes

682
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,840
when the moon works

683
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,840
The sea should have a high tide

684
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,840
On the other side it will actually rise up

685
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
This place is actually far from the moon

686
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
farthest place

687
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,840
How could it also go out high?

688
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,680
This is because of centrifugal force

689
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,680
I won't go into it in particular.

690
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,680
It's sharp and centrifugal

691
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,180
When the two balance

692
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,680
we just one day

693
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,180
there will be two tidal bulges

694
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,180
Do you see what this bulge means?

695
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,180
you are the one who lives on earth

696
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,680
You follow the earth around once a day

697
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,020
the moon is here

698
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,800
When you follow the moon to this place

699
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,700
you'll find this place is now orgasm

700
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,700
highest water level

701
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,600
you keep turning

702
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,000
half a day later you transferred here

703
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,100
You found the water dripping down here again

704
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,100
Then it's high again

705
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:22,800
That is to say, the tide creek rises and falls twice a day

706
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,500
because you are turning

707
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,100
But actually the moon is also slightly within the day

708
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,500
also moved a little

709
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,100
So it's not exactly twice a day

710
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,700
a little over twice a day

711
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,700
that time is

712
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,100
In terms of this phenomenon

713
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:49,100
In fact, it will happen twice in 24 hours, 0510 minutes

714
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,600
Just once every 12 hours and 05 minutes

715
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,400
This is the Chaoxi that we normally know.

716
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,400
Of course there are some other

717
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,800
tidal constellation of its cycle

718
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,240
I think I won't talk about it here

719
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,080
The most important thing about this is this

720
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,480
That means you go to the beach to see

721
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,480
you sit there longer

722
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,680
sit for a long time

723
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,140
you will see the ebb and flow

724
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,980
you can see twice

725
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,240
this is ideal

726
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,880
but it's not

727
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,080
actually kind of weird

728
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,980
in fact you are not

729
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,440
these two blue bumps

730
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,440
is attracted to the moon

731
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,580
fixed this direction

732
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,820
But the earth must rotate underneath

733
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,420
isn't the earth spinning

734
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,380
it must turn

735
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,580
There's friction here

736
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,320
This picture is also fun

737
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,820
This picture is from the Internet when I leaked it

738
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,820
This color is not what I ordered

739
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,580
But when I talk to students

740
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,820
I suddenly found out

741
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:55,820
I'm describing blue, green, friction

742
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,420
it's wired

743
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
people have friction

744
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
when rubbing

745
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
You see you are speaking to the earth

746
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Since there is friction

747
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
He wants to drag him away

748
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
He pulled him more and more

749
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
He tried to pull him away again

750
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
The result is a little bit like a slant

751
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It doesn't matter if it's slanted or not

752
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
anyway there is friction

753
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
When there is friction, you know that energy is being consumed

754
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
In fact we have many of these

755
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
The idea is to say

756
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
use tidal power

757
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
In fact, the principle of tidal power generation

758
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
actually

759
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Turn this friction directly into heat energy

760
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Go through our phone first

761
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
use up

762
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
finally become hot

763
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Let's use it in the middle

764
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
that's where this energy comes from

765
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
In terms of the earth

766
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
turn out

767
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,300
Slower and slower

768
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,600
always look like this

769
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,200
These two are there like brake pads

770
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,900
I'm at the bottom, I insist on turning

771
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,900
Isn't that getting slower and slower?

772
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:11,700
so

773
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,600
Judging by this phenomenon

774
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,300
First

775
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,700
This is tidal friction

776
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,400
It causes a phenomenon called

777
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,700
The earth is turning slower and slower

778
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,400
this

779
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,200
you don't know right

780
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,000
yes

781
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,400
your parents and children

782
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,900
Have your parents talked about it?

783
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,900
days are getting harder

784
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,700
Do you have

785
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,500
the days are getting longer really

786
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,600
how is the day

787
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,100
we are now 24 hours a day

788
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,300
In fact, every day is different

789
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,000
long time watching

790
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,800
Because of this tidal friction phenomenon

791
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,000
you say the number is small

792
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,800
I tell you

793
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,400
I'll show you how small it is

794
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,600
today if say

795
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,300
we are so long today

796
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,000
a hundred years ago

797
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,400
Today should be a little shorter than now, right?

798
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Aren't we turning slower and slower?

799
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,100
So that time will be a little shorter

800
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,000
How short is it?

801
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,300
Only a thousandth of a second short

802
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,300
You say it's nothing

803
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,800
that's all

804
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,200
do i just worry

805
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,600
will i know

806
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,900
you don't have to worry

807
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,200
you won't know

808
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,700
But precision scientific instruments can measure

809
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,900
so what

810
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,600
nothing wrong

811
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,700
ok let's continue the story

812
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,500
Scientific instruments are boring anyway.

813
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,900
Since I think the earth is turning slower and slower

814
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,200
I can't measure it either

815
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,900
I can't go directly

816
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,500
not so accurate

817
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,300
A hundred years ago there were no good clocks

818
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,300
what to do

819
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,400
There are clever ways to find this kind of evidence

820
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,500
this is an interesting rumor

821
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
What about this story?

822
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
For example, this is the earth

823
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
If a certain time over the sun stone

824
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
We just saw that one of those dark shadows

825
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
If it is said that the sun power stone at that time

826
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
The trajectory is like this

827
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
That is to say, in this yellow belt

828
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Everyone will see that day

829
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Sunstone looks like this

830
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
This is a real event

831
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
This is an example of what I'm talking about

832
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
This example is

833
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
136 BC on a certain day

834
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
There should have been a Sunstone

835
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
and there really are

836
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Because this example is inside the records of Babylon

837
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
There was no pen and paper in Babylon

838
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And engraved on that clay tablet

839
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
air pattern paper

840
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
found inside fire pipes

841
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
It is recorded that this day

842
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,600
It really happened that day full time

843
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,200
And that's how it was seen in Babylon

844
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,600
it's his record so what

845
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,200
then we are now saying

846
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,100
I said scientists are so boring

847
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,800
it will be fine

848
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,800
That day has happened this day full time

849
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,200
I now have a way to recover that full-time full-time moon

850
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,200
because we now know the position of the moon to the sun

851
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,700
And I know how it turns

852
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,000
i rewind time

853
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,300
Rewind over 2000 years

854
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,100
use the computer to calculate

855
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,800
Just do the math

856
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,100
Counting to that day more than 2000 years ago

857
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,900
That day the real moon is between the earth and the sun

858
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,300
really full time

859
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,400
but sorry

860
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,500
Babylon can't see that day full time

861
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,900
The place to see should be here

862
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
The barbies are here and they are tired

863
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,800
what will happen

864
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,800
really full time

865
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,300
But people who saw him said he was in the Babi people

866
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,500
We now count back to the computer

867
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,500
impossible

868
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,000
what went wrong

869
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,100
because when we arrive

870
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,600
Use 24 hours a day to turn the earth back

871
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,900
But it's not really 24 hours a day

872
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,900
It used to turn faster

873
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,600
you have to follow that

874
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,100
The length of the day that changes a little bit turns back

875
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,400
When you turn to the day more than 2000 years ago

876
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,600
really that strip goes through the barbies

877
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,900
is so

878
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,300
then we now

879
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,400
This seems to become

880
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,200
records of people at that time

881
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,600
can be used by me now to do

882
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,600
To make a proof is to say

883
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,900
It's true that the earth is turning slower and slower

884
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,100
and slow down

885
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,100
That level is really what I just said

886
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,700
That is from modern experience measurement.

887
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:11,020
This is actually found in the historical records

888
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,420
Evidence that the Earth is growing slower

889
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,920
this is awesome

890
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,620
there is one more strange thing

891
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,220
What I just talked about is thousands of years old

892
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,820
Of course, the earth is not only a few thousand years

893
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,420
Earth is 4.6 billion years old

894
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:32,580
Shouldn't it be turning faster earlier?

895
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:38,380
how do i... is there any way to know

896
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,580
This is another interesting observation

897
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,100
here is an amplifier

898
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,780
Prototype mirror to see

899
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,060
a coral it grows

900
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,460
Are corals living things?

901
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,620
animal president

902
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,140
This kind of coral can still be found

903
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,660
you know how long it is

904
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,780
it is every day

905
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,060
it will secrete a layer

906
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,640
this skeleton

907
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,600
one lap a day

908
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,240
one lap a day

909
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,120
but winter and summer

910
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,600
Secretion varies in width

911
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,680
maybe the temperature is different

912
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,320
so it

913
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,960
I don't know how much winter will be

914
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,200
grow faster

915
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,800
Or it will grow faster in summer

916
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,440
but

917
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,800
its

918
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,760
grow out

919
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,680
between this day

920
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,440
Qualification to this is one year

921
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,080
Qualifying to this is another year

922
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,400
It's another year to qualify for this

923
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,240
How many bars are there in the middle?

924
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,640
you can count

925
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,000
you are under the magnifying glass

926
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,560
Counting under a circular mirror

927
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,040
you don't want to count

928
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,960
just ask your students

929
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,960
public reading birth number

930
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,960
inverse number

931
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,760
you will know

932
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,120
Eh

933
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,520
how many days in a year

934
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,320
can't it

935
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,600
this

936
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,840
This is another example

937
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,600
this is

938
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,360
400 million years ago

939
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,360
one

940
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,560
painted rock specimens

941
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,080
There are many such specimens

942
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,880
different ages

943
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,960
I only ality

944
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,900
Let me show you, 400 million years ago, this is very recent

945
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,400
Because the earth is 4.6 billion years old

946
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,600
This is only less than one-tenth of the recent

947
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,900
four hundred million years

948
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,600
The result of this subordinate is

949
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,100
At that time, there were about 400 days in a year

950
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,600
What does it mean?

951
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,100
We now have three hundred and sixty-five days in a year

952
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,700
At that time there were four hundred days in a year

953
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,000
What's the meaning?

954
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,600
This year, this will not change

955
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,300
It's such a long journey, that's one year

956
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,800
that means

957
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,600
At that time, within a circle of the earth

958
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,600
it spins four hundred times

959
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,400
Now it can only go around three hundred and sixty-five times

960
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,800
this is what it means

961
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,800
That is to say, the rotation was faster at that time

962
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,900
Quite a lot, about 10% faster

963
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,800
so you can, this is another

964
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,820
An evidence left to us by nature says

965
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,380
Look, the earth is turning slower and slower

966
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,960
it is true

967
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,560
this part

968
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,100
Just now the physical reason

969
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,100
The evidence left by this earth

970
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,600
It's the same thing

971
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,200
let's see again

972
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,560
Well, this is good, the earth is turning slower and slower

973
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,220
of course say it again

974
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,420
You will never know in your life

975
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,920
too little difference

976
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,320
But this is not the end of the matter

977
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,620
You should know

978
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,620
If the earth turns slower and slower

979
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:46,420
If you ever read that physics mechanics

980
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,620
you may remember

981
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,620
There's a thing called conservation of foot momentum

982
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,620
this one thing it has

983
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,320
There is a physical quantity called foot momentum

984
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,320
The bigger the momentum of the foot, the better the rotation

985
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
The foot momentum is small and the rotation is slower

986
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
that thing

987
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
that amount won't change

988
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
under the same circumstances

989
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
That is to say

990
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Why is the earth spinning

991
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
this is another question

992
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
students sometimes ask

993
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Teacher, why does the earth rotate?

994
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
why does it keep turning

995
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Actually the answer is very simple

996
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
because it has so much foot momentum

997
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
it can't be lost

998
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
it just has to turn every day

999
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
foot momentum is conservative

1000
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
which means it won't increase

1001
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
will not become less

1002
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
now there is a problem

1003
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
You say it turns slower and slower

1004
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
less foot momentum

1005
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
You said that the foot momentum is not much

1006
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
not less

1007
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
where did it go

1008
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Where did the foot momentum go?

1009
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
this answer

1010
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
foot momentum has run away

1011
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
where did you go

1012
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
the answer is

1013
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Who told me to slow down

1014
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
whoever has to take the momentum

1015
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
who made me slow down

1016
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
moon

1017
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Pottery friction slows me down

1018
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
What about my angular momentum?

1019
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
you have to mature you have to continue to take

1020
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
how to take it is to use

1021
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Force drama, this is physics

1022
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
what was the result

1023
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
The earth is spinning slower and slower

1024
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Angular momentum is getting less and less

1025
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
That angular momentum is indestructible

1026
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
The angular momentum of the arm went to the moon

1027
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
what about the moon

1028
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
That angular momentum is increasing

1029
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
As a result his reaction was

1030
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
he has to turn faster

1031
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Or he was revolving to

1032
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
a little bigger

1033
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
his final reaction

1034
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
turn out

1035
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
so

1036
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
It's not wrong that he's still orbiting the earth

1037
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
But he goes farther and farther

1038
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
sort of like a

1039
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
go out like a spiral

1040
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
further and further

1041
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
This one won't look too bad

1042
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
just slowly away

1043
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
how many

1044
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
how many

1045
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
only so much a year

1046
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,440
Click this much, about four centimeters, that's all.

1047
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,100
then this thing is true

1048
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,300
How dare I say it's true

1049
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,140
Because our mountain was cold

1050
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,840
look how cool

1051
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:16,600
this is awesome

1052
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,440
Is this the face?

1053
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,340
There are now 1 2 3 4 5 on this moon

1054
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,380
5 what have instruments placed on it

1055
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,980
Because at that time the Apollo program had boarded six times

1056
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,680
Put a lot of weird instruments on it every time

1057
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:38,580
besides

1058
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:39,940
two

1059
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,080
There were other trips to the Soviet Union

1060
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,180
No one in the Soviet Union has been there, yes

1061
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,080
and unmanned lunar landers

1062
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:48,880
logged in

1063
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,940
Also let go of the instrument

1064
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,680
There are a group of instrument people who look like this

1065
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,440
something like this

1066
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,840
It is a special reflector

1067
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,640
It's a mirror, but it's the kind

1068
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,000
at right angles to this

1069
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,540
called

1070
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,440
Well, let's call it a reflector.

1071
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,840
What is this for? What are you doing over there?

1072
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,840
are we from earth

1073
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,240
wow this thing

1074
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,240
If I accidentally swing someone else

1075
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,000
do we have it from earth

1076
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,840
made a big telescope

1077
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,040
the telescope probably

1078
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,340
At least one meter in diameter

1079
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,400
be big enough

1080
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,740
just what

1081
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:34,140
Use a telescope to shoot lasers

1082
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,140
send laser

1083
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,060
shot straight to the moon

1084
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,300
Then there are reflectors on the moon

1085
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,200
it puts the mirror

1086
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,900
That laser beam bounces back

1087
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,060
This light, wow, hundreds of thousands of kilometers

1088
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,560
send to receive back

1089
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,900
that time

1090
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,860
The amount of reflection is already very weak, very weak

1091
00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,920
this experiment is really bad

1092
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,400
Do it well but do it successfully

1093
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,800
what do you do

1094
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,400
you are the time back in time

1095
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,200
maybe a few seconds a few seconds

1096
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,100
that can be measured very precisely

1097
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,600
Divide the speed of light by two

1098
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,000
That's the distance

1099
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,100
You measure this year and measure next year

1100
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,400
Measure it next year, measure it if you have nothing to do

1101
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,700
measure ten years

1102
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,100
You find it's getting farther and farther away

1103
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,800
Really, how much is it every year?

1104
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,000
almost that much

1105
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,100
Calculate this with us

1106
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,300
The formula of foot momentum and hand scale is the same

1107
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,700
more and more far away from us

1108
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,600
Every year almost so much now

1109
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,200
so what

1110
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,600
you can't see it, can you?

1111
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,900
Did you see the volume getting smaller and smaller, no?

1112
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,400
That's actually very little

1113
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,900
It seems that there is no need to worry, right?

1114
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,000
not so good

1115
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,840
Look at our earth now

1116
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,840
what about 100 years ago

1117
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,840
100 years ago this became 100

1118
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,840
All right

1119
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,840
a little closer

1120
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,340
Good 100 years I will give you 10,000 years

1121
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,840
OK

1122
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,840
Do you think 10,000 years is not enough to win?

1123
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,840
I give you 1 million years

1124
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,840
Not enough for me to give you 100 million years

1125
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,840
The earth is very old, no problem

1126
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,840
You are not enough to win in 100 million years

1127
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,840
I give you 1 billion years

1128
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:31,180
you go admit it

1129
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,180
billions of years ago

1130
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,680
Wow

1131
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,680
where is the moon

1132
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,680
next to our earth

1133
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,680
what is it

1134
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,680
what does this mean

1135
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,680
What is the moon next to the earth

1136
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,680
What does that mean

1137
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,680
this

1138
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,680
It's not about digestion

1139
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,680
because it's true

1140
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,680
very important one

1141
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,680
results of scientific research

1142
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,680
research this thing

1143
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,680
is the biggest look

1144
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,300
The first person to study this phenomenon

1145
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,900
more than a hundred years ago

1146
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,000
call darwin

1147
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
You say I know Darwin is the theory of evolution

1148
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,500
not him

1149
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,000
is his son

1150
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,000
His son's name is Darwin, of course.

1151
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,000
The man who evolved was Charles Darwin

1152
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
This astronomer's name is George Darwin

1153
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
This is a famous astronomer

1154
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
This is what he came up with

1155
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,500
and calculated

1156
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,500
We're all confirmed now

1157
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:39,500
When he asked the question I just asked

1158
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:44,000
He boldly proposed a concept

1159
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,500
What does it mean when the moon was next to the earth?

1160
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,500
He said how the moon came

1161
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,000
It was thrown by the earth spinning too fast

1162
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
that's ok

1163
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
May I

1164
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
And you also know that the rotation is fast at that time

1165
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
right

1166
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Then it got slower and slower

1167
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
as soon as the situation

1168
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
maybe in the event of some disturbance

1169
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
the whole piece ran away

1170
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
The one that got away is our current moon

1171
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
what's wrong

1172
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
May I

1173
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
When this theory was proposed more than 100 years ago

1174
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
immediately received a lot of attention

1175
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
real

1176
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Wow

1177
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
we understand now

1178
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
and some even say

1179
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
you run away a piece

1180
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
The earth must be missing a piece

1181
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So isn't there a big pull?

1182
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
what is that pull

1183
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
ocean

1184
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
It's too cold, isn't it?

1185
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
look

1186
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Wow

1187
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
this is great

1188
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
a theory like this

1189
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
The moon also understands

1190
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
The ocean also understands

1191
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
this is

1192
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
it's a real thing

1193
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
OK

1194
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
so at that time

1195
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
growth of the moon

1196
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,860
This Kangying, this George Darwin proposed

1197
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,440
It was proposed in 1878

1198
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,140
This theory is nicknamed this

1199
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,760
叫Parenthood theory

1200
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,040
It's parent-child talk

1201
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,840
It means that the moon is the descendant of our earth.

1202
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,960
This is you see my picture is so big and only write this small piece

1203
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,520
what is the reason

1204
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,040
Because there's something underneath, right?

1205
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,680
This is the theory number one of the birth of the moon

1206
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,560
is there number two

1207
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,640
This is number one what I just said

1208
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,240
It's like going to World University, right?

1209
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,680
Of course, some people think it's impossible.

1210
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,000
but this

1211
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,880
not like that

1212
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,120
it was then

1213
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:59,120
When you formed, when the solar system formed, large and small gathered

1214
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,640
I gather here

1215
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,600
Are you the moon or the earth?

1216
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,800
it's also a theory

1217
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,400
there's nothing wrong with that

1218
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,680
This is called, nicknamed "Siblings"

1219
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,320
called sisterhood

1220
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,560
There's another piece over here

1221
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,320
It's theory number two and number three.

1222
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,360
number three is

1223
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,600
it's all modern

1224
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,200
This was a hundred years ago, more than a hundred years ago

1225
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,160
This is what the spouse said

1226
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,080
spouse said

1227
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,040
what is it then

1228
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,640
just look at it

1229
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,960
was captured

1230
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,280
That is to say, our earth was a

1231
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:39,920
bachelor

1232
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,000
I am professional

1233
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,520
what year

1234
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,080
it's all about

1235
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,040
Early days of the solar system, infancy

1236
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,120
There won't be such a big change later

1237
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,920
We accidentally walked a guy nearby

1238
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,640
is the moon

1239
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,800
got sucked into the earth

1240
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,600
It's okay if there's nothing wrong with it

1241
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:07,400
This is theory number three

1242
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,200
Every theory it supports what it says

1243
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,900
must be right in school

1244
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:17,800
It's also possible that it's too impossible

1245
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,700
But you just say

1246
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,600
pei says

1247
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,500
We now think Mars has two small moons

1248
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,800
I just had a photo

1249
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:31,900
That's how the two little moons were caught just now

1250
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:35,000
So this is not to say nonsense.

1251
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,700
it's really possible

1252
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,500
Is it possible in school

1253
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,000
Plus

1254
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,500
At the time of this Lantern Moon

1255
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,200
Every time some rocks come back

1256
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,800
rocks of the moon moved back

1257
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,800
Then draw in the laboratory

1258
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,600
compared with the earth

1259
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,500
It's basically the same as the rocks of the earth.

1260
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,600
But there's always something a little different

1261
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,600
those little ones are different

1262
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Can you use any of these theories to explain

1263
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
The result is almost

1264
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Every theory seems to be right

1265
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
There are also flaws

1266
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Then we can't argue, right?

1267
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Then we will write these three here now

1268
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
You can also be your judge

1269
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
whichever one you like, right?

1270
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
we wait for you to reveal

1271
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
because we now only think

1272
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
It can't be all right, right?

1273
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
then you can now

1274
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
You are the only one like this

1275
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Then I will tell you the answer now

1276
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
the answer is

1277
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
none of above

1278
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
We now think the answer is

1279
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
it came out

1280
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Where did it come from?

1281
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
knocked out

1282
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
what is knocked out

1283
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
this is still

1284
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
this is not a photo

1285
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
This is of course human

1286
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,600
This is also the infancy of the solar system

1287
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:09,740
That is, within the first 100 million years of 4.6 billion years ago

1288
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,640
Isn't it infancy?

1289
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,940
something that happened at that time

1290
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,940
what does it look like

1291
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:22,040
It was at that time that things were still not in order

1292
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,740
It's just that the solar system is not messed up

1293
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,340
everyone has everyone's track

1294
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:28,740
But it hasn't been cleaned yet.

1295
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:33,740
once the earth collided with another guy

1296
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,440
that guy is big enough

1297
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,640
If the earth is so big

1298
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,340
That guy probably

1299
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,780
he is so big

1300
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,440
Mars is big enough

1301
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,140
These two things collided

1302
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,740
Of course it's not the same when we bump into each other

1303
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,340
hit it hard

1304
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:56,040
The whole thing just hits everything into ashes

1305
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,440
This bomb is everywhere

1306
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,940
something knocked out

1307
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Most of the things crashed out and flew all over the sky

1308
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Big back and sucked back

1309
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
right? drop back again

1310
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
still something to get

1311
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Accidentally get more energy

1312
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
run away, run away forever

1313
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
there are many things

1314
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Didn't run away, didn't fall down

1315
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
it had to go around

1316
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
because it also has foot momentum

1317
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
If you have feet, you have to go around

1318
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
It is likely that the earth at that time

1319
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
There is a ring

1320
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
All are the fastest substances

1321
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
like what it is now

1322
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
rage star is like this

1323
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
not saturn

1324
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Doesn't Saturn have rings?

1325
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I guess the earth was like that at that time

1326
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Then what

1327
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
inside the rings of saturn

1328
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
these big and small things

1329
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It has this gravitational force in it

1330
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
slowly inhale

1331
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Doesn't it like to be round in the end?

1332
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
yes big enough

1333
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,160
If it is round enough, it will become the moon, that's not how it came about

1334
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,640
Is this theory over?

1335
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,160
People say it's right, right, right, right?

1336
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,040
You want to prove it, how can such a person prove it?

1337
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,840
It's right for you to talk nonsense like this.

1338
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:22,720
But this is not nonsense now, it has been proven to be broken

1339
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,440
How was it confirmed?

1340
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:29,240
confirmed in the computer

1341
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,240
this was ten years ago

1342
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,240
There are scientists who use computers

1343
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:41,240
The computer is getting bigger and bigger, the ability, this ability

1344
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:44,240
more and more powerful

1345
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:49,240
I am not me, I say scientists

1346
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,240
such a crash event

1347
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,240
Simulate, use a computer to simulate

1348
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,240
Mock doesn't tell him to call someone to draw Kao Dong Tu

1349
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,240
Then draw it like this

1350
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,300
No, let him do the math

1351
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,340
He must base his calculations on

1352
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,740
correct physics

1353
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,740
because it's not easy

1354
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:15,500
All relevant physical aspects of such events

1355
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:19,840
All truths must be written in mathematical formulas

1356
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:23,500
Then give him a two thing and start him banging

1357
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,440
After hitting it, it will become like this

1358
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,900
then what happens

1359
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,600
Look at the last in the computer

1360
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,300
Is it possible to create a moon

1361
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,200
this thing worked

1362
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,100
Since it was successful

1363
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:41,300
Is there anyone going to steal something?

1364
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,900
really can be successful

1365
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:47,400
So the theory is accepted

1366
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,900
This theory was accepted

1367
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:52,000
as we now think

1368
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,600
That's how the moon came about

1369
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,300
that's how it came out

1370
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:00,000
Of course, there are many other problems derived from this.

1371
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,360
For example, maybe you see this and you think

1372
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,960
Yes, that Jupiter

1373
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,500
Isn't Saturn just like this now?

1374
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,300
Then you can ask the next sentence saying

1375
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,600
those Saturn things

1376
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,340
Instead, why didn't it grow into a moon?

1377
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,500
why not

1378
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,300
Why can the earth grow into the moon

1379
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,740
I know this too

1380
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,540
know why

1381
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:20,040
Because Saturn is bigger

1382
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,740
that gravity is very strong

1383
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:25,740
the substance near it

1384
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,240
want to attract each other

1385
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,800
want to be the moon

1386
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,860
It cannot be done in the process of a proto-moon

1387
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:37,400
Because the tidal force is too strong

1388
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,900
If you want to mess with that layer, I'll tear it up

1389
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,660
tidal force will tear it apart

1390
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,460
so it doesn't fit

1391
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,300
I know this too

1392
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:48,160
the earth is so small

1393
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,460
The tidal force is not so fierce

1394
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,360
it is possible to grow a moon

1395
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,860
this is also possible

1396
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,580
what about this theory

1397
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:59,880
by the way

1398
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
some get some unexpected benefits

1399
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,000
For example, I just said

1400
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
stones you brought from karma

1401
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
i'll say something

1402
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
How is it different from the earth

1403
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
then use this theory

1404
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Can you explain those differences?

1405
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
it's not my specialty

1406
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
but the answer is yes

1407
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
there are some interesting

1408
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
conscious

1409
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
for example by-products

1410
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Here I will tell one of them is very interesting

1411
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
this thing is like this

1412
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
This is in our solar system

1413
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I say the tuba members of the family

1414
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
This size is the proportion is correct

1415
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
If the earth is so big

1416
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
There are four older than us

1417
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Just the four outside

1418
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
the outer four

1419
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
The biggest is of course Jupiter

1420
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
then saturn

1421
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Uranus Kaiwang

1422
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
There is also a name that was removed from the list a few years ago

1423
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
The heart is small, don't worry about it

1424
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
The earth is actually only this big

1425
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
look at this

1426
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
this is our planet

1427
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
this is ours

1428
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
this is still our planet

1429
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
This is us, this is what's inside us

1430
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
One is Jingxing

1431
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
about the same size , a little bit smaller than us

1432
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
It doesn't matter, the living star is just that big

1433
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
these are all the moons

1434
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
bigger moon

1435
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
How big is that small moon?

1436
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
There are hundreds of them

1437
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
this is big

1438
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
a whole bunch of these planets

1439
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
family of the moon

1440
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
members line up

1441
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
from largest to second largest

1442
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
the moon is here

1443
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
this one

1444
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
this one

1445
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
these four

1446
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
is famous

1447
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
called galilean moon

1448
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
It's all about Jupiter

1449
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Galileo

1450
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
not binoculars

1451
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,600
time to see it ? also see jupiter

1452
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,640
As a result, I saw four moons, these four

1453
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,840
is large

1454
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,200
OK look

1455
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,540
The moon, all the moons line up like this

1456
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:16,500
our moon is really big

1457
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,540
Although not the biggest

1458
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:20,140
but it's really big

1459
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,100
how about this

1460
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:24,000
look back

1461
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,540
so big

1462
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:31,240
its the moon

1463
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,540
we do

1464
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:34,540
our moon

1465
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:38,540
How did we get such a big moon

1466
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:40,540
our moon is really big

1467
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:42,540
I kid you not

1468
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:43,840
in the end is

1469
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,340
This has always been a problem

1470
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,840
Astronomers have been asking this question too

1471
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,440
Why is our moon so big?

1472
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,340
have no idea

1473
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,340
Now

1474
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,540
Now is this a problem? How big does it grow?

1475
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,100
How old is it?

1476
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,340
it can even be

1477
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:06,640
The one bigger than our earth is fine.

1478
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,400
that is to say we are now

1479
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,840
we live on the small one

1480
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,800
those hearts

1481
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,100
why does it have to be so much smaller than you

1482
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,700
No one stipulated this

1483
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,400
Whatever happens when it hits

1484
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,640
it's big or small

1485
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:24,000
So what if it's quite big now?

1486
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,600
no problem, right?

1487
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,400
Ok, this problem is also solved

1488
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,900
I believe this question is for us

1489
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,600
In fact, very few people actually ask this question.

1490
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,400
right

1491
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,900
Because we have long been used to our moon

1492
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:37,300
I thought the moon in the world should be this big

1493
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:38,800
No la

1494
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,200
OK

1495
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:53,500
Another astronomer or physicist

1496
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,600
Anyway, the puzzling thing is this

1497
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:59,100
You see, the earth is placed like this

1498
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,600
then you call

1499
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,740
So you buy it back and buy it like this

1500
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:06,140
It's not that you shake it when you buy it.

1501
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:07,600
It's like this when I bought it.

1502
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,840
I didn't move it

1503
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:10,640
right

1504
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,400
We all... all one-ball hawks do this, right?

1505
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,600
Why

1506
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,900
Doesn't it look good?

1507
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,540
it's slanted

1508
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:20,640
What is it oblique to?

1509
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,640
that's right

1510
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,040
Then we now call it yellow rice noodles

1511
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:24,740
is the sun

1512
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:27,100
we know which side of the sun

1513
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,900
If the face is flat

1514
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:33,740
Our earth actually rotates in Y direction

1515
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:36,600
Then there's an angle here, right?

1516
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,800
This is called the inclination of the Earth's rotation.

1517
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,340
The angle of 23 and a half degrees

1518
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:46,700
It is because of this angle that 4G is available, right?

1519
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:47,200
think about it

1520
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,800
If it turns like this

1521
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:50,700
until the sun turns like this

1522
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:54,140
There is no 4G here

1523
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,500
4G too

1524
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:58,500
We figured it out after we knew there were these things

1525
01:04:58,500 --> 01:04:59,500
Yes, that's right

1526
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
That's how it came

1527
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
why is it so crooked

1528
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
because of you because

1529
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
According to the theory of our solar system formation

1530
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
is generated like this

1531
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
4.6 billion years ago

1532
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
a big pot

1533
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
a lot of little things

1534
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
everyone is here

1535
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
everyone is going around

1536
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
everyone is turning

1537
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
why turn

1538
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
because when it is generated

1539
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
accidentally assigned a lot of angular momentum

1540
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
what about it

1541
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
had to go around

1542
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
just turn

1543
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
when turning

1544
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
under gravity

1545
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
This is how my tour is already

1546
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
The most stable condition is a flat turn

1547
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
a disc turn

1548
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So the early solar system

1549
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
It's such a big pile of material

1550
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
another plate

1551
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
These things start with each other

1552
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,100
It starts to generate planets due to spiritual power

1553
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,800
little parade what moon

1554
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,200
so formed

1555
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,400
you pay attention when forming

1556
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,300
Every thing that forms is assigned some angle measure

1557
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,900
it's going to turn like this

1558
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,200
so these planets

1559
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,400
on this face

1560
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,100
Everything turns like this

1561
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,500
This is how the revolution works

1562
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,700
small circle like this

1563
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:27,600
big circle like this

1564
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,000
Anyway, it's like this

1565
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,900
It rotates like this

1566
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,300
also in the same direction

1567
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,700
Because it's divided into such an angular measure

1568
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:34,300
what about it

1569
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,600
it just gets better

1570
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,700
Just this sentence

1571
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,200
so it turns like this

1572
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,800
That's a straight turn

1573
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,300
Why is it crooked?

1574
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:43,800
why is it crooked

1575
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,400
Whether it will be crooked or not

1576
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,800
Because the angle it is assigned is a small vector

1577
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,100
It's really the angle

1578
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,600
It's all written down now

1579
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,800
It's pretty well written.

1580
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,200
this has always been a problem

1581
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
so why

1582
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
will slant off

1583
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,100
Then you look at other planets found

1584
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:05,040
Mars is crooked too

1585
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,000
Mars is about the same as us

1586
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,500
Still more than 20 degrees crooked

1587
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:10,500
Well

1588
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,900
other planets

1589
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,100
less crooked

1590
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,900
there is an even stranger

1591
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,000
In fact, it is careful

1592
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,200
it's not crooked

1593
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,700
But it turns like this

1594
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:20,700
turn instead

1595
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,700
it turns very slowly

1596
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,100
but the opposite

1597
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,200
it's even weirder

1598
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,000
I don't know why

1599
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,600
It can't be reversed.

1600
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,700
That is to say, you carefully

1601
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:34,200
The sun comes out from the west

1602
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,200
real

1603
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:39,800
That is to say, these rotations of these planets

1604
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:43,000
Why is it so strange

1605
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,800
The simplest is why our earth is so crooked

1606
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:51,700
Well, it seems that I can answer it now.

1607
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,000
It's just crooked

1608
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Didn't you get hit before?

1609
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
hit it

1610
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
If the shoe is bumped, it will be crooked.

1611
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
that's all

1612
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
how big is that

1613
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
what a powerful one

1614
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
How can this collider bend so much?

1615
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
It seems that this thing is not working

1616
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
this is not enough

1617
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
possibly earlier

1618
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
when there is a larger combination

1619
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Big and small

1620
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
It's crooked when it's messed up

1621
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
that other

1622
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
The core can also be explained like this

1623
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Why does carefulness reverse

1624
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
obviously got hit

1625
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
reverse

1626
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Will it be reversed?

1627
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
that's all

1628
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
this is all

1629
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
ever-great problem

1630
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
But now we put this

1631
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
big collider this

1632
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
concept brought in

1633
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
seems to be able to explain

1634
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
OK, this is what we are talking about about the moon

1635
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
deep

1636
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
we again

1637
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:07,680
It also announced and advertised some human exploration of the moon

1638
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,960
also a story

1639
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,720
we tell stories like this

1640
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:15,120
What I just said has nothing to do with people

1641
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:19,320
Except those recorded at the time of the date

1642
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:20,560
Everything else is natural

1643
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:26,520
It's just that people have a special love for the moon

1644
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,480
did a lot of things

1645
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:35,080
This story can be told from 1958 to 1957

1646
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:39,040
this day october 4th

1647
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,560
It's the day humans enter the space age

1648
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,560
what happened

1649
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,880
the Soviet Union

1650
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,160
this country no longer exists

1651
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:53,040
The Soviet Union launched an artificial miniature

1652
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,840
into orbit

1653
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,840
this is a big deal

1654
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,240
because it's too hard

1655
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,760
Now we find it easy to do

1656
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
it's really hard to do

1657
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
This is the first round in the middle of the cold war

1658
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
It's the camp of the Soviet Union

1659
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
he was the first to enter the orbit of a satellite

1660
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
first his artificial satellite into orbit

1661
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Satellite called Sparknik 1

1662
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
This is a photo of a replica

1663
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
not so big

1664
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
probably only this big

1665
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
this is rough

1666
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
You look like a child's toy now

1667
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
He went into orbit and did nothing

1668
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
It is to play the signal BVV of a tape recorder

1669
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
That's it

1670
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
The ground received that signal

1671
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Wow, this is a great progress for mankind

1672
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
great advance in civilization

1673
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
just at that moment

1674
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
This is humanity entering the space age

1675
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
the back of this

1676
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
lots of questions to ask

1677
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,100
soviet won

1678
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,580
This fact is

1679
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:05,120
is history

1680
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:06,400
Simply put

1681
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,180
that time

1682
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,520
want to enter satellite

1683
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,540
to get into orbit

1684
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,340
you must have powerful rockets

1685
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,380
Where was the mighty rocket at that time

1686
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:17,400
in Germany

1687
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:18,940
How can there be in Germany?

1688
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:19,960
because he fought

1689
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:22,780
When he developed during the 20th World War

1690
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:24,060
Called the V2 rocket

1691
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,140
I don't know the detailed story here.

1692
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:28,940
not too detailed

1693
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:31,260
this is a big war

1694
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,040
at the end

1695
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,340
used by germany to bomb london

1696
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:38,160
Britain was bombed badly

1697
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,460
But soon the war will be over

1698
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:41,740
when it's over

1699
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,540
within a few months

1700
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,320
cold war has begun

1701
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:47,380
the first to enter berlin

1702
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:49,160
soviet red army

1703
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:52,500
Once the Soviet Union entered the Red Army and entered Germany,

1704
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:54,280
all good things

1705
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,560
Already spotted

1706
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,100
block all

1707
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,360
move all back to germany

1708
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,200
Go to the Soviet Union, the rocket power is the most important one

1709
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:08,600
personnel data equipment

1710
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:13,300
All the knowledge is packaged and sent back to the Soviet Union

1711
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:19,700
So later, it entered the humane world and was already in orbit.

1712
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,300
This rocket won't work. It's too small. It needs to be bigger and bigger.

1713
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,400
But no matter what, the Soviet Union has this advantage

1714
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,000
first in orbit

1715
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,800
This is the first round of the Cold War, the Soviet Union has already won

1716
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,300
America lost, but not too much

1717
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:44,000
Because you see this January of the second year

1718
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,600
America also succeeded

1719
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:51,100
Also successfully launched his first artificial satellite

1720
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,500
this photo is very famous

1721
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,300
A photo of a celebration dinner at the White House

1722
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,100
this is not a rocket

1723
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,960
rocket big big big big

1724
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,960
This is the artificial satellite on top of the rocket

1725
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,760
This is what artificial satellites look like

1726
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,640
there is an instrument inside

1727
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:12,100
It is the instrument used by this professor

1728
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:14,340
It's called Van Allen

1729
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:15,900
Have any students heard

1730
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:19,800
Pan Allan radiation belts outside the Earth

1731
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,440
It's made in his laboratory

1732
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,440
of these three

1733
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:27,800
This was an official at the time

1734
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,500
officials no one will remember

1735
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,300
scientists remember

1736
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:36,900
This guy is a legend

1737
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:39,500
His name is Wander von Braun

1738
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,200
got the name

1739
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,200
who is it

1740
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:46,200
is the lead scientist of the V2 rocket.

1741
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,200
big boss of v2 rocket

1742
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:53,300
He was never packed back by the Soviet Union

1743
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:56,800
This is his later

1744
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,700
write in the field like this

1745
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I have always hated the Communist Party

1746
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,360
When the Red Army came in

1747
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,360
He hid in the box

1748
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,860
Does he know the Nazi king?

1749
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,860
he hides first

1750
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,860
In a few months, the U.S. military will come

1751
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:12,860
he ran out

1752
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:14,860
Hey, I'm here, I'm like this

1753
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:18,360
America is like Huo Zhibao

1754
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:21,360
It's not like Huo Zhibao, it's the real Huo Zhibao

1755
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,360
just hurry him up

1756
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:29,100
Li Yu's please come to the United States to do a bigger cause

1757
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,100
That business is called NASA

1758
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:34,100
Is it early NASA

1759
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,100
when it was founded

1760
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:38,100
Can't say the biggest

1761
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:41,100
Largest Engineering in Science

1762
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:44,100
Actually, think about this

1763
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,100
history is weird

1764
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:48,100
he was a nazi

1765
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:50,100
And a high-ranking Nazi

1766
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:52,100
His companions were put to death

1767
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,100
are war criminals

1768
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,100
Either shot or hanged

1769
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:59,100
Not only was he not judged

1770
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,340
It is also very reasonable to invite to the United States to do a bigger cause

1771
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:06,340
look how happy he is

1772
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:08,340
Do you have

1773
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:14,340
This is tantamount to saying that he led the first success here

1774
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:18,340
NASA was established at the end of 1958

1775
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:21,840
The United States felt that we lost the first round

1776
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,840
extremely straight up

1777
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,340
We will use the power of the whole country

1778
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:27,340
Founded NASA

1779
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:29,340
The United States lost the second round

1780
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:32,340
The second round is to send people to orbit

1781
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:34,340
or the Soviet Union

1782
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:38,340
The third round is even bigger. Who landed on the moon?

1783
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:41,340
can go back to the story we tell about the moon

1784
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:46,340
In the third round, both sides watched helplessly to see who would win.

1785
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:48,340
That's not something that can be done every day

1786
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:52,340
who sent a man to the moon first

1787
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:54,340
This is history, you know

1788
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:58,340
1969 US Apollo 1

1789
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:00,340
crashed the moon

1790
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,740
mr armstrong like go down there

1791
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:06,880
That's one small step for me, one giant leap for mankind

1792
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,240
that's the story

1793
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:12,200
The United States has been to the United States seven times in a row

1794
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:13,740
succeeded six times

1795
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:17,080
The USSR failed once

1796
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,240
But he has logged in without anyone

1797
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,580
It's a success

1798
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:22,540
But if you lose, you lose

1799
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,380
Don't say that you seem to lose half, there is no such thing

1800
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:26,880
you just lost

1801
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,880
In 1972

1802
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:31,000
Well

1803
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,800
both sides shouted stop

1804
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:34,300
don't go

1805
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:37,100
The reason is very simple

1806
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:39,500
Aren't we running the 100 meters to see who wins?

1807
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,600
Have you ever seen someone running a 100 meters and still running?

1808
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,800
no

1809
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,200
run until then

1810
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:50,000
Win or lose is clear

1811
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,200
Even if you win, you don't want to run away.

1812
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,400
If you lose, you don't even want to run away.

1813
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,200
The United States just doesn't want to run away.

1814
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,700
America really can't run

1815
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,240
It's a waste of national power

1816
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,380
It's not easy to do this kind of thing

1817
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:06,880
this is very scary

1818
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,880
At that time it was still fighting in Vietnam

1819
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,380
The two ends burn like this

1820
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:16,880
Even though the country has put in all the power of Maoism to do it

1821
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,800
But after doing it, it's really like running a hundred meters

1822
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,500
worn out

1823
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,500
I'm exhausted. Don't do it anymore.

1824
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,500
leave this one

1825
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:30,700
We have been to the moon such a record

1826
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,700
yes

1827
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,200
then want to ask

1828
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,900
why are we going to the moon

1829
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,800
I tell you no one can tell

1830
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,800
you see everything as if

1831
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,800
Going to the moon is so amazing

1832
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,600
It's just to see who wins

1833
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,100
Just run 100 meters

1834
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,500
you really outperformed you are really amazing

1835
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,600
But do you want to ask that question

1836
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,000
why should i run

1837
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,100
just want to win

1838
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,100
What about winning?

1839
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,460
How are you doing?

1840
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,660
It's human psychology like this

1841
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:06,860
So what role does the moon play in this matter?

1842
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:12,460
It's just that I was taken as a goal by you to fight for this

1843
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:15,660
How much science is really done?

1844
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:17,700
a little bit

1845
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:19,660
For example, didn't you use the reflection technique just now?

1846
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:21,860
just now

1847
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:26,860
And this one from Lantern Moon

1848
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:30,020
I'll show you the back of my side first.

1849
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:31,860
Really some achievements

1850
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:33,920
brought back some stones

1851
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,520
It can be analyzed that's right

1852
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:39,820
And there is an earthquake chair left on it

1853
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:42,020
It's not an earthquake, it's a moonquake.

1854
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:44,220
Really very few

1855
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,560
Tiny really has moonquakes

1856
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,820
Isn't the moon dead?

1857
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:49,120
How could it shake?

1858
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,760
This can also be studied

1859
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,920
Guess it's because of the tide

1860
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,820
caused by the earth to its tides

1861
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:58,280
This is a scientific achievement

1862
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,680
but you have to think about it

1863
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
How much effort was spent to follow the mining force, material resources, time, and manpower?

1864
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,800
to do this? certainly not worth it

1865
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,700
so i secretly tell you

1866
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:15,700
Daoyeqiu is not for science or human progress

1867
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,700
It's a cold war to see who wins

1868
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:20,000
By the way did a little science

1869
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,500
so

1870
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:25,300
So is science worth spending so much money on?

1871
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:29,300
It's not worth it for us who do science

1872
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,600
But he didn't say he wants to do science

1873
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,600
is in the international

1874
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:38,300
He wants to be the leader. He's the big brother of the western camp.

1875
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:39,800
he will do these things

1876
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,600
right

1877
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,600
what's right or wrong? it's your judgment

1878
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:51,300
OK, there are some behind this

1879
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:55,200
I can tell you a fun story later

1880
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:59,200
But let's go back to what we were talking about

1881
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
What did you say just now? It hasn't been resolved yet.

1882
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Why is the moon so wet for me

1883
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
not yet

1884
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:14,000
In fact, this truth has just been explained through the earth.

1885
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Isn't our earth being turned slower and slower by its tides?

1886
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
you turn around

1887
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
The earth has tides on it, what's more powerful

1888
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
the earth is so big

1889
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
it's small

1890
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
our tidal influence on it

1891
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
although it has no ocean

1892
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
But tides don't have to be in the water to happen

1893
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
It deserves the same friction as the ground. Squeeze what.

1894
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
still the same friction

1895
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
we are so big it is so small

1896
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
We have a big influence on its tides

1897
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
we'll make it spin slower and slower

1898
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
real

1899
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
What, how strong is it?

1900
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
it stopped turning

1901
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
This can't be called

1902
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
It can't be the lowest energy

1903
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
it can't turn anymore

1904
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
It's called non-rotation

1905
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
The truth is the same

1906
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Our friction with it

1907
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
It's long gone

1908
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
not now

1909
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Don't say that it stopped turning dozens of years ago.

1910
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
so this is not a coincidence

1911
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
it is

1912
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
You can say it's exhausted

1913
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
All the strength has been worn away by you

1914
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
that's all

1915
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
so it's no coincidence

1916
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
So other angry stars and picture stars

1917
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Its moons are all like this

1918
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I don't know it stopped turning decades ago.

1919
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
that's all

1920
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
this is the answer to

1921
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
We just started with that question

1922
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
should be by now

1923
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
many questions just asked

1924
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
already understood

1925
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
ok now we can

1926
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:07,000
So back to a story we told at the end

1927
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:17,000
This is the rocket that was used when the Apollo program was launched

1928
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:23,000
This rocket is called the Saturn V

1929
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
really big enough

1930
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:33,000
This is the largest rocket ever made by mankind

1931
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Not this one, this series needs one every time

1932
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
so big

1933
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:47,000
When I got to that Washington, that's when I served there.

1934
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Every time I go to the US capital horse space museum

1935
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
All the NASA babes go in later

1936
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
great size

1937
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,500
it has a show want to show this thing

1938
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:08,000
At least show you how big this tail is

1939
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
right

1940
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,000
To let you know wow, going to the moon was scary

1941
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
how big is it

1942
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,000
It's too big, so there's no way to exhibit it

1943
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
very smart it looks like this

1944
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
it uses a model

1945
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Just made such a small block

1946
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
then use the mirror

1947
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
a mirror over here a mirror over here

1948
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
wow you go in and see

1949
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
wow it's so big

1950
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
In fact, this small corner

1951
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
very mirror very smart

1952
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
really big big

1953
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Spray fire on this thing to go up like this

1954
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
why are you watching this

1955
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I mean some people say it's a lie, right?

1956
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Do many of you know

1957
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
say someone will say

1958
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
It's a scam, never been there

1959
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Lie to you

1960
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Nope, I've heard of bureaucracy

1961
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
You must have heard of it, right?

1962
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
good

1963
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Then what I want to say is of course

1964
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Of course I've been there, don't be crazy

1965
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Is boring

1966
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
This is the process of middle age

1967
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
For example, this photo is famous

1968
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Just for everyone to see

1969
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Here is this picture called Earthrise

1970
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Sunrise Earthrise

1971
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
nor sunrise

1972
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
not Moonrise

1973
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
rising sun

1974
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
this is the surface of the moon

1975
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
When actually orbiting the moon

1976
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,000
photo taken by the astronaut

1977
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
This is of course

1978
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Boss Aubrey he is the second

1979
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
man on the moon

1980
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
he bowed his head

1981
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
He said the angle of this photo is too important

1982
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
take a snapshot

1983
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,440
it's famous of course

1984
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,640
possibly human

1985
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:08,440
Don't know if the third or fourth footprint

1986
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:12,640
this

1987
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,840
I see too many pictures like this

1988
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:15,740
To be questioned is to say

1989
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:17,240
where is this

1990
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:20,140
this is the set

1991
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:20,940
you are short

1992
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:22,340
You just take a photo on set

1993
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:23,440
help us

1994
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,400
so you've been to the moon like this

1995
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,800
no evidence

1996
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,640
Then I can find a lot of holes

1997
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:31,040
This is obviously something wrong with you

1998
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,080
that's wrong

1999
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,080
otherwise how could

2000
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,880
you can't explain

2001
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,380
obviously you lied

2002
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:38,640
this is what we heard

2003
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,880
This argument

2004
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:42,140
Said that NASA has not actually been there

2005
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:45,140
this is the set

2006
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,580
Of course he told why

2007
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:48,280
this is the set

2008
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,680
I really don't want to repeat

2009
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:53,640
Those concepts that those people say are wrong

2010
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,380
listen to you

2011
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:56,840
because I'm wrong

2012
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,080
why keep emphasizing

2013
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,040
but roughly

2014
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I can suggest some for you

2015
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Obviously you might find something weird

2016
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
For example, it is dark

2017
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
This is clearly under the sun

2018
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
isn't that right, the sun is clearly over there

2019
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
And it's bright, no problem

2020
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
the sun is over there

2021
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Why is the whole day dark

2022
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
It's obviously a scam.

2023
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
No, it's true. It should be black.

2024
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Conversely, if this photo

2025
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
If it's not dark here

2026
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Soon we'll know he's a liar

2027
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
it should be dark

2028
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
am i standing there

2029
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
you see the sun is bright

2030
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Of course it's bright

2031
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
there is no sun

2032
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
how can it be bright over there

2033
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Of course it's black

2034
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
It's not bright, it's black

2035
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
It's black over there too

2036
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Only that is bright, that's all

2037
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Are you saying that this is not our experience?

2038
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Let's go outside during the day

2039
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
The whole sky is bright

2040
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
No, that's the earth, it's weird

2041
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
It's not the moon, it's weird

2042
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,600
What's so strange about the earth? Because it has air

2043
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:08,100
what you see is not the place that is glowing

2044
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:11,360
air scatters sunlight

2045
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,700
become bright in all directions

2046
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:15,200
the whole day is bright

2047
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,600
that is the earth is strange

2048
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,800
This is a function of the atmosphere

2049
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,800
The role of air

2050
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:26,600
Including why the sky is blue

2051
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,100
That's the same reason

2052
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:30,600
It's the details inside

2053
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:32,100
you can analyze it

2054
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:34,500
This was done more than a hundred years ago

2055
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,000
people already know

2056
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,300
This muyu scientist Raly

2057
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:41,400
It's been proven

2058
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,600
So it should be dark this day

2059
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,600
No one dares to say that you are a liar, right?

2060
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,800
innocent is black

2061
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:52,600
It's like using a black cloth behind a black studio

2062
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:57,300
But it was questioned where did the star go?

2063
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:59,700
Isn't there a star?

2064
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Aren't you bright? There should be bright spots

2065
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Where did your bright spot go?

2066
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Apparently your black cloth is too...too...

2067
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Didn't you just drill a few holes and cheat... then you couldn't cheat?

2068
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
No, because it's not easy for you to take pictures of those stars

2069
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Because this is too bright, like the sun, really under the big sun

2070
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
If you take out all the stars

2071
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Your exposure time has long been exceeded

2072
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
throw it all away

2073
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I can't take a photo

2074
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Yes, but I'm sorry, I can't take a picture

2075
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:39,000
In the Ganasa report when they came back

2076
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Many people have said that they see stars behind this photo

2077
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
You can barely see bright spots

2078
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
By the way, that's right

2079
01:28:50,000 --> 01:29:00,000
There is also a very interesting one that can be used as a joke

2080
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
it's called storytelling

2081
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
it is this

2082
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
This was also questioned

2083
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
And why is it like this on your ground?

2084
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
You go to the beach and get some sand rabbits on that set

2085
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
then step on it

2086
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
wow that looks great

2087
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
another lie

2088
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
I'm telling you, I'm not lying

2089
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
I'll tell you later

2090
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Why is it obviously not a lie

2091
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
this world is like this

2092
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
NASA people go before

2093
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
What does this big lunar surface look like?

2094
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
really do not know

2095
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
because from a distance

2096
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
even around

2097
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
you can't see

2098
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
what does the moon look like

2099
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
but does it matter what it looks like

2100
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Very important

2101
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
because you will log in in the future

2102
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
that

2103
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
want

2104
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
thump

2105
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
right

2106
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
that Taiwanese boat

2107
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
This landing craft is about to land

2108
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
if that is hard ground

2109
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
rock

2110
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
wow then you like this

2111
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
thump

2112
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
I really don't want that

2113
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,520
Another is that the feet are not hard

2114
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,940
all it can't get you...no mud

2115
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:06,120
because there is no water

2116
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:07,940
Otherwise it's sand

2117
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:09,120
that's even scarier

2118
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,880
How many feet do you go up like this?

2119
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:13,880
Then it started to sink

2120
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:16,000
That's even scarier, right?

2121
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,880
so this is very important

2122
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,420
not kidding important

2123
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:21,880
is really important

2124
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,640
Then why might it be a hard ground?

2125
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:24,800
It is of course possible

2126
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,200
Because when it was first formed, it was

2127
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:31,200
Rocks were formed four billion years ago.

2128
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:31,960
then what

2129
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:33,680
has he always been a rock

2130
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:35,640
Somebody go weather it into dirt?

2131
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:36,400
No

2132
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,480
Because there is no wind, no water, no air

2133
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,280
it's hard

2134
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:41,880
So that long didn't go before

2135
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:44,720
don't know what the surface looks like

2136
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:46,480
must know

2137
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,520
Because I want someone to go

2138
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:52,880
So let's go to the moon with an unmanned one first.

2139
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,920
I found it good

2140
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:56,720
not hard

2141
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,280
surface is dust

2142
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,920
Not very thick

2143
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,540
wow this is the best

2144
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:05,640
So take the back seat and follow that

2145
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:09,740
That kind of mechanics to do it, no problem, no problem at all

2146
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:12,040
That is to say, the surface of the moon

2147
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,560
really that's it

2148
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:16,380
What is this being questioned?

2149
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:17,920
What's up with the surface of the moon?

2150
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:20,740
why is this

2151
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,320
I don't know why it happened in the early days

2152
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:27,640
Scientists slowly study and think slowly

2153
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,180
later found out that

2154
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:32,760
Since that's the case, let me explain

2155
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:34,820
explained

2156
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,340
Makes sense yes

2157
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:38,660
this surface is

2158
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:40,700
cosmic rays

2159
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,000
An example of solar wind charging

2160
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:44,800
Been fighting for billions of years

2161
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:46,840
It's all powdered

2162
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:49,660
Molecule by molecule for you

2163
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:51,700
That's how it was after the fight

2164
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:55,300
It's not killing, it's not profit, it's like powder

2165
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:59,400
I would just describe him as dust, that's all.

2166
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,540
The surface is really like this

2167
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:07,700
and in that video

2168
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,240
they're happy to go up

2169
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,000
Jumping over there, right?

2170
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:11,640
you have seen

2171
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:14,040
jump up and slowly fall down

2172
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:15,540
Because of the gravity on this

2173
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,040
Only one-sixth of the earth

2174
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,640
Of course you can jump high

2175
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:22,240
Then this one falls very slowly too

2176
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:26,540
If you kick this powder

2177
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:27,500
will definitely kick

2178
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,840
You will also kick when you go up

2179
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,380
i promise you

2180
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:32,800
You can see the gray in the video

2181
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,580
That powder is like this

2182
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:36,440
slow down like this

2183
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:38,380
This is also questioned

2184
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:39,240
why do this

2185
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:42,740
It's like there's air

2186
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:47,080
Actually, what I want to answer is to say

2187
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:49,880
what do you think it should be

2188
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:50,740
as it should be

2189
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:52,640
no air

2190
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:53,440
if you say no

2191
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:54,140
then i know

2192
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:55,880
and you

2193
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,420
I haven't read ordinary physics yet.

2194
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:00,080
many questions

2195
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,840
Actually, it's that kind, it's why it's so strange

2196
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:07,340
It seems different from the earth, so you lie

2197
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:11,200
It's not like that, it's the other way around

2198
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:15,200
That's the truth, please think about it for yourself

2199
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:19,140
Why is this so? After thinking about it, it should be like this

2200
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:22,240
It should be treated like this

2201
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:28,040
Everything is true in the lunar environment

2202
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:34,040
That's right, it's actually not easy to deceive people

2203
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:37,240
You really have to do a scene and do everything

2204
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,540
It's all true, it looks weird

2205
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:44,440
In fact, they are all right. In fact, it is very difficult to do. I won't lie to you.

2206
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:46,940
It's really harder to do

2207
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:56,940
The moon landing started in 1961 when President Lee announced it on TV in public

2208
01:33:56,940 --> 01:34:00,240
Back then even the TV was a blackboard

2209
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,600
announced on tv

2210
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:05,760
我們Before the Coast of the Decade

2211
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,860
before 1970

2212
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:10,860
we're about to put a man on the moon

2213
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:13,060
and bring him back safely

2214
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:16,260
He will announce it to the world

2215
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:19,600
And he's saying I ordered NASA

2216
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,660
Because NASA is the index of the presidential palace

2217
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:26,660
So he made the declaration

2218
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:28,560
At that time, it was still fighting on the moon

2219
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:32,120
when i was working in america

2220
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:35,960
some senior researchers

2221
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,160
we sometimes chat

2222
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:40,560
they'll talk about that time

2223
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:43,160
They also saw it on TV

2224
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:46,420
How does our boss make such a declaration

2225
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:48,360
he's crazy

2226
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:51,120
Do you think that even the computer at that time

2227
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:52,960
nothing special

2228
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,160
there's nothing left

2229
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:55,820
he's crazy

2230
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:59,320
how can we

2231
01:34:59,320 --> 01:34:59,980
NASA

2232
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
only three years old

2233
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
We'll be on the moon in a few years

2234
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
what are you kidding

2235
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
our boss is crazy

2236
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Our senior man said

2237
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
they were at that time

2238
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Just the people in NASA

2239
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
their reaction is this

2240
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
how about you go do it

2241
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
results in less than eight years

2242
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
just landed on the moon

2243
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
this is

2244
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
this you want me to imagine

2245
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
really can't imagine

2246
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
how can it be so powerful

2247
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
real

2248
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
when the power of the country is mobilized

2249
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Wow

2250
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
the spirit of that america

2251
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
really weird and powerful

2252
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
none

2253
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
a nation

2254
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
or a group

2255
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
can do this

2256
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
really weird

2257
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
America is not the first time

2258
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Find a few more years in the 20th World War

2259
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Made it in three years

2260
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
it's hard

2261
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
it's really hard to imagine

2262
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:10,000
But how many years do you think this matter has invested a total of 100,000 people?

2263
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
At that time, there were 100,000 people on Pangda Road

2264
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
There are only 30,000 people now

2265
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
How much money will the country go down

2266
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
mobilize so much force

2267
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
did it and succeeded

2268
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Do you think if this is a lie

2269
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
you want the whole thing to be a lie

2270
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
want to face the truth

2271
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
then fake

2272
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
It can still deceive people on such a large scale

2273
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
the degree of difficulty

2274
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
you might as well go

2275
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
real

2276
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
that is difficult

2277
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
it's not that hard for you to go

2278
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
think from this angle

2279
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
In fact it is true

2280
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I give you another test

2281
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
maybe you know

2282
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
right

2283
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,120
you've been there

2284
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:03,680
this thing

2285
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:06,200
You need to know the meaning behind them

2286
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:09,040
Just run white rice to see who wins

2287
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:11,600
who lost

2288
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:12,920
Soviet Union

2289
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:16,480
People in the Soviet Union never said a word

2290
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:17,520
No

2291
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:22,000
You know you're fake if you lose

2292
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:23,920
Who are you going to lie to?

2293
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:27,160
The Soviet Union is full of experts

2294
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,280
experts among experts

2295
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,680
you got any fake stuff in here

2296
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:34,120
He's not the first to tell you to lie less.

2297
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:36,120
No

2298
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:40,080
Who is now talking about the United States?

2299
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,360
You go and look through those people in the future

2300
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,280
The more he talks the more money he makes

2301
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:47,080
i will lie to you

2302
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:48,960
write more books

2303
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,080
more tv

2304
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:53,840
The whole world invites him everywhere

2305
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:54,680
i will lie to you

2306
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,720
You will know why this kind of thing happens

2307
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,560
If you have ever been deceived

2308
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:06,320
I guess you have enough curiosity

2309
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,100
but sorry

2310
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:10,260
you are curious because you are curious

2311
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:13,760
fact or fact

2312
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:17,520
This matter can be analyzed later

2313
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,860
No matter what angle you say about dry shoes

2314
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:22,520
Is it human long-term love? Look at it from this angle

2315
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:26,760
Don't worry, I've been there

2316
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,760
it's all true

2317
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,460
OK this is the last one

2318
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:36,560
that is to say

2319
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,660
Well, I was there at that time

2320
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:41,760
You know you've been there six times and you've been there at six o'clock

2321
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,960
There are instruments at six points

2322
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:48,260
There is the same path that the car on the moon surface traveled.

2323
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:50,560
There are traces all over

2324
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,220
after decades

2325
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:53,760
are those things still there

2326
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,220
of course in

2327
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:58,520
because there is no wind and rain

2328
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:00,020
what was he like when he left

2329
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,900
It's the same now. It hasn't changed.

2330
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:06,540
Then can we take a sneak peek?

2331
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:07,840
Can

2332
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:11,100
in 2009

2333
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:13,940
The United States sent a purpose not to see

2334
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:15,400
this original scene

2335
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:19,440
It's just some scientific satellites that we really want to explore.

2336
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:23,500
The spaceship is called the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter

2337
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:24,600
just went

2338
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:27,940
Going around is going around without logging in

2339
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:30,140
into my process

2340
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:34,040
Of course those spacecraft have good cameras

2341
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:37,340
Which means NASA, of course, has a schedule

2342
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:40,740
Someday you will fly to our original

2343
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:42,940
Above the login point on the 11th

2344
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:45,640
you take our picture back

2345
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:48,540
Someday you will fly to the position of No. 14

2346
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:49,940
Come back if you take a picture of me

2347
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:53,640
6 dots, 7 dots, all 6 dots are covered

2348
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:54,840
All six points are taken

2349
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:57,240
Here are two examples

2350
01:39:57,340 --> 01:39:59,640
this is

2351
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:00,640
left is

2352
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
11th is the first time

2353
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
over there is number 14

2354
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Can you see a bright spot here

2355
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
the sun comes from here

2356
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
here is a bright spot

2357
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
its shadow is elongated

2358
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,000
This thing is an upright tall thing

2359
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
definitely not natural

2360
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Natural things don't look like this

2361
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
except on earth

2362
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
because when the wind blows and the rain

2363
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
time-lapse of that terrain

2364
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
It's possible to look long

2365
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
That's what happens after erosion

2366
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
normally it grows into

2367
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
don't grow anything like this

2368
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
here has

2369
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
This is the point of the light path

2370
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
and see

2371
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
An upright thing with such a long shadow

2372
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
It's the Luna

2373
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
this is stone town

2374
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
that thing is still there

2375
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Then you're a liar besides this

2376
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
All right

2377
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
This is on the 14th side

2378
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
look carefully

2379
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Can you see there's a

2380
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
There is that trace on this surface

2381
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
this is a spaceship

2382
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,000
space this one will go

2383
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
What is a small car

2384
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
out of the track

2385
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
go put that instrument here

2386
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
there are instruments

2387
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
This shadow is also like this

2388
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
this is current affairs

2389
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
This is over 30 years

2390
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
stay safe

2391
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
really still

2392
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:36,000
There is no need to keep saying this

2393
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
i want now

2394
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
not talking about me

2395
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
what do you want to prove

2396
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
nope

2397
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
I told you back then that I never reacted

2398
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
no public announcement

2399
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
didn't come out and say

2400
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Let me testify

2401
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
we have been there

2402
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
I didn't say a word back then

2403
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
never said

2404
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
It's just that the official didn't say it back.

2405
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
i think it's right

2406
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
casual talk

2407
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
i don't care about you

2408
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
what do you mean

2409
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Really, you ignore him instead

2410
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
not like NASA

2411
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
right

2412
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
I dignified NASA

2413
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I don't care what you say

2414
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
i have it

2415
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I follow these

2416
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
not for

2417
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
to refute you

2418
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
I just want to take pictures

2419
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
How about it

2420
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
I just want to see the situation

2421
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,000
This is the last trace left

2422
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
that's the end of my story

2423
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Because of the moon you all start

2424
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
understand better

2425
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
We humans probably know this too.

2426
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
ok thank you all

2427
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Thank you so much

2428
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
i think we really are

2429
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
one night

2430
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
not talking about night

2431
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Learn more about the moon

2432
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,000
I also heard many stories

2433
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
then we are left

2434
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
about twenty minutes

2435
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
let everyone ask questions

2436
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Doesn't China also have Tibet-Cooperative Moon Exploration?

2437
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
right

2438
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
talk about

2439
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,000
this right

2440
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:24,000
In fact, if we say that this lunar exploration has been very quiet since 1972

2441
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Because what I just said is that there's nothing to go on

2442
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
sooner or later

2443
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Because you are curious about science

2444
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
During the Cold War, Japan actually had

2445
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
These are small satellites

2446
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
even some are for experiments

2447
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
have been there

2448
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
It really only started in the last few years

2449
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
go back and say

2450
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
we're going back to the moon

2451
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
have you heard the slogan

2452
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
that is to say

2453
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,000
It is to do this from the perspective of scientific exploration

2454
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Well, I did make a statistic here.

2455
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,740
But the reason we have it is because it was years ago

2456
01:44:03,740 --> 01:44:06,140
look what's over here

2457
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:09,740
It's not when you read my writing

2458
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:12,800
It was already a few years ago

2459
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,840
Actually quite a lot

2460
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:16,140
Europe also went

2461
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:18,940
Japan went to the United States several times

2462
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:21,240
Including most of China and Russia

2463
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,540
I'm only going for the first time as I write

2464
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:24,580
It's just Chang'e No. 1

2465
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:27,140
Number three should be gone by now, right?

2466
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:29,440
that's gone

2467
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:31,640
haven't landed on the moon yet

2468
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:33,040
go to the moon

2469
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:38,140
But it will be more and more lively in the future, it's true

2470
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:41,740
Even India is going to go

2471
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:45,580
So this moon has become a new one

2472
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:47,540
Not a Cold War target anymore

2473
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:49,040
but

2474
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:53,040
It's probably for the purpose of showing national strength.

2475
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:57,340
But unfortunately it still seems to be a goal

2476
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Let me ask, the bigger the animal on the earth, the magnetic ring it walks on, like an elephant,

2477
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Obviously, there is no way to jump as high as an explosion, or as high as a jumping claw,

2478
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Could it be that the earth used to rotate faster, so it has more centrifugal force,

2479
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Then the moon is on it again, and it is pulling, so the dinosaurs more than 100 million years ago can grow to be so big,

2480
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Then after the dinosaurs died out, it would be better if you couldn’t grow up to be as big as a dinosaur,

2481
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Because the earth rotates relatively slowly now, there is no centrifugal force.

2482
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:40,000
In this way, what you think of this seems to be quite interesting qualitatively,

2483
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:46,000
However, this should not be the case in terms of quantification. That is to say, you just mentioned these phenomena,

2484
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:51,000
We actually understand it, I will describe it a little later,

2485
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:59,000
But the phenomenon you mentioned, in fact, no matter how fast our centrifugal force is on the earth, you actually don’t feel it.

2486
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:05,720
That centrifugal force is now only 1/300 of Wanyou’s profit.

2487
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:07,120
not yet

2488
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:09,040
no matter how fast you earn

2489
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,640
That's like one hundredth

2490
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:13,160
that's going to happen soon

2491
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:16,400
That's like one hundredth of gravity

2492
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:18,040
That's only one hundredth

2493
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:21,360
How big can that grow for animals

2494
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:23,160
that effect is too small

2495
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:27,360
Then you say that the difference between animals is several times

2496
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:28,240
several times

2497
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:30,240
That's only one percent off

2498
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:32,560
It is really

2499
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:33,560
negligible

2500
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,920
So it has nothing to do with that reason

2501
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:37,080
how fast with that

2502
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:38,840
it doesn't matter

2503
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:42,120
Then why did dinosaurs grow so big

2504
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:43,560
We can now also fear

2505
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:46,560
If you bite a dinosaur now, it can be this big

2506
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:49,760
but you'll find it's really slow

2507
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:52,640
Even an elephant can say it's slow

2508
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:55,160
Moves very slowly compared to Jumping Claw

2509
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:59,680
The jumping claw is dozens of times taller than its own body

2510
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Or an elephant, or if you are on the road in a powerful scene, or something with a big road, just jump off

2511
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:13,000
This is not, it has nothing to do with whether the earth rotates or not

2512
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:17,000
This is because under our gravity

2513
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:25,000
The bigger the thing, its volume, for example, you magnify me ten times

2514
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:32,000
My weight has changed a thousand times, but my feet have only grown a hundred times

2515
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,000
This is two-dimensional space, the volume is three-dimensional space

2516
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:41,000
You magnify me ten times, you see I am big, and my feet are a hundred times bigger

2517
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:45,000
But sorry, I'm a thousand times heavier

2518
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:50,000
do you think i can stand still

2519
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,000
So what should I do? Then my legs will be thicker

2520
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,000
It can't be enlarged so thick according to my scale.

2521
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Elephants are like this, you see their legs are so thick

2522
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
seems out of proportion

2523
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
That is to say, you dance him

2524
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Speechless, ask him to zoom in

2525
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
don't say he dances

2526
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
he can't even stand

2527
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
his thin feet

2528
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
so in that movie

2529
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
how to explode

2530
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
mouse so big

2531
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
don't be afraid

2532
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
he won't eat you

2533
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
he can't even stand

2534
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
this is just

2535
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,000
The difference between two tails and three tails

2536
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
There are actually many examples of this

2537
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
we look up at the sky

2538
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
because of the sky

2539
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
this space

2540
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
air this

2541
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Microparticle

2542
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
spectrum turns blue

2543
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
on the night ball

2544
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
see what color it is

2545
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
good question

2546
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,000
We see the blue of the sky is

2547
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
in our big air

2548
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
The solution to scattering sunlight

2549
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:05,000
if you look from the outside

2550
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Actually you can't see the air

2551
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,000
it is transparent

2552
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,000
we are in this because

2553
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
it fan shot

2554
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
it fanned in

2555
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
not outside

2556
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
outside is getting thinner

2557
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
from the outside

2558
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,000
good question

2559
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
when viewed from the outside

2560
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
In fact, the air is transparent

2561
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
no air in sight

2562
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,000
but we can see

2563
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,000
clouds in the air

2564
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
clouds are white water

2565
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
water molecule

2566
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
it's not by fanning

2567
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
it is reflection

2568
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
It's just a group of white clouds

2569
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
elsewhere is

2570
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
If you don't see the land

2571
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
or the sea

2572
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
that's all

2573
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
did not see

2574
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
also can't see what color it should be

2575
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
On the whole

2576
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
our earth

2577
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Nicknamed Blue Planet

2578
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
mean blue planet

2579
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
That blue is not because of the air

2580
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,000
It's the reflection of sea water

2581
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
there is another reason

2582
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
why is the sea blue

2583
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,240
That's another reason, but it's really blue

2584
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:06,240
70% of the earth is water

2585
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:12,280
So the earth as a whole looks like a blue shape from the outside.

2586
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:19,780
Please tell me, you said that the earth is also angry with the moon

2587
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:23,900
This means that the interior of the moon is not solid either.

2588
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:29,840
That's a good question, the moon we think it's something that's cooled

2589
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:34,880
But it is completely solid, why does a solid have friction?

2590
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:38,880
The answer is yes, solids still have friction

2591
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:49,880
Because the energetic society outside is actually pinching and pulling it with images like this

2592
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:53,880
In this molecule and molecule, there is actually a mole-mole movement.

2593
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:57,880
That's how Momo energy is consumed

2594
01:50:57,880 --> 01:50:59,920
So this optical translation is friction

2595
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,000
So don't look at his hard one still inside

2596
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Just now there were earthquakes and moonquakes

2597
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:13,000
are the result of this force

2598
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Ask Professor Zhao

2599
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:25,000
The one who read the report that there was a sign of water found on Mars

2600
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,000
also have air

2601
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,000
So it's a bit similar to the conditions on Earth.

2602
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Very suitable for human migration to Mars

2603
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Ask Professor Zhao for your opinion

2604
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Thanks

2605
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
good question

2606
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,000
But you want me to live, I don't think so

2607
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Because what you said is very suitable is actually just a relative

2608
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Which means he's at least not as hot as the sun

2609
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Or maybe the pressure isn't as great as Jupiter's

2610
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Or maybe he doesn't have that much gravity

2611
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
i can stand up

2612
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,020
It's okay in terms of

2613
01:52:01,020 --> 01:52:04,600
Because Mars is the size of Earth

2614
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:06,400
not too much difference

2615
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,940
so its

2616
01:52:07,940 --> 01:52:10,500
the gravity you are on

2617
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:12,300
smaller than the earth

2618
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:13,560
Great

2619
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:16,640
people go to dream shape

2620
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,680
you can't stand

2621
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:20,740
just go down

2622
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:22,520
that gravity is too much

2623
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:23,300
there are others

2624
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:24,320
it has air

2625
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,340
but sorry for its air

2626
01:52:25,340 --> 01:52:27,640
all carbon dioxide

2627
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:29,700
you can't breathe

2628
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:32,000
its temperature

2629
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,800
kill you

2630
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:34,820
because it is far

2631
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:36,100
and the earth is far away

2632
01:52:36,100 --> 01:52:36,860
and

2633
01:52:36,860 --> 01:52:38,660
Even if it's all carbon dioxide

2634
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:39,180
its

2635
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:40,960
greenhouse effect

2636
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:43,000
only raise it to

2637
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:43,780
Some

2638
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:45,580
still too cold

2639
01:52:45,580 --> 01:52:49,420
Of course the air is only of the earth

2640
01:52:49,420 --> 01:52:51,720
Less than 10%

2641
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:53,500
very thin

2642
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,040
is there any water

2643
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,600
Now there is no liquid water on the surface

2644
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,880
because it's too cold

2645
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,020
it maybe that

2646
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,240
Soil can't be called soil

2647
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:07,200
The weathered sand

2648
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:11,500
Those substances may have frozen moisture in them

2649
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:12,500
might have

2650
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:16,000
In particular, there is a lot of dry ice in the North and South Poles

2651
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
it's cold

2652
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,700
Does that mean it's a good place for people to live?

2653
01:53:21,700 --> 01:53:24,660
In fact, it can be said that you go up

2654
01:53:24,660 --> 01:53:25,800
I don't talk about you

2655
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:29,000
you put a person on it

2656
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,300
He died in three minutes

2657
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:33,700
he can't be hot

2658
01:53:33,700 --> 01:53:35,600
Then you say I want to build something

2659
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:38,500
The airtight environment keeps fire inside

2660
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:39,200
of course you can

2661
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:42,500
then you can also be on the moon

2662
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:43,800
The elite can't come up with it

2663
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:45,800
too hot to kill you

2664
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:48,000
Look at it from your fake angle

2665
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:48,600
Oh well

2666
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:51,200
That Mars is

2667
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:53,800
If you must leave the distance

2668
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:57,000
you choose him, you don't choose anything else

2669
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,800
It's not that he's good, other things are worse

2670
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:13,000
The professor just heard that the earth will turn slower and slower because the power of his feet is absorbed by the moon

2671
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Then there is a question that I didn’t understand just now, why is he always seeing the same side of the moon

2672
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Then why is it because the moon is no longer spinning, so he can see the same side of him

2673
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:34,000
It's not because the power of his feet is absorbed by the moon, why isn't the moon turning faster and faster

2674
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Great question for this question this has a strong physics concept

2675
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I was just secretly wanting to... just... pass the door like this

2676
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:54,000
In fact, this means that the foot momentum is taken away by him, so shouldn’t he turn faster and faster?

2677
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:58,000
If it's fast, it's not... sooner or later I'll see behind him

2678
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
This didn't happen because

2679
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
the shape of the moon

2680
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Has been sucked into a very strange shape by our earth

2681
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,000
It's not that you think it's weird when you see it, it's not weird

2682
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
It still begs for a ball

2683
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
look inside carefully

2684
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,000
it becomes a bit out of shape

2685
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
it faces the earth

2686
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
It turned out to be like the one in Zhongbai

2687
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
this is the lowest one

2688
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
You can say Veen, Gravity Veen

2689
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
its shape has been taken by the earth

2690
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,000
It seems to be frozen

2691
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
so it just

2692
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
when you go around like this

2693
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
it's very comfortable

2694
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Now you have to force it to turn faster

2695
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
In fact, there is another force

2696
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
want to pull it back

2697
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
So now put in an extra effort

2698
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
or Earth's tidal forces

2699
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
please don't turn

2700
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
because you like facing me

2701
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Because this shape already looks like this

2702
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
So its final result is

2703
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
it's still like this

2704
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
But the foot momentum is still there

2705
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
what about it

2706
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:06,000
The result of this balance of forces is that everyone starts to turn in a big circle, just like that

2707
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,000
It is said that NASA has taken photos of aliens, is this really the case?

2708
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Who said NASA ever took pictures of aliens?

2709
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,000
no , you smash that tv

2710
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:38,000
If there is really a TV saying that, you can really sue him for slander or nonsense

2711
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:45,000
So I'm someone who used to be NASA, I want to really blow him up

2712
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:52,000
It's a joke of course, but the point is you don't really don't say anything

2713
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Just do what you say, no, you have to make your own judgment

2714
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
how to judge

2715
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
listen to speeches more

2716
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,000
That nonsense is too much

2717
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
we have one more question ok

2718
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
let him that one

2719
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Hello Professor I have a very curious question

2720
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,000
These are the names you mentioned just now

2721
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Why is it so consistent with the names of the five elements we Chinese talk about?

2722
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
how is this so consistent

2723
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
not this is the same thing

2724
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:35,000
That is to say, we are the same as the ancients

2725
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
now people are the same

2726
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
If you want to find planets in the sky

2727
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
The planets are recognizable

2728
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
because it can run

2729
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
The other stars are always a place

2730
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,000
You can watch it move when you turn it yourself

2731
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,000
But planets relative to other stars

2732
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
it is moving

2733
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
moving so close to me

2734
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:00,000
You can see that its position is moving relative to other stars every day

2735
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:06,480
In fact, in English, the word Planet means a heart that can run

2736
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:10,240
Then let's say translated into planets, it will go

2737
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:16,120
People in ancient times were not called planets, they were called Huo Xing, Huo who was confused

2738
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:19,000
because I really don't know why it moves

2739
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,800
Others are not moving, this fan

2740
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:28,480
Even if we were in history, you are the same now

2741
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:33,120
You go to the sky to find Huo Xing, you can find five

2742
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:35,200
can be seen with the naked eye

2743
01:58:35,200 --> 01:58:39,760
The Chinese people's method is five, well, gold and wood follow Huo Tu

2744
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:44,400
Who? Who is gold, that yellow one is called gold, that gold star

2745
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:48,400
Who is wood, who is fire, that spark is fire

2746
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:50,160
because it's red

2747
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:52,320
Who is the water, the white one

2748
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:56,000
It's Mercury, the other two are Jupiter and Saturn

2749
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:00,160
This is how it came about, because we originally had the concept that gold and wood follow Huo Tu

2750
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,000
and saw five guys in the sky

2751
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Then give him a checkmark

2752
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Then we have the concept of yin and yang

2753
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
that's even better sun moon

2754
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,000
All seven guys got it right

2755
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Then this lived happily for thousands of years

2756
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:22,000
until the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries

2757
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
the telescope is out

2758
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:28,000
see not only five but six and seven

2759
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
There are eight, even the earth is one

2760
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:35,000
So what to do, this is completely broken

2761
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:39,000
It's our original philosophy

2762
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:43,000
This arrangement doesn't actually work

2763
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,000
No, we now know that's not right

2764
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
just a coincidence

2765
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
So those names come from

2766
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
rather than just

2767
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:56,000
you just follow him

2768
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,000
So how do we name the new discovery?

2769
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
i run out

2770
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
just use

2771
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Just use English or what Westerners call you

2772
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
I just translate the meaning

2773
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Urnus is the king of heaven

2774
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Is Nephtune really the god of the sea?

2775
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,000
It's Aquaman

2776
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Is Proctor really that Yama of Hell?

2777
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
It's King Ming

2778
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:23,000
The name came from outside

2779
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Then we originally gave the golden wood decaying European soil

2780
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Foreigners also have these five names

2781
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
They don't call gold, wood and Europe

2782
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
He called this this this this this this

2783
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Then we now say Venus is Vinus

2784
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Mars is Mars

2785
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
it's the same thing

2786
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
that name is different

2787
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
It was different

2788
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
It's almost a process like this

2789
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:52,000
we really enjoyed it tonight

2790
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Everyone go out later

2791
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
At least I saw the moon when I came

2792
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
when you go out to see the moon

2793
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
do you feel different

2794
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,500
Uh uh thanks everyone

2795
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:03,500
Thanks

2796
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:05,000
good teacher
