00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
music

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
applause

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
applause

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
applause

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
applause

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
applause

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,900
Today's Feast of Knowledge

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,500
So first I would like to introduce today's keynote speaker

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,000
Today's speaker is Academician Zhang Zhenghua

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,800
I think everyone should be familiar with his name.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,600
Well, Academician Zhang is a world-renowned archaeologist

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,700
He is the Department of Archaeological Anthropology of National Taiwan University

21
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,500
Graduated from the School of Archeology and Anthropology, National Taiwan University

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,800
yes then graduating from harvard

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,800
So he has actually been from

24
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,700
from his first job

25
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,400
at the Institute of Historical Linguistics at Academia Sinica

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,200
then now as a Distinguished Research Fellow

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,100
His research information is mainly Taiwan

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,200
Realization culture in South China and Southeast Asia

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,200
over the past 40 years

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,100
He has led more than a dozen large-scale projects

31
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,100
large archaeological project

32
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,800
Including the excavation of the very famous Shisanhang ruins

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,300
Archaeological Survey of the Grand Ducey Valley

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Archaeological research on the history of ancient human extension

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Archaeological Research on the North Shore of the Philippines

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But the most interesting thing to draw attention to is the

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
started more than ten years ago

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Nanke Ancient Culture This

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Rescue plan for ruins

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Nananke Ancient Cultural Relics Rescue Project Institute

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Many cultural relics unearthed

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
this

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The importance of academic significance

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
i think it's hard to have

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
comparable to this

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
in 2009

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Mr. Zhang has given many tasks to Taitung County at the Ministry of Culture

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Entrusted the implementation of Taitung Changbing's

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Baxiandong National Site Survey Project

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
that's because of this

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What I'm doing at this time is the director

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Year 2009

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I am the late director

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
so i know all of this

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I have also visited the ruins of Nanke

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I also offered

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,740
Unearthed skeletons of many people across the ages

58
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,940
I forgot whether it was Zhang Xian or who told me

59
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,500
Someday these cars will be brought back to the research institute

60
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,140
I was shocked

61
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,480
Because there is no place in the research institute to put so many

62
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,480
Maybe I don't know if it's Zhang Xian or who was the staff at that time

63
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,440
when joking

64
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,840
because a lot

65
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,740
very large

66
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,900
So Baxiandong Chair

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,240
After four years of intensive and systematic investigation

68
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,140
Determined the chronology and cultural connotation of Taiwan's old culture

69
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,640
Push back the history of human beings living in Taiwan to 30,000 years ago

70
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,240
So this is a very important project

71
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,040
besides

72
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Academician Zhang is also keen on applying archaeology to social services

73
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,740
i think you remember

74
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,240
Last time this TransAsia Airways

75
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,920
Unfortunately, this plane is the best

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
In the end, there was no way Mr. Zhang led the archaeological team

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
with the most sophisticated detectors

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
At that time, the TV interviewed Mr. Zhang

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I have seen

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I think you may have seen

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He often assists the government in carrying out the work of preserving cultural assets

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And from 2002 to 2006

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Curator of the National Taiwan Shijie Culture Museum

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There are many contributions to this Shijie cultural museum

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He also leads the commission of the socio-cultural museum

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Leading the Academia Sinica underwater archeology team

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
There has also now been quite a bit of investigation

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
grades

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Please don't underestimate underwater archeology

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Because at this time I am also the director

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So to train in underwater archaeology

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I want to dive to Ximan in a fast class seaside place in Taoyuan

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The film is very capable of continuing when you and I go to support

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I still remember

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
that was very hard work

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The trainee program

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
that was very hard work

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
so this works

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and it's groundbreaking

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Taiwan did not have such a

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Formal Archaeological Team

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
underwater archeology team

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He also currently serves as

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Chairman of the Chinese Association of Underwater Archaeology

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
promote civil participation

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Protection and promotion of underwater cultural assets

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That Mr. Zhang has a lot of trials

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There are many wind industry crises

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
There is no way to introduce Yiyi here

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The topic he is going to talk about today is

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Stories of Ancient Taiwanese

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
we welcome him with warm applause

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
thank you very much

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Vice President Wang

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Vice President Wang just gave me an introduction

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
actually

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Vice President Wang is my old officer

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
In the past, he was our director when he was in the eleventh institute

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
now our vice president

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So a lot of things he just said

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
under his leadership

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
can be executed smoothly

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
then i personally

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
In fact, time is very fast in this field

125
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,500
It's been 40 years all of a sudden

126
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
this time is very long

127
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,000
Actually in all my work

128
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The last thing that came together was this

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,500
Stories of Ancient Taiwanese

130
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
because of my expertise

131
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Although I also work in surrounding areas of Taiwan

132
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Archeology of Mainland Southeast Asia

133
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,000
But after all, Taiwan is still me

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
main field of work

135
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,000
So in the past 30-40 years

136
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Actually the work I do

137
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The ultimate purpose is to go

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The stories of ancient people in Taiwan

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
able to piece together

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So I bring up this topic today

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I think the story of the ancient Taiwanese

142
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
let me talk for an hour and a half

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Actually, I think that what you say

144
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It should be like a thousand and one nights

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
just tell a story

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Really can add a lot of stories

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But today I can only be very general

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
very simply

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,560
Let's talk about the story of this ancient Taiwanese

150
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,440
Of course, this story is not One Thousand and One Nights.

151
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,120
just one night it won't arrive

152
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,760
Then I say today is easy

153
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,840
if anything is unclear

154
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,800
Also please give me advice

155
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,480
So

156
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,160
My computer here is not very

157
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,560
OK

158
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,080
This is another page

159
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,880
Originally, this mouse should be able to change a page

160
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,520
I don't know why it can't be changed

161
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,560
this can be replaced

162
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,160
this is ok

163
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,480
sorry for this

164
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,720
no page change

165
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,600
here

166
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,960
ok good

167
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,040
then i want this

168
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,440
Before today's story, I will make a beginning

169
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,960
then i want to be in taiwan

170
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,360
One of the most familiar questions is that Taiwanese people

171
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,760
I think everyone in the media is on the news

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Go online and check Google

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,280
This very, very much these discussions

174
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
these discussions these coups

175
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,800
So this Taiwan as a look at all kinds of

176
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,840
the same view

177
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,480
Well in fact there are many

178
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,400
It stems from a different view of history

179
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,520
We can't say who is right and who is wrong

180
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,440
but basically

181
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,760
This is due to many different historical views

182
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,360
Well, I'll just list a few now.

183
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,000
Then the first and most famous is

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,720
Lianheng's Taiwan General Studies

185
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,320
Then this as a view of history

186
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,440
It is basically the historical view of the consciousness of the Han nationality

187
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,440
So from its Taiwan general knowledge sequence

188
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,120
It says Taiwan is not true

189
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,840
Who started it is exactly what made it

190
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,200
Yingzhi in the Qing Dynasty Enlightenment also has a temper

191
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,160
As for more than three hundred years ago

192
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,440
then this obviously

193
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,080
It is a Chinese perspective

194
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,320
such a view of history

195
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,200
that this

196
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,800
Then another very famous

197
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,040
it's totally different

198
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,360
in the opposite direction

199
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,600
This is the famous historical name

200
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,120
It says to write the four hundred years history of Taiwanese

201
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
you see it in front of it

202
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,700
He also said that general laws concerning the development of human society

203
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,200
the universal truth of social development

204
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,800
Combined with these historical realities of Taiwan

205
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,200
Then try to grasp the reality of Taiwan

206
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,000
Re-establish Taiwan's view of history

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So one of his views on history

208
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,200
Basically based on the development of Taiwan's national theory

209
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,000
a view of history developed

210
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,400
What about another historian?

211
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,500
This is the vice president of our college in the past

212
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,000
Where is Vice President Zhang Guangzhe?

213
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,800
Then one of his views on history

214
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,500
so what did he say

215
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,700
He is due to Taiwan's island environment

216
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,500
Complexity of geography and terrain

217
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,000
What about our research on Taiwan history?

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,700
And we must adopt a more obvious perspective of cultural ecology

219
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,000
And because the 2 billion indigenous peoples on Taiwan Island

220
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,900
Therefore, the history of Taiwan contains a very important history of indigenous peoples

221
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,000
The New Components of the Relationship with the Han Dynasty

222
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,800
So he learned from the cultural ecology of an entire island

223
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
such a point of view

224
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
the relationship between the person

225
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,000
This view of human interaction

226
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,100
to develop

227
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
one of his views on history

228
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Another recent one

229
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Cao Yong and Academician Cao who just passed away

230
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Then what he proposed

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Also known as Taiwan Island History View

232
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
so he thinks

233
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Our Research on the Island of Taiwan

234
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
should get rid of these political

235
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
these positions

236
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
some of these politics

237
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Some perspectives on change

238
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Rather, from the history of the people on the island of Taiwan

239
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Just a separate from this island

240
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
a stage of history

241
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
to explain the development of our Taiwan

242
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Therefore, from the perspective of Taiwan island history

243
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
to provide such a

244
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
A Viewpoint on Taiwan's History

245
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So because of this different view of history

246
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
tends to develop naturally

247
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
for taiwan

248
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
who is taiwanese

249
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
such an issue

250
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
there will be something different

251
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
some opinions

252
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
this is very much

253
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
check as if

254
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
on the media

255
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
on the page

256
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
various of these

257
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Randomly list out a few

258
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
result everyone

259
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He has different viewpoints

260
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
leftist

261
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There are also various viewpoints

262
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,720
So these things have actually become a big kind of entanglement in our Taiwanese society today, or one left over two.

263
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,680
disturbance

264
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
so what about me today

265
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,080
I'm a person who studies archaeology. What's the advantage?

266
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,560
I can ignore people now

267
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,200
because people are alive now

268
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,640
right

269
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,520
to speak face to face

270
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,040
to see

271
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,960
to discuss

272
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,800
to argue

273
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,720
but what about me today

274
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,120
I met the ancient people

275
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,480
So it's simpler

276
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,440
then i want this

277
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,360
After the research of this ancient man

278
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,360
What can we do with our research

279
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,800
go back and think about it

280
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,040
who is taiwanese

281
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Then their survival and development trajectory in Taiwan

282
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,040
but what

283
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,200
What are the traits they can conceive?

284
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:39,960
Then what

285
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,280
What about us Taiwanese today?

286
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,960
What kind of inspiration can he offer

287
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,800
I think this is what we actually

288
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,000
Generally speaking, we archaeologists

289
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,360
Is an ivory tower of knowledge

290
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,200
We just locked ourselves in an ivory tower to do research

291
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,040
has nothing to do with today's society

292
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,400
I think this is a completely wrong point of view

293
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,560
In fact, Vice President Wang also explained just now

294
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,000
actually

295
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,260
We who do archaeology don't just care about society

296
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,560
And many of them are actually closely related to society.

297
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,060
these interactions

298
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,760
Just now, Wangfu mentioned that the recent complex air crash

299
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,260
We actually have a place where archeology can play our role

300
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,660
We can also use our expertise

301
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,560
To assist in this financial river

302
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,860
Go hunt for these scumbags of this plane crash

303
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,660
Well, of course there are many other developments in our society

304
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,860
some cultural issues

305
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,560
In fact, archaeologists are very active in participating in

306
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,580
So we have a saying

307
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,320
Archaeologists from Taiwan

308
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,480
His other name is Fire Brigade

309
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,180
Because he went to fight the fire all day and night

310
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,980
Because there are too many things in Taiwan that need cultural rescue

311
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,880
Most of the many archaeologists came and went to serve as

312
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,780
So like environmental image assessment to do EIA work

313
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,580
Many archaeologists also participated in

314
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,880
So in fact, archaeologists and today's society

315
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,980
In fact, there is a very close relationship between these

316
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,620
So many modern issues

317
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,460
also from some different viewpoints

318
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,920
to provide some thoughts

319
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,300
so what

320
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,900
But how to meet the ancients

321
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,100
how to see ancient people

322
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,900
i want this one

323
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,100
These ancient people have disappeared

324
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,900
completely gone

325
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,300
but luckily

326
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,700
what about these ancient people

327
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,900
he walked back

328
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,100
he did the opposite

329
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,900
He must have left some traces

330
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,900
What about archaeologists?

331
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,500
Through the clues of these clues

332
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
What about these studies and these analyzes?

333
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,500
we still

334
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,600
there is still a chance

335
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,300
Can meet ancient people

336
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,300
so this is

337
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,200
what about archaeologists

338
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,900
a job that can be done

339
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,500
Then the data of archaeological research

340
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,800
probably basically

341
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
mainly through the legacy of these substances

342
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,500
because the ancient people

343
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,900
what about immaterial things

344
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,500
has disappeared

345
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:47,900
right

346
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,900
because it looks like some

347
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,100
What can't be saved?

348
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,300
all gone

349
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,700
He said he could stay

350
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,500
Basically these are these remnants of matter

351
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,800
And inside the material

352
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,900
Because basically it's these

353
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,740
non-organic

354
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,540
or non-perishable

355
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,860
to survive

356
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,220
This thing has become the treasure of archaeologists

357
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,300
Archaeologists use these things

358
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,260
To be able to get close to these ancient humans

359
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,940
So what about our research data?

360
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,900
basically contains these relics

361
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,460
ruins and ruins

362
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,500
These are the main materials we studied

363
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,140
then these things are archaeologists

364
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,300
Regardless of porcelain naughty stoneware

365
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,020
Regardless of the legacy of these plants, the legacy of animals

366
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,020
These are basically as long as archaeologists can discover

367
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,420
It can be used as these materials for its research

368
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,260
Then there are other so-called relics

369
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,860
It is some phenomena left over by ancient humans.

370
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,980
or some structure

371
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,700
So what can be found?

372
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,780
it can also be important

373
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,460
A material for archaeological research

374
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,460
So as for the acquisition of these materials

375
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,300
Archaeologists are two methods

376
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,980
an archaeological survey

377
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,380
The other is to do archaeological excavations

378
00:14:59,380 --> 00:14:59,980
archaeological investigation

379
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Just go to the wild to find it when it rains

380
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
through your pastor

381
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
through this drill of yours

382
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Even through some scientific means

383
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
like this one using ground penetrating radar

384
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
or other scientific means

385
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Come help us find the ancients

386
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
these ruins

387
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
or relic

388
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
so-called clues

389
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
able to find out

390
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So so this part

391
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I give an example

392
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Just now Vice President Wang mentioned

393
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
We are in Tainan Science Park

394
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Doing this archaeological investigation work for more than ten years

395
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
We are all through this method

396
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
do research first

397
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
through various means

398
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
including these simplest

399
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
just walk to observe

400
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
some drill

401
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
There are also some scientific

402
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
means of detection

403
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
want to discover in this area

404
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
buried under the ground

405
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The remains of these ancient humans

406
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
including ruins

407
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
or birth relics

408
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So so we're in this Nanke area

409
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
just found out you see

410
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
A Nanke found so many of these remnants

411
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
what about these ruins

412
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It represents different worlds

413
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
on this land

414
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
all these clues that flowed down

415
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
through this thread

416
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
to the people of this land

417
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
can have more understanding

418
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
still understand

419
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
This is our other method

420
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
is to excavate

421
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Some people joked about relying on scholars

422
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You have relied on scholars

423
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
hole by hole

424
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
what are you doing

425
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
This is called weasel burrowing

426
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Look, this is really a hole

427
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
In fact, our hole

428
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It is also a learned method

429
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
from the hole

430
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
to be very systematic

431
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Take these clues of ancient humans

432
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
can be found systematically

433
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
then do research

434
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
do patchwork

435
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
sorry

436
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
do you see us

437
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Weasel has burrowed

438
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
punch so many holes

439
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You see, this hole is actually

440
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
are very systematic

441
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Because the future underground

442
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
anything

443
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
We all have very detailed records

444
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
it is known

445
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
where did this come from

446
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
after you come out in the future

447
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
when it comes to putting it together

448
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
with the help of this system

449
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
this program

450
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
and can be completed

451
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Where are we in this Greedy Science Park?

452
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
did these on a very large scale

453
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
salvage these excavations

454
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
investigation

455
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So Chen Ru just said that Vice President Wang

456
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
we have tons of these relics

457
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So Central Court

458
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
He dare not let us ship back

459
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
after shipping back

460
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
He's going to help us build several houses

461
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
this is the most difficult thing

462
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I believe

463
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
then for these

464
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
These materials were unearthed

465
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Whether it's a relic

466
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Of course our next

467
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
we have to analyze

468
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
to study

469
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
If you do not analyze the research

470
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Impossible this pair is trash

471
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
but it can never have any effect

472
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Then we have to do a lot of analysis

473
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So archaeologists work very hard

474
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
He not only went to work in the field

475
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
After he came back from the field

476
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
take longer

477
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
to study

478
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
to analyze

479
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
to study

480
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
we can go

481
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
from here

482
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
how much to go

483
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
can let us understand a little bit

484
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Aspects of Ancient Humanity

485
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Then the first one is of course

486
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Do S

487
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
what the hell are we doing

488
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
what age

489
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Now there are many methods

490
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
There are many scientific methods

491
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The most commonly used method we call carbon fourteen

492
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
In this method, we only need to put the ground inside

493
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Some guerrilla values ​​unearthed

494
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Or charcoal sent to the laboratory for analysis

495
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Finally it can tell us

496
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
what is the age of the specimen itself

497
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This is by far the simplest

498
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And one of the most commonly used methods

499
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So help us understand the age of

500
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So like we are in Tainan Science Park

501
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
we are in different sites

502
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Different time

503
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
A chronological sequence can be established

504
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
so it's clear

505
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Each paragraph is clearly

506
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
these years

507
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
There is a lot of chronological data

508
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
allows us to map the entire region's

509
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
development of the age

510
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
can have a clear understanding

511
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
At the same time, other methods can be used

512
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
This is what we call stratigraphy

513
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
inside the ruins

514
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
can see through layers

515
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Types of items that can pass through

516
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
after combining the two

517
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
in a certain layer

518
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
it may be a certain age

519
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
This part is also in our archeology

520
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
often used

521
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
a way

522
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Therefore through these methods

523
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
We can map a region's

524
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
sequence of its culture

525
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
and some temporal changes in space

526
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
can clearly list it

527
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Like us in Tainan Science Park

528
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
from as early as 5,000 years

529
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Then come up and ask for the big benkeng culture

530
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Niu Chou Zi Culture

531
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Niaosong culture

532
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Hiraya culture

533
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
The last Han culture

534
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
A clear sequence of chronological development

535
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Then each one has a time

536
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
a category

537
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
can clearly let us know

538
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
This is all through chronological analysis

539
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
established by

540
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
In addition, it is very important for us to understand the ancient people

541
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
our life

542
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
In life, the people regard time as the sky

543
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
then this one

544
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So we need to understand what ancient people ate

545
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We also have many methods for this part

546
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
the best way

547
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
We were able to find some evidence directly

548
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
or some material

549
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Then this can tell us directly

550
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
what did he eat

551
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Like we are in Tainan Science Park

552
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
We found the row above

553
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
all this

554
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
As a look, the top row is

555
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
plant legacy

556
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
what's in the middle of this relic

557
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
There is rice

558
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
there is millet

559
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
melon pit

560
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And this hard worker, etc.

561
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
The remains of these many plants

562
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
these plants left behind

563
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
All why it can be preserved until now

564
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
because five thousand years

565
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
it should have rotted away

566
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
because of these things

567
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
They were all burned by this carbon.

568
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
carbonized

569
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So carbonize this

570
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
after being charred

571
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
turned into charcoal

572
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
so it doesn't perish easily

573
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So it can still be preserved

574
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
you see we now find out

575
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
there are so many of these

576
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
these millets

577
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
this millet

578
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
A lot of this 90,000 pieces of millet

579
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
This is the first time Taiwan has discovered

580
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,560
and a lot of rice stuff

581
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,560
are directly reflected

582
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,880
At that time, people could already eat these crops.

583
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,560
It can eat what it wants, of course it has to grow

584
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,160
it has the ability to farm

585
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,680
then like another like this part

586
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,120
There are many kinds of direct longevity bone fish bone

587
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,920
These also reflect the food that some people ate at that time

588
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,040
Then we will of course do some analysis on these materials

589
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,240
do some analysis

590
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,440
like this rice

591
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,240
We did analysis like morphology

592
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,120
Analysis of these morphology

593
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,280
Just look at its size and shape

594
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,640
can be observed

595
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,360
An evolution of these rices at different times

596
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,480
Because rice it will change again

597
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,240
its breed also changes

598
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,440
This change in farming techniques

599
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,440
It will also produce some changes in its species

600
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,560
So change from its shape

601
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,440
Also learn about a reimplementation of a

602
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Morphological development of rice

603
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,120
Want to see this is

604
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
about 4,500 years old

605
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
As the rice at that time looking at it

606
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
so small particles so small

607
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Then this modern we improved

608
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Taichung Taichung No. 9

609
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Taichung Taichung No. 10

610
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
These are the rice in our modern farms

611
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
As you can see its particles are very large

612
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
This represents the different breeds

613
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
time difference

614
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
resulting in different varieties of

615
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
these rice

616
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
These parts you need to go through our research

617
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
to find out

618
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
In addition, like these animals and plants are also

619
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
the bones of these animals like all of us

620
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
We all do these analyzes

621
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
At the same time, for each bone

622
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's not just about identifying its class

623
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And to identify it these animals

624
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
the existing environment

625
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
this can tell us

626
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It wasn't just humans at the time

627
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
it eats or exploits these animals

628
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It also reflects the climate of the time

629
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
because in what environment

630
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
what kind of animal does it have

631
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
so this part

632
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
must also be done in detail

633
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
analysis of these

634
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
In addition, if there is no direct evidence

635
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
These actual archaeological remains can be seen

636
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Then we can use many scientific methods

637
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
This is one of our most commonly used methods

638
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That is to say carbon 13 and carbon 14

639
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Analysis of this stable isotope

640
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Because these different plants

641
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So about the carbon thirteen and carbon fourteen isotopes

642
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
the constituents of the animal it is in

643
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
it is different

644
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
so so like this

645
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Which can be divided into have this

646
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Sorry, there is this C3 plant

647
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
C4 plants

648
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and plants in Haikou

649
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
terrestrial freshwater plants

650
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
it every animal

651
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
flora and fauna it's different

652
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So if we just want to analyze what's left of these animals

653
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Find the carbon 13 and carbon 14 from inside

654
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
carbon fifteen this

655
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
The quality of so-called quiet isotopes

656
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
let us speculate

657
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
At that time, he might have eaten a certain kind of

658
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
these plants

659
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
What is the environment in which it exists?

660
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,520
So this is all using the scientific method

661
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,200
I'm just listing one

662
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,920
In fact, there are many ways

663
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,160
can help us go

664
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,120
Even if you find no direct evidence

665
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,240
From some circumstantial evidence, you can

666
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,720
Let us understand what ancient people ate

667
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,640
Then what else is it like where we live?

668
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,200
What was the life style of this ancient man?

669
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,600
What is the form of living

670
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,000
The most direct evidence of this is, of course,

671
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,480
we are inside the archaeological site

672
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,560
You can dig into the houses of ancient people

673
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,960
we can say what house he lives in

674
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,680
right

675
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,160
So if you can't dig the house

676
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,440
at least you can have some relics

677
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,800
like our ruins

678
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,000
Everyone, look at this one by one

679
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,360
one by one these little by little

680
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,040
what is this

681
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,200
This is how the ancient people lived in the house

682
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,040
The holes for the pillars he dug when he made the foundation

683
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,800
So the pillar holes can be spread out in this land

684
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
when we dig

685
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,360
Everyone, be very, very careful

686
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,520
That's why some people say that archeology is so slow

687
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,040
we are at the construction site

688
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm always behind these weird hands

689
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
wait until later

690
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
to build a house

691
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
to open a factory

692
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
we dug very slowly

693
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
they will scold

694
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
how can you be so slow

695
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Actually he doesn't know

696
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
we're going to dig this up

697
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
this is very very slow

698
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
If you hurry up, you won't be able to see

699
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So after digging out

700
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
can be displayed

701
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
the house at that time

702
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
About 3000 years ago

703
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
one shot house

704
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
just let us help

705
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
let's rebuild

706
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
The shape of the house at that time

707
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Also in the middle of each house

708
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and these sticks

709
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It was the people at that time

710
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
he may be a family unit

711
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
after someone died

712
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
buried between this house and the house

713
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
as look over here

714
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You see these are all buried here

715
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
this reflects

716
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
At that time the whole settlement

717
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
this one by one situation

718
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
In addition, we can get from

719
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
the whole comprehensive

720
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
chair excavation

721
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
can come to rebuild

722
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
The shape of the whole settlement

723
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
this is inside a chair

724
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
reflected by

725
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
These houses and green sticks

726
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
People are buried in this tomb after they die

727
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
In addition, there is this suffix in the middle, I can't read clearly

728
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
there are some circle points

729
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
These movements of houses

730
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Stationary moving flow

731
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Then the ones next to it are darker

732
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It's the garbage dump we're talking about

733
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
is to dump the rubbish where it settles

734
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
We are the same now

735
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Now our garbage will be thrown next to the village

736
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So this represents a small village at that time

737
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Its whole we can excavate through archeology

738
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
dig out

739
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
After this excavation

740
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Then of course it directly reflects

741
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
A living form of people at that time

742
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Another form of settlement

743
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Then, of course, we will also learn about a settlement.

744
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
not only its settlement itself

745
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and the relationship between the settlement and the surrounding environment

746
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So we can also go through some theoretical discussions

747
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Come and learn about this settlement

748
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
The relationship between the position of the chair and its surroundings

749
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Why does this settlement live here

750
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So what's the special reason for it's

751
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
This settlement will choose this location here

752
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
the various environments around and around

753
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
this is the relationship we're talking about

754
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
This is also called

755
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
our participle is called

756
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
always giving analysis

757
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
This is a method of analysis

758
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
In addition, through some theoretical analysis, we can

759
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
make use of economic geography

760
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
so-called middle ground theory

761
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
叫Central Place Theory

762
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
this section to learn about these

763
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
inside this area

764
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
all the different clubs

765
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
relationship with each other

766
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
with some of its reflections

767
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
social meaning

768
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
like representing different social structures

769
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
a social formation

770
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
it will render different

771
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
These forms of these clubs

772
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Another analysis like this social structure

773
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
We understand that there was no society

774
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
what kind of society

775
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Is it an egalitarian society after all?

776
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
or a stratified society

777
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
This society can

778
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
archaeological data to understand

779
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
look like this

780
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
this is a stick

781
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
This stick is actually

782
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
it can tell us

783
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
a lot about this

784
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
training in social structure

785
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
like these as seen

786
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
inside these sticks

787
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,280
Sorry, sorry, I don't know how to do this yet

788
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,640
So, this one, these lines of recruitment are in the village

789
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,920
then it's inside

790
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,480
it can get from it's this burial thing

791
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,120
Can reflect a social status among people

792
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,440
or a difference in wealth using the difference

793
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,960
In addition, it is said that some of the funeral objects it buried

794
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,280
It can also reflect some differences between

795
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
So what about this solicitation?

796
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,200
It is a reflection of social structure

797
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,480
a very important piece of evidence

798
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,000
Of course there are many other evidences

799
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,400
settlement like this

800
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,000
Then this is the site of the Hongshan Culture in the northeast of the mainland

801
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,040
It is calculated using mathematical models

802
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,200
Look at the closeness of a distance between each settlement

803
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,800
then to distinguish

804
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,400
words like here

805
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,400
like this this as see this

806
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,200
These are different

807
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,840
What about this area?

808
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,120
it can be divided into four pieces

809
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Look at this one, two dollars, three dollars, four dollars

810
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,500
Then it is reflected in the highest mathematical model

811
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,000
It is all the settlements, it is more concentrated

812
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,500
The density of its entire space is very tight

813
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,000
Then this thing reflects it

814
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
In this area, it is entirely within the social structure

815
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
it may represent a different meaning

816
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Maybe it represents Japan, represents a city

817
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,500
That next to it might represent the countryside, or something more remote.

818
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,000
Then this reflects the whole

819
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It is an urbanized

820
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
or a hierarchical

821
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
such a social form

822
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Then this is using this different method

823
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
We come and go to learn about some settlements of ancient humans

824
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
some forms

825
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Then in addition, like the eleven cylinders in life

826
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Like this one is the best of course we are also the best

827
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
there is direct evidence

828
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It can be like this is us in Tainan Science Park

829
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
found a large number of this visitor

830
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
What is this visitor doing?

831
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,600
like a spinning

832
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,200
represent it spinning thread

833
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,500
It has thread to make clothes from

834
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,600
Represents that the technology of spinning thread already existed at that time

835
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,100
But on the other hand, it is also found that

836
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,400
as can't see anything

837
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,500
This is a broken

838
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,300
this stick

839
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,000
a stick

840
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,500
Here are the stripes

841
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,700
Someone read it and I said what is this

842
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,500
He said it's called Husband Beater

843
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,700
It's a warrior's stick

844
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,400
because this can hit

845
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,600
In fact, this is a bat called bark cloth

846
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,900
It's made of bark cloth

847
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,400
So this is what was inside our clothes

848
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
In addition to imitation

849
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,900
it also uses bark

850
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,200
make bark cloth

851
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,500
There is also direct evidence of this in archaeological sites.

852
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,000
these people are called ropes

853
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,700
like this imitated line

854
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,500
Roll it out like this and become that kind of rope

855
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,000
This is inside the archaeological site

856
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,900
can also occasionally be found

857
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,000
when expectations are good

858
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,600
These can be preserved without rotting away

859
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,300
So these things are some

860
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,300
about when

861
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,200
Some of the most direct of the time

862
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,920
some so-called evidence some evidence

863
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,680
In addition, of course, like through some decorations on the person itself

864
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,800
Like this one inside a stick

865
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,200
As a look it has a lot of shark teeth

866
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,640
This thing was a decoration at that time

867
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,880
ornament as look

868
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,920
After it is strung together, it becomes like this

869
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,880
An act representing the adornment of everyone at the time

870
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,000
This is the same

871
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,360
Many utensils are also displayed

872
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,400
These things can be used as

873
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,800
At that time, I learned that it was a form of decoration at that time

874
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,440
In addition, the so-called earrings are also stuffed on the ears.

875
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,280
this is an earring

876
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,680
This is all direct evidence that tells us

877
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,160
reflect the clothing of the time

878
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,120
such a situation

879
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,800
This is what we can base on various evidences

880
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,440
after putting it back together

881
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,040
Humans at that time

882
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,480
This was probably around 2000

883
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
What about humans at this time?

884
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
he was clumsy

885
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
such a situation

886
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
In addition, technology

887
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
We want ancient people how to make things

888
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Technology

889
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
In fact, there are quite a lot of methods

890
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
like making pottery

891
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
we can use these

892
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
These features on pottery

893
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
These morphological features

894
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
also to restore his pottery

895
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
every step

896
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
This, of course, requires some analysis

897
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
like the fire of these pottery

898
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
and the erection of pottery, etc.

899
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
can help us rebuild

900
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
At that time a technique for making pottery

901
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
In addition, the same is true

902
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
such a practical

903
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
what is it for

904
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
how it is made

905
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It is also possible to use some experimental methods

906
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Then we rebuild

907
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
At that time the actual

908
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
its possible use

909
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
this is the same

910
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
this is a knife

911
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
was used to speculate

912
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
probably for cutting

913
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
to harvest

914
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
broken

915
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
We can experimentally

916
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
come help us go

917
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
through these other analytical methods

918
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Include this analysis of utility traces

919
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And on the wind blade of this knife

920
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
These chemical analyzes of some residues

921
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
come help us rebuild

922
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
the knife itself

923
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
the way it's used

924
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
function and the technology it makes

925
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
That can also help us to

926
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
archaeological data

927
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
allows us to understand the ancient

928
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
some doubts about life

929
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
its life doubt

930
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
people know this person in his lifetime

931
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
there will be many suspicions

932
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
There are many suspicions of birth, old age, illness and death

933
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
like this from this like this

934
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Most sticks inside

935
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
can understand when a person dies

936
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
how to deal with it

937
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's a deadly suspicion

938
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
As it looks like this is

939
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
This is probably in

940
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
The 2,500-year-old site

941
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
above as seen

942
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
This man is buried in it

943
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Next to this is the viewing tree

944
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
This view has emerged

945
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
But we can dig through this very carefully

946
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Can dig out traces of its closing curtain

947
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
and then in the man's bones themselves

948
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
is it lying down

949
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Barbarians like now are rotten people

950
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
This is a common custom in this society

951
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
so dirty

952
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
In addition to this above

953
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
must be on every roof of it

954
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
There must be a clay pot

955
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
There's something in this clay pot

956
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
We analyze some food in it

957
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
like bones chicken bones

958
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
fish bones with food

959
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
This is an offering

960
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
a sacrificial

961
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
a sacrificial pottery

962
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
above so it must be above the head of its house

963
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
will put this sacrifice

964
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So this is one of the society at that time

965
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
a common burial a custom

966
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
a ritual habit

967
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Well so this is where we get back together

968
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
At that time, it was probably a kind of burial, a sacrificial ritual

969
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
that additionally acts as

970
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Everyone look at this

971
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,600
This is a human skeleton of a woman

972
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,200
You see it between the legs

973
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,300
and a baby

974
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:08,800
Have you seen

975
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,200
This looks like it will be very impressive

976
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:12,900
because of what

977
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,700
because of this person

978
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,000
This woman may have had a difficult labor during labor

979
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,600
Both mother and child were disturbed after she was born

980
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,800
it's all passed away

981
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,400
so when she buried

982
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,000
And put her little one in mother's

983
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,500
the middle of the thigh

984
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,400
this child

985
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,100
This thing is through our archeology

986
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,300
very careful excavation

987
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,700
To be able to find this phenomenon

988
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,700
able to dig out

989
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,600
also reflected

990
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,400
At that time, there was something about death in this society.

991
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,000
a treat for this matter

992
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,200
like in this amusement society

993
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,000
A child is not treated as a person at all

994
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,700
So just throw it away after you die

995
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,800
eaten by dogs

996
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,100
But in this society

997
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,900
we got from another ranch

998
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,200
He has always had great respect for children

999
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,100
also very good

1000
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,300
Even if he is a small child

1001
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,900
It also covers him very well.

1002
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Also like this man his teeth

1003
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
This is the same as Han Xi's Taiwanese aborigines

1004
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
There is such a custom of tooth extraction

1005
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
We know tooth extraction is a ritual

1006
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
like many adults in aboriginal

1007
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Or one that he has military exploits

1008
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
he may perform some kind of ceremony

1009
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Pulling out his front teeth

1010
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Second incisor Lateral incisor

1011
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
His teeth were pulled out

1012
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Such a custom is present in our aboriginal society

1013
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
In the past, there were still many tribes

1014
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
There is also the custom of tooth extraction

1015
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
This can be found in the pastoral chapter

1016
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
can let us understand the life at that time

1017
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
A manifestation of life I

1018
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
In addition, what we just talked about

1019
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
It's all material

1020
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
In fact, it is spiritual

1021
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
We can pass through many material first-class

1022
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
The same can help us to

1023
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Restoring the manpower of the past

1024
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,300
some leading states

1025
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,100
Like this from many artifacts

1026
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,400
We can learn about its cognitive

1027
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
in this respect as it does for aesthetics

1028
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,600
for aesthetic

1029
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,200
such a cognition

1030
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,700
In addition, some religious beliefs and so on are reflected

1031
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,900
In fact, many can still be obtained from material

1032
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,800
Come and help us to rebuild

1033
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,200
guys look like this

1034
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,900
This is what was unearthed inside our chair

1035
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,400
These images of these faces

1036
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,100
Everyone, look at this, it's very cute

1037
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,600
It's kind of like ET's

1038
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,700
like space

1039
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,100
look like a man from outer space

1040
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,700
I don't know if they've seen aliens

1041
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,300
But this is the Model it made

1042
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,700
actually very much like

1043
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,000
like this one from ET

1044
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,900
like this is

1045
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,100
then this is a

1046
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,100
it seems we often talk

1047
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,500
This looks a bit like an Indian

1048
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,900
Everyone look at this high nose

1049
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,900
this hair

1050
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,200
like a foreigner now

1051
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,900
So this representative was the person at the time

1052
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,000
his kind of difference between you and me

1053
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,100
he saw these people look

1054
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,100
make him different

1055
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So he made a performance in the cognition of a group of people

1056
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
There is also a lot of information on these

1057
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
like this tomb staff

1058
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
in the whole society

1059
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
in burial customs

1060
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
its cognition

1061
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
All avatars must face in one direction

1062
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
This picture is from the north

1063
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
everyone look north

1064
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
will face north

1065
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
in other cultures

1066
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
all facing south

1067
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Facing south

1068
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
This reflects the beliefs of the time

1069
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
maybe

1070
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
like they are now muslim

1071
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
this islam

1072
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So all of his people are headed towards Mai's house

1073
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
The manifestation of such a concept

1074
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
In addition, of course the substance

1075
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
There are many transactions

1076
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So we are in this will

1077
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Lots of items to trade can be found

1078
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
not natively generated

1079
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
it reflects a transaction

1080
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
This deal has a short distance deal

1081
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
or long-distance transactions

1082
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
able to come from far away

1083
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
or available nearby

1084
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
These things are a

1085
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
human interaction

1086
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
an act of trading

1087
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
Therefore, through the analysis of these materials

1088
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,600
Materials like these can be analyzed from its raw material

1089
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Analysis from its place of origin

1090
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,000
to understand the possible sources of these things

1091
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,800
And the behavior of a transaction that may represent behind it

1092
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
this part

1093
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,000
You can see that this is about a thousand years ago in Taiwan

1094
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,400
These ancient humans in Taiwan had a lot of transactions with these Han people

1095
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,200
Just saw these magnets

1096
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,400
these peachy

1097
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,800
these brass and so on

1098
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,800
It was all obtained through a kind of exchange between the Han people

1099
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,400
In addition, you can also learn about the behavior of ancient humans in war.

1100
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
let's watch

1101
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,400
The most direct evidence of this is that we can get

1102
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
Pay attention to this sentence, human bones

1103
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,600
It looks pretty pitiful at first

1104
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,800
so it's on

1105
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,300
this is this look at this thing

1106
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,400
it's an archery arrow

1107
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
arrow

1108
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,400
These arrows shot under this leash of it

1109
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,400
In addition, it also had a kind of wound on its lumbar spine

1110
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Then he was hit by an arrow on the hand bone of the lower limb bone of this hand

1111
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So he has an arrow in his waist

1112
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
so he got hit by several arrows

1113
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
This represented a conflicting behavior at the time

1114
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Of course in ancient times these wars

1115
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
In fact, he may not really be a war

1116
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
some are rituals

1117
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
like this beheading thing

1118
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
In fact, he must represent

1119
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So it must be a conflict between the two ethnic groups

1120
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
He sometimes represents a ritual

1121
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Beheading like this represents being in a society

1122
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
he has a special ritual

1123
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
a meaning

1124
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
like this guy too

1125
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
As a look at him too

1126
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
There's a suspicious arrow here

1127
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Here the head was chopped off

1128
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
This head is gone

1129
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
head cut off

1130
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Then this hand shot an arrow here

1131
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
There is an arrow here

1132
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Have you seen

1133
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
the head is missing

1134
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
This represents a kind of

1135
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,880
conflict or war

1136
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,240
But we are in Taiwan

1137
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,040
I have been doing archaeology for so long

1138
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,880
tell the truth

1139
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,800
Our Ancient Ancestors in Taiwan

1140
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,080
he is very peaceful

1141
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,240
We did not find any

1142
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,040
This situation of mass killing

1143
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,840
Occasionally, one or two things like this are found

1144
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,320
This body was beheaded

1145
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,360
Or just one or two

1146
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,120
We have not found such a million species

1147
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,440
Or the situation of mass killings

1148
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,840
Basically it's pretty peaceful

1149
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,440
such a society

1150
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,320
Everyone saw this just now

1151
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,960
This is what we round up

1152
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,040
probably it's here

1153
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,480
this is from the front

1154
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,920
from the tip of the shot

1155
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,480
This is the sign shot from behind

1156
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,440
or an arrow shot it to death

1157
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,560
Then cut off the head

1158
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,560
cut off the head

1159
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,200
wrap hands

1160
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,880
In addition, for these diseases of ancient people

1161
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,840
physical condition can also be

1162
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,560
These archaeological data to explain

1163
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,000
like this through this person

1164
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
We can understand the symptoms of many diseases

1165
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
like the most common

1166
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Easiest to see is dental disease

1167
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
everybody look

1168
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
This is also dental disease

1169
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
The one here is called Nongyang

1170
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Its tooth root can run this way

1171
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
see it doesn't

1172
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Then of course cast teeth

1173
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
this is the most common

1174
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
this asian disease

1175
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
This is the most common disease

1176
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Also like here

1177
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
There's a tumor here

1178
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
This man has a large tumor on his head

1179
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
The other most common is this

1180
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Herniation of this vertebral disc

1181
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
like this

1182
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
we talk about this

1183
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
We usually talk about bone spurs

1184
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
In addition to the bone itself

1185
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
these anemias

1186
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
This nutritional deficiency and so on

1187
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
can pass through these human bones

1188
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
to understand

1189
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
This also reflects

1190
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Not just the state of human health at the time

1191
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It also reflects the nutritional status of the

1192
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It also reflects the environmental conditions at that time

1193
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,600
some things about many, many ancient people

1194
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,400
so these

1195
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
so this aspect

1196
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,400
there are many

1197
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,200
provide us with an understanding of ancient humans'

1198
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,400
a lot of these

1199
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,000
these about health

1200
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,400
environment nutrition

1201
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,600
and its labor

1202
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,000
Some are too tired

1203
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,300
will also be left on the body

1204
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,000
many of these traces

1205
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,600
so this part

1206
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,300
can also

1207
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,400
These are very precious materials

1208
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,400
can now also understand

1209
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,700
Did Ancient People Have Lung Disease?

1210
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,800
TB

1211
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,800
punch the bone

1212
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,700
You can also learn about infectious diseases, etc.

1213
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,500
in addition

1214
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,100
Finally we want to understand

1215
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,400
what do you want to look like

1216
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,000
what does it look like

1217
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Now we also have many ways

1218
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,100
The most traditional method now

1219
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,200
Just use these human bones

1220
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,500
We can see us as human bones

1221
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,600
we can

1222
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,600
find a human skull

1223
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,200
We can now take advantage of advanced equipment

1224
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,800
This is 3D scanning

1225
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,000
ready to print

1226
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,500
So 3D printing

1227
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,100
can take this man to the bone

1228
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,800
can print it out

1229
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,900
become like this

1230
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,900
become this

1231
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,120
a mold comes out

1232
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,160
Then put this mold

1233
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,720
and then remolding

1234
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,480
turned into a

1235
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,760
A rice in a mold inside

1236
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,560
Then above this we pass through

1237
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,000
This so-called muscle filling

1238
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,920
This muscle filling is not random filling

1239
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,000
must be based on a lot of data

1240
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,480
Through anatomical data

1241
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,400
to learn about different races

1242
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,200
the probable thickness of its muscles

1243
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,240
and muscle growth

1244
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,200
Then according to this thing

1245
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,600
Let's do some muscle filling

1246
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,720
Finally we can have some

1247
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,600
archaeological art

1248
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,400
This person is here to help us

1249
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,440
to restore

1250
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,520
contains its hair

1251
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,640
hair eyebrows

1252
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,240
whole face etc.

1253
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,600
to restore

1254
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,720
This is in our Tantan Science Park

1255
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,720
A skull from about 5,000 years ago

1256
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,480
Finally we based on these skulls

1257
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,680
can be recovered

1258
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,920
A face of the possible length at that time

1259
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,160
what kind of thing

1260
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,840
so we do quite a bit

1261
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
We can be in different times

1262
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
These human bones of us in different times

1263
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Finally recovered

1264
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
This was about a thousand years ago

1265
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Ancient humans in Taiwan

1266
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
You see, she looks a little prettier

1267
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
this is a female

1268
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
these a male

1269
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Well, this is when they

1270
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
after death

1271
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Human bones look like this

1272
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
This is also through some scientific methods

1273
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
restore it

1274
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
now there is another way

1275
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
computer simulation, etc.

1276
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
to restore the face of ancient people

1277
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
a look

1278
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Then finally we can put all

1279
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Eleven aspects of these materials are annotated

1280
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
war its society and more

1281
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
can put the whole time

1282
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
the face of human life

1283
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
to do a comprehensive

1284
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
such a recovery

1285
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
so in addition

1286
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
That is, we can also understand the human environment at that time

1287
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
What was the living environment like at that time?

1288
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
This we can use through

1289
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Analysis of Soil by Valley

1290
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
The strict detective of the earth's core and so on

1291
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,440
to do these analyzes

1292
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,680
But it's impossible for me to go into detail here

1293
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,800
Then this part can come and let us rebuild

1294
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,440
The environments that humans faced at that time

1295
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,760
Of course, this environment can also include the

1296
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,160
Through animal legacy, plant legacy, etc.

1297
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,640
to tell us about the circumstances

1298
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,200
like the weather

1299
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,720
but what about the season

1300
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,920
and the nearby surrounding landforms at that time

1301
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,240
what is the terrain like

1302
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,120
can help us recover

1303
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,080
Then this is in our solar science park

1304
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,240
Through this extended new expert

1305
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,640
Taking Soil Analysis

1306
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,200
we can come back

1307
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,800
The location of Nanke at that time

1308
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,200
In fact, where was the scope at that time?

1309
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,400
here is the sea

1310
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,560
At that time the settlement has been here

1311
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,720
it's all by the sea

1312
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,160
there are people who live by the sea

1313
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,120
This is right next to the beach for living

1314
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,640
But now you can see

1315
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,960
As a mainlander from Tainan, you know

1316
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,200
This is Qigu

1317
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,920
Currently at the beach

1318
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,240
Now Nanke's work is in the sea

1319
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,400
in sea field

1320
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,800
It's 20 kilometers away

1321
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,400
time difference of 5000 years

1322
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,400
The sea was still here in 5000 years

1323
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,400
around here in about 3000

1324
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,000
now the beach

1325
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,200
the coast is here too

1326
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,200
Qigu

1327
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,000
Yantian on Qigu's side is here

1328
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,400
So the distance between them is more than 20 kilometers

1329
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,000
So we talk about sea fields

1330
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But this can be found through our archaeological research

1331
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,400
You can also do something based on the environment at that time

1332
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,000
these endowments

1333
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,400
In addition, of course we have to understand a culture

1334
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,400
Ancients and his relationship

1335
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,000
what is his source

1336
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,400
where did he come from

1337
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,400
This part is inside archeology

1338
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,400
It is also possible to use these typological comparisons

1339
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,000
The ratio angle of these vapors

1340
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,900
Now through the comparison of the DNA of the crowd

1341
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:54,100
There are also animals raised in living things, etc.

1342
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,800
You can come to know the source of these people

1343
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,100
where the hell

1344
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,900
This is in Tainan Academy of Sciences area

1345
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,100
5000 years ago

1346
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,500
This human speculates about his origin

1347
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,500
After comparing these analyzes

1348
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,240
His source is from

1349
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,500
Probably from south of Fujian to Hainan Island

1350
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,500
up this coast

1351
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,000
It is probably between the culture of Taiwan 5,000 years ago

1352
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,500
very close relationship

1353
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,500
their source

1354
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,000
Their home probably came from this place

1355
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,500
This can also be told through these data

1356
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,500
In addition, the relationship between people

1357
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,500
In addition to the typological comparison on this artifact

1358
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,500
Now this is also

1359
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:37,500
The so-called genetic analysis and comparison of this ethnic group

1360
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,000
then this aspect

1361
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,500
We've actually done a lot so far

1362
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,500
That's us in Nanke

1363
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,500
This is a site of the Three Treasures

1364
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,000
DNA extracted from his bones

1365
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
come to know these people

1366
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,500
where he may have been a source

1367
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:55,000
and genetic relationships with other populations

1368
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
In addition, through these human bones themselves,

1369
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Some of his measured features

1370
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,600
Some measured features can also be used to understand the relationship between each other

1371
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,160
So this aspect is also very important in archaeology.

1372
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,280
To understand the relationship between people and people

1373
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,280
This is a very important means

1374
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,720
this is what we do

1375
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,120
Our knowledge quiz in January

1376
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,600
Professor Chen Zhongyu's work on guiding people

1377
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,960
This is the Marx Planck Institute in Germany

1378
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,560
The DNA they made out of the Quantitative Humans

1379
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,360
genetic analysis

1380
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,120
Discover the haploids inside

1381
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,120
The so-called 10,000 haploid

1382
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,480
its distribution throughout the region

1383
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,520
This can also give us some clues

1384
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,920
movement of these people

1385
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,640
direction of movement

1386
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,640
source of movement etc.

1387
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,680
so

1388
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,000
Mainly to introduce to you

1389
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,280
How Archeology Gets Closer to the Ancients

1390
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,040
It's easy for us modern people

1391
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,080
meet every day

1392
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,880
But the ancient people actually

1393
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,800
Must go through these archaeological crowns

1394
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,680
Among the data unearthed

1395
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,080
then bit by bit

1396
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,760
Through these clues

1397
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,520
Let's turn the life of ancient human beings into

1398
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,000
slowly piece it together

1399
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,520
How much can we finally know

1400
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,240
What was the condition of the ancient people?

1401
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,600
Of course he won't stand up and argue to me

1402
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,760
He won't stand up and say you're wrong

1403
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,800
But I guess it's all archeology itself

1404
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,360
He must be a scientific

1405
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,640
what he made

1406
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,200
Must conform to some scientific principles

1407
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,680
some level of science

1408
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:35,680
Then like this

1409
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,760
Then I think the ancients

1410
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,280
Even if he is lying on the ground

1411
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,360
He won't come to protest

1412
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,160
Then the following because of the relationship of time

1413
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,640
so I

1414
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,560
Now I'm going to put some of what we've put together

1415
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,560
Let me tell a few stories about ancient people

1416
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,360
this story

1417
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,000
Then this is what we do in so many archaeological works

1418
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,320
I just picked a few out

1419
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,080
Maybe you are more interested

1420
00:50:59,240 --> 00:50:59,960
or more concerned

1421
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,640
Let me give you a brief report

1422
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,440
The first one is the legend of the black ditch

1423
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,800
We know the Black Ditch, everyone knows

1424
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,560
This one is the Penghu Trench

1425
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,520
This is between Penghu and Taiwan

1426
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:18,560
Probably from this part of Penghu

1427
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:22,800
To the south until the waters of southern Taiwan

1428
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,760
There is a strong, diffuse sea

1429
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,920
The sea water depth is about 60 meters to about 100 meters

1430
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,080
such a depth

1431
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,080
very famous recently

1432
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,240
I just told our vice president

1433
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,720
One day news in Taiwan

1434
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,000
then it's gone

1435
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,680
But there is a lot of news abroad

1436
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,960
famous foreign magazines

1437
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,160
There are many journals that are still being discussed

1438
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,240
I also saw a Filipino magazine yesterday

1439
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,920
still discussing this issue

1440
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,440
This was here a few days ago

1441
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,680
Probably a few weeks ago

1442
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,120
The Department of Natural Sciences in Taichung

1443
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,020
Dr. Zhang Junxiang in the museum

1444
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,340
He did a press conference to publish

1445
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:09,160
Said they were in the waters of Penghu

1446
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,000
one of the found

1447
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,540
This is the so-called Xia Hangu

1448
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,540
This is the jaw

1449
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,900
jaw of a man's jaw ancient

1450
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,340
Well, everyone, look at Chin Bagu

1451
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,840
it's very primitive

1452
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,540
Can't see

1453
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:22,540
words like ours

1454
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,700
Our current people are relatively slender

1455
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,460
Do you see this?

1456
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:28,580
it's very out of shape

1457
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:32,160
And the whole assault was very obvious

1458
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,080
because of its teeth

1459
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,840
Everyone looks very big

1460
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,280
this is its old tooth

1461
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,520
this is very big

1462
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,400
then grind hard

1463
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,120
Then such a lower Russian ancient

1464
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,960
Then Dr. Zhang Junxiang

1465
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,400
then he speculates

1466
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,880
His age should be around 190,000 years

1467
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,580
to 450,000 years

1468
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,200
Of course his age

1469
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,080
not quite sure yet

1470
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,080
because he is using this

1471
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,300
Human Lower Russian

1472
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,380
Buddha contained in the upper

1473
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,160
Buddha and that

1474
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,480
its two elemental composition

1475
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,540
Then Bijiao is in the same sea area

1476
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,100
unearthed hound's

1477
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,380
a sea duck

1478
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,660
It's on the Hound

1479
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,200
its relative angle

1480
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,300
two almost similar branches

1481
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:26,880
Then this hunting dog is probably in East Asia

1482
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,420
the age of its existence

1483
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,220
should probably exist in

1484
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,000
About 300,000 to 400,000 years

1485
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,060
will probably disappear in the future

1486
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,380
So the evidence thus becomes the inference

1487
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,660
This one is from Lower Russia

1488
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,940
evidence of its age

1489
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,260
So Dr. Zhang also infers that this age is 190,000 years

1490
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,040
that's all

1491
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,820
About 450,000 years or less

1492
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,860
such an age

1493
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,140
Of course we don't care now

1494
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,400
regardless of this

1495
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,200
Is the age correct?

1496
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,260
Then this lower Russia

1497
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,820
Of course, from its shape

1498
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,360
it is a very

1499
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:58,360
ancient

1500
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,160
very primitive of a human

1501
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,000
That's why Dr. Zhang Junxiang called it a Bloomberg Yuanren

1502
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,000
So he thinks that this person's closest relative is in Anhui in the mainland

1503
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Anhui Youming and Xianyuan people

1504
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
This is in the range of 500,000 to 300,000 years for the Xianyuan people

1505
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
So he thinks there is a relationship between the two

1506
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
So of course it caused a lot of discussion after it was published.

1507
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Especially in some foreign publications in this anthropological field

1508
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
There is a lot of discussion on this

1509
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Some people think it's too early

1510
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's too early because it's unlikely

1511
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Why? Because in this East Asian region

1512
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Especially in Southeast Asia

1513
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Now on an island called Floris in Indonesia

1514
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:53,000
The remains of a so-called very primitive human were also found

1515
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Then his age is 18,000 years

1516
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
18000

1517
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
so their their this

1518
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,640
this man is very small

1519
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,900
so is a very small one

1520
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,760
a so-called Homo erectus

1521
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,400
So the original person is such a

1522
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,560
So what is the relationship between

1523
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,760
Therefore, further discussion is required

1524
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,440
Then this is Wazuhara

1525
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,720
This is the Hexian original man found in Hexian, Anhui

1526
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,480
So Dr. Zhang Junxiang put the lower frontal bone

1527
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,520
with this person

1528
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:30,320
So I think it's the same related two people

1529
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,880
He thinks it was probably during the Ice Age

1530
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,120
at that time

1531
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:33,880
it's cold

1532
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,280
in the ice age

1533
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,720
Humans moved from north to south to a warmer place

1534
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,640
Taiwan's Penghu area

1535
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,800
It should be relatively warm

1536
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,400
so hard to run

1537
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,480
so this person

1538
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,360
He has remained in this place

1539
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,320
keep his original shape, a state

1540
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,760
Then this is the so-called Penghu Haidu

1541
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,800
between Penghu and Taiwan

1542
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,080
Then this Dr. Zhang Junxiang

1543
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,600
Dr. Lilac said that this specimen came from this trench

1544
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:08,280
And then this specimen was actually supposedly picked up by a fisherman

1545
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,760
fisherman salvaged

1546
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,880
Later it was sold to a shareholder

1547
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,720
Then what about their science center?

1548
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,280
I asked him to buy it from the shareholder again.

1549
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,120
I thought it was important so I bought it

1550
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,840
So this is not a scientific discovery

1551
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,200
or scientific research

1552
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,680
It is basically a point and a

1553
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,720
a second hand an acquired

1554
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,960
such a data

1555
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,800
Well, this is the so-called Taiwan Strait

1556
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,760
What about looking at the Taiwan Strait?

1557
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,120
This was about 18,000 years ago

1558
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,160
It's basically land here.

1559
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,600
We know that after 18,000 years

1560
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,440
Eighteen thousand years from now, the Ice Banner will end

1561
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:46,960
after the end

1562
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,800
Then the sea level slowly rises

1563
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,680
so until now

1564
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,320
we become the taiwan strait

1565
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,120
But eighteen thousand years ago

1566
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,840
This is basically the situation here

1567
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,240
This is still a situation next to a continent

1568
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,760
So this just said this

1569
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,000
The origin of Penghu is located in

1570
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,800
In the sea area, apart from the Penghe injustice just mentioned

1571
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:13,500
In fact, a large number of these large non-human fossils have been found in the past

1572
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,800
Most of these fossils are fishermen

1573
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:20,100
Because this sea area is very deep, about 60 meters, 90 meters to 120 meters

1574
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:23,300
This is very deep, generally like our underwater archaeology

1575
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,500
we can't go down this deep

1576
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,000
So a lot of fishermen get off their net

1577
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,500
After getting off the net, except for a lot of live fish jumping around

1578
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,300
There are a lot of things that can't jump, these big things

1579
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,500
So the local fishermen are scared

1580
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,300
At first, I was very scared and felt that there was a bad omen.

1581
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:44,000
So there are some throwing there and putting it next to the temple and throwing it there

1582
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,100
dare not ask him

1583
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:50,200
Later, after some of these antiquities dealers or fossil collectors discovered

1584
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,500
I think this is a treasure, so I started to collect this thing

1585
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,500
So now become a water boat

1586
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,900
So it becomes very valuable

1587
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,000
So now many fishermen are constantly

1588
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,880
You can also find it while fishing

1589
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,920
This is a captain named Hong in Penghu

1590
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,080
one of his boats

1591
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,720
He often fishes in the sea

1592
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,920
He often gets these

1593
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,400
These things that used to be considered bad omens

1594
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,880
Now he's a baby

1595
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,800
So a whole warehouse in his house

1596
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,880
all of these

1597
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,720
as look

1598
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,240
as see this is he fishing

1599
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,640
he can fish

1600
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,800
A lot of fun

1601
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,720
he fished

1602
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,880
catch a bone

1603
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,000
not a fish

1604
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,600
But he also caught a fish

1605
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,920
This is the archeology of water effect that we did

1606
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,000
Follow him to investigate

1607
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,880
This is our boat in the black ditch

1608
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,160
a condition of our trawl

1609
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,760
This is where we do our research

1610
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,960
As you can see, this is Baisha Island in Penghu

1611
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,080
This is the main island of Penghu

1612
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,600
approximate location

1613
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,840
probably at this position

1614
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,920
This is the GPS we passed

1615
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,160
then do the research

1616
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,520
You can find out exactly where these fossils were unearthed here

1617
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,760
The location of the water is here

1618
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,840
All of our locations are detailed

1619
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,960
Latitude and longitude satellite positioning

1620
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,440
Ding Wei, we also think we should do some science

1621
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,960
not just fishermen

1622
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,600
We're going to do some scientific research on these

1623
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,120
Then this is the Captain Red just mentioned

1624
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,080
he is very funny

1625
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,480
He said fishing caught fossils

1626
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,560
One day, a fish will be caught

1627
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:14,960
as look

1628
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,840
So it's a fish, right?

1629
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,760
That's what he caught

1630
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,640
It turns out he can't jump this fish

1631
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:21,520
right

1632
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,920
As a look it's a fossil fish

1633
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,280
so this is very fun

1634
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,360
he is very happy

1635
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,440
Look at the net tied fish caught fish fossils

1636
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,360
that this

1637
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,520
This is fishing

1638
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,200
he has lots and lots of these

1639
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,920
larger than class

1640
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,600
Contains big cattle

1641
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,200
big horse

1642
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,720
these deer

1643
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,280
these bones are very

1644
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:41,520
look

1645
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,080
This is his casual trip to sea

1646
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,040
You can fish so many things up

1647
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,120
These people this is a big

1648
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,000
this may be a

1649
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,840
look at this big buffalo

1650
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,760
This lower goose bone tooth

1651
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,040
Just to see these deer bones

1652
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,440
this is very, very much

1653
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,680
So he has a big warehouse at home

1654
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
a big warehouse

1655
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
my game is highly recommended

1656
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I would like to speak to our Vice President Wang

1657
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Can you buy it?

1658
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
baby

1659
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
he put it in the warehouse

1660
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I really think it's a waste

1661
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
like that

1662
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
This is the Kebao Museum in Taichung

1663
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Science and Security Museum

1664
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
This is when they based on these words

1665
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
recovered

1666
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
you see this is a

1667
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
a grimtooth

1668
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
This is such a high image

1669
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
this thing

1670
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
And this is a German buffalo

1671
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
It's all based on these bones

1672
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
restored

1673
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It's all very big love is not as tired

1674
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
these animals in the past

1675
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
When the Taiwan Strait was still land

1676
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
are in a lot

1677
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
very large number of representatives

1678
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
see this as

1679
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Just a random tune is so much

1680
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So on behalf of the time here is a

1681
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Probably grassland or some woods

1682
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
So the animals at that time were all roaming around here.

1683
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
so why

1684
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
because at that time this

1685
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
northern ice age

1686
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
It's still too cold in the north

1687
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
So the animals are going south

1688
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
So just in Taiwan

1689
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
just a little warmer

1690
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
They have another source of water here

1691
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Forests and grasslands live here

1692
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,240
But these animals are not actually

1693
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,880
its own and at ease

1694
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,120
it has an enemy behind it

1695
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:09,960
what enemy

1696
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,440
there were humans

1697
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,200
humans and animals together

1698
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:13,960
what are these humans doing

1699
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,600
of course it has bad intentions

1700
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,720
to kill them

1701
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,640
to suffer

1702
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,480
Watch carefully

1703
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,240
we are in the bones

1704
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,360
You can find this trace

1705
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,080
What is this trace?

1706
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,040
cut by man

1707
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,600
humans want to cut

1708
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,280
cut off the deer foot

1709
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,840
to be its tool

1710
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,560
as it is clear from here

1711
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,000
This one is on top of this skinny bone

1712
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,400
There are traces of this cut

1713
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,920
It's clearer here

1714
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,000
this is a deer foot

1715
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,960
chopped

1716
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,120
use a sharp tool

1717
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,520
Said to cut off this cut

1718
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,640
So this thing represents

1719
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,760
It wasn't just animals

1720
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,280
there were humans

1721
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,480
Humans at that time

1722
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,360
Well it's this human

1723
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,960
What is the age?

1724
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,800
Well past the Museum of Natural Sciences

1725
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,520
Games that used these painters themselves

1726
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,960
what about his strategy

1727
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,200
It's reversed again

1728
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,680
It was found that at this age

1729
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,600
probably in

1730
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,840
between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago

1731
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,680
such an era

1732
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,800
About 10,000 to 20,000 years

1733
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,960
At most about 30,000 years

1734
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,240
But they have been doing it on the mainland for 40,000 years

1735
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,440
such an era

1736
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:18,120
In this era and just now Dr. Zhang Junxiang

1737
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,400
The age of Peng Huyuan mentioned is very different.

1738
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,600
So it was hundreds of thousands of years ago

1739
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,280
This is 10,000 to 20,000 years

1740
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,640
Then this makes a big difference

1741
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,680
So this problem should not be solved yet

1742
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:32,200
Are those fossils that old?

1743
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,320
So what age is it

1744
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,840
Is it possible to further determine

1745
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,440
This requires the future

1746
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,080
More of these scientific investigations are needed

1747
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,840
So like our underwater valley work

1748
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,320
Currently working on the sea

1749
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,320
We also hope to find

1750
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:48,000
For some more information on this

1751
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,560
At the same time we also seek to understand

1752
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,160
What was its environment like at that time?

1753
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,640
Because it's 80 meters underwater 90 meters

1754
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,840
we can't see

1755
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:00,040
but we can use these deep sea

1756
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,400
What about the equipment for taking pictures?

1757
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,640
Let's observe the sea at that time

1758
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,920
what is it like

1759
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,080
what is its terrain like

1760
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,160
That's what we have to do

1761
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,680
an object of study

1762
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:11,800
then this is

1763
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,320
This is really human

1764
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,160
This is in Fujian

1765
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,280
What about this part of the sea?

1766
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,360
found

1767
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,480
in the Taiwan Strait

1768
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,200
have found this human

1769
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:21,960
this one

1770
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:22,400
Watch carefully

1771
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,360
femur

1772
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,480
This one is old

1773
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,440
this part

1774
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,880
it's a human

1775
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,120
So the rep says

1776
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:28,840
was

1777
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,160
Not just the discovery of tools made by humans

1778
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,000
say cut bones

1779
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,760
And there are also human discoveries

1780
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:37,840
So the rep says

1781
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,840
What about in this sea area?

1782
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,720
About 10,000 to 20,000 to 30,000 years

1783
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,960
Indeed, there are humans

1784
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,200
There are also lots and lots of animals here

1785
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,320
Then this is an animal paradise

1786
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:49,440
Humans are also a paradise

1787
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:49,720
Why

1788
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,840
it has a large number of animals

1789
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:51,880
let it go hunting

1790
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,720
it has a lot of rich food

1791
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:54,840
can live here

1792
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,640
And the south is better than the north

1793
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,160
It should be warmer

1794
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,920
So it was a time

1795
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,500
Now the Penghu Trench

1796
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,000
But it's a very treacherous trench

1797
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,500
But 10,000 to 20,000 years ago

1798
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,500
This is an animal paradise

1799
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,000
a paradise for human beings

1800
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
This is a

1801
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,500
I'll talk about it later

1802
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,500
This is the world of eight-star power

1803
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:21,000
If you take a car from Hualien to Taitung

1804
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,500
Hualien to Taitung

1805
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,000
Or go north from Taitung

1806
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
you drive a car

1807
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
the east coast is very beautiful

1808
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Surrounded by mountains and waters

1809
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Green mountains and green waters

1810
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
very beautiful

1811
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,500
to the middle point

1812
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,500
you will see Eight Star Cave

1813
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,000
Looking around the Eight Star Cave

1814
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,500
The scenery of Baxing Cave is very beautiful

1815
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:45,000
It is also the middle point between north and south

1816
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
so many tourists come here

1817
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
you can take a rest

1818
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
This is Eight Star Cave

1819
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
This area is a small hill

1820
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Then the road goes down the hill

1821
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,480
If you look closely, on this hill

1822
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,120
many holes

1823
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,520
at least near the edge of the fog

1824
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,600
There are several big holes

1825
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:13,200
This hole is very meaningful in terms of geology

1826
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,080
why

1827
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:18,840
Because the formation of this hole is the so-called wave crashing rocks.

1828
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,480
Well, of course, if you look at the beach here now

1829
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,400
How did you hit the stone?

1830
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,800
Actually in ancient times

1831
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,600
especially long ago

1832
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,720
ten thousand years ago

1833
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:30,880
These holes are actually in contact with seawater.

1834
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,560
So it means that the seawater probably started after the update ceremony ended

1835
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:35,840
slowly go up

1836
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,440
And what about this land?

1837
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,800
The land on the east coast will also continue to rise

1838
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,200
because of what

1839
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,120
This happens to be on the Eurasian plate

1840
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,680
And around here on the Philippine plate

1841
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,360
So what about the movement of this plate?

1842
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,840
It also contributed to the improvement of the land trade here.

1843
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:54,840
That is to say, when the rate of increase and the rate of sea level rise

1844
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,760
What happens after the two reach a state of equilibrium?

1845
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:00,000
The waves are constantly crashing against this

1846
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
So these caves form a lot of sea rock caves

1847
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
so there are many caves

1848
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,000
So this cave is certainly formed by some natural factors

1849
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
But then it became a dwelling place for humans

1850
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Ancient humans found this good

1851
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
There is such a hole inside the natural

1852
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Can take shelter from the wind

1853
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Such a place where you can avoid the ocean

1854
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
So it becomes an archaeological site

1855
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
so humans live here

1856
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
So there's a lot left over from his life

1857
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
So thus it becomes a ruin

1858
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
So thus it becomes now a

1859
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Because it is a very important site of the country

1860
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
That's why it's called a national monument

1861
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
At the same time, the Management Office of the East Coast National Scenic Office of the Ministry of Communications

1862
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
It is also listed as a National Specific Scenic Area

1863
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
means it has its importance

1864
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
importance

1865
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
There is also a so-called Baxiandong Visitor Center here.

1866
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
If you go to the east coast to play

1867
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I strongly recommend

1868
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
everyone can stop here

1869
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,600
the scenery is very beautiful

1870
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,600
I think the scenery of our Taiwan

1871
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,600
Especially the scenery of East Korea

1872
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,800
That is, we don't have to travel abroad

1873
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,200
Actually it's good here

1874
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,200
If you can stay here for a few days

1875
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,400
you must be a star

1876
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,800
favorite

1877
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,800
this is a very nice place

1878
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,000
This is very but a pity

1879
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,200
such a nice place

1880
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,200
but none of us know

1881
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,000
Nobody knows

1882
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:23,600
Watch carefully

1883
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,800
Now since Luke opened

1884
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,000
look here

1885
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
There is a car here every day

1886
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Dozens of cars are parked on the side of the road

1887
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,800
what is he doing

1888
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,000
has two purposes

1889
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,400
There is a visitor center here

1890
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,800
To the restroom

1891
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,800
So many people have to go to the toilet

1892
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,800
so that toilet is kept clean

1893
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,800
also keep cleaning

1894
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,200
because there are too many people

1895
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,200
the second

1896
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,800
There is a temple just by the road

1897
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,400
Lingyan Temple

1898
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,600
go in and have a look

1899
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,200
Burning Township

1900
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,800
This is the Eight Immortals Cave

1901
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,800
then left

1902
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,600
or there is a restaurant here

1903
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:56,800
then have a lunch

1904
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,800
then left

1905
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,000
So tens of thousands of people

1906
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,240
this tourist comes here

1907
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,800
But I believe almost no one knows

1908
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,600
This turned out to be a very important archaeological site

1909
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,800
And it's a national monument

1910
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,640
so it's a pity

1911
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,000
So where is the important line from this site?

1912
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,320
This was in the 57th year of the Republic of China

1913
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:19,680
Professor Song Wenxun of National Taiwan University

1914
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:25,520
So he found the culture of the old times over there

1915
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,400
He named it Changbing Culture

1916
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:32,600
This is the senior who was guided by our Shi Yu at that time

1917
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,240
Changbing Culture named by Mr. Li Ji

1918
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,560
So Professor Song did excavations here

1919
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:41,560
Excavations dug up these so-called old times

1920
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:46,680
That was the first time in Taiwan to discover the culture of the old era

1921
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:50,400
Well, at that time, he also made some age determinations.

1922
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,280
Then he discovered that in this era

1923
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,440
Looking at it from here, it is about 5,000 years old

1924
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,840
About 5300 years, 5400 years

1925
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,640
So this is probably about 5,000 years ago

1926
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,400
Only one age is above the tallest cave

1927
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,000
a year unearthed

1928
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
It is called greater than 15,000 years

1929
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,400
but it doesn't know how many years

1930
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,400
The result is that

1931
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,200
Possibly greater than 15,000 years old

1932
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,000
more than 15000

1933
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,600
but how many years

1934
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,200
Because of the limited technology at that time

1935
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,700
So it has no way to understand

1936
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:20,400
so this becomes one big one puzzle

1937
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,500
How old is this White Star Cave?

1938
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,400
According to reason, it is the era of the era

1939
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,000
Should be at least 10,000 years old

1940
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,200
Why is it only 5,000 years old

1941
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,300
And here it is 15000

1942
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,200
how much is it

1943
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,400
How many thousands of years?

1944
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,500
so no one knows

1945
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,900
But after the discovery of Nagahama's English culture

1946
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,700
But it has become one of our Taiwan's history

1947
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,000
very important one

1948
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,300
Take a look at our elementary school textbooks

1949
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,500
middle school textbooks

1950
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,700
Its first one talks about the culture of the period

1951
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,700
Must talk about Nagahama

1952
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:50,200
Nagahama English culture

1953
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,200
But many students ask

1954
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,400
After all, you are not talking about the culture of the period

1955
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,800
would it have been 10,000 years ago

1956
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,600
Why is this place more than 5,000 years old?

1957
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,000
So in the end this 15,000 years is just greater than

1958
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,280
How long have you been looking for it?

1959
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,200
so no one knows

1960
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,920
So it becomes a question mark

1961
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,600
a question

1962
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,000
what about this thing

1963
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
so until a few years ago

1964
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,880
The Ministry of Culture is looking for us

1965
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,320
Hope to do some further research

1966
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,840
investigate to understand

1967
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,560
Because after the 57th year of the Republic of China, Professor Song

1968
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,840
no one does research anymore

1969
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,640
No one has done research for decades

1970
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,520
But the question is still hanging there

1971
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,000
still need to solve

1972
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,080
At that time, Professor Song

1973
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,960
He also made some inductions on Changmin culture

1974
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:32,840
he said first

1975
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:35,080
He said at that time

1976
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,040
There was no farming phenomenon at that time

1977
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,200
At that time, no one was found at this time

1978
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,320
he can recrop

1979
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,880
no agricultural phenomenon

1980
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,400
the second

1981
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,480
these people

1982
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,320
he won't grind period

1983
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:47,960
to be naughty

1984
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,720
Those things are in line with

1985
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,280
A basic definition of the so-called old culture

1986
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,320
Another third is

1987
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,280
Times are all tricks to beat waves

1988
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,440
no grinding period

1989
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,160
It's time to make

1990
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:58,760
then in addition

1991
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,040
It belongs to the entire eastern part of Asia

1992
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,200
as well as the southern tradition called kanfa

1993
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,200
Therefore, cutting gas represents a period

1994
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,400
The kind of felling gas used to chop things

1995
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,200
an industrial tradition

1996
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,200
So it made an induction on the time

1997
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:18,200
This induction is basically correct

1998
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:22,600
But they all lack some more detailed understanding

1999
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,600
This was also guessed by Professor Song at the time.

2000
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,200
Where did Taiwan's product culture come from?

2001
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,200
So he also made some guesses

2002
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,200
So it may still come from most of the South Seas

2003
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,200
In this region of the South China Sea

2004
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,200
So the discovery of this product culture

2005
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,200
It is very important to the history of Taiwan

2006
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:46,200
It is also Taiwan that can push Taiwan's history forward

2007
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,200
earlier time

2008
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,200
But many issues still need to be understood

2009
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,200
to solve

2010
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,200
Especially to understand the human beings of the old times

2011
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,200
then we need more of this information

2012
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,200
So therefore I personally probably just

2013
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,400
It also introduces about from 1997 of the Republic of China

2014
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,960
We also accept this document will

2015
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,760
Now the Ministry of Culture and Taichung publicity entrust

2016
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,800
We also implement a further step to do this

2017
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,920
The Eight Immortals Cave who joined the army

2018
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,280
This research that has been investigating

2019
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,520
we hope to understand

2020
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,880
Of course, we also set a lot of agenda

2021
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,320
to understand further

2022
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,640
to learn about

2023
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:25,280
Then this is that we will do it more systematically than before

2024
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,840
It is our whole team and the process of work

2025
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,880
Work has a SOP process

2026
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,880
We do scientific research

2027
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,200
do research

2028
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,280
then this is

2029
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,600
Then we this after a few years

2030
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,040
The most important first is that we're going to discover new holes

2031
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,480
why now

2032
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:46,280
This was the era of Professor Song Wenxun

2033
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:49,320
the cave he made

2034
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,000
his own cave

2035
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,200
Regrettably

2036
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,200
when the work is done

2037
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,680
what has become of this cave

2038
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,520
into a ready-made temple

2039
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:59,760
A lot of

2040
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,600
After you dug the hole there was a hole there

2041
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,200
It's just right to go in and set up a few lanes

2042
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,600
put a few buddhas

2043
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,600
After the diary has an appointment, it becomes an altar

2044
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,600
a temple language

2045
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:17,600
So almost all the holes above are occupied by these temple words

2046
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,300
Then it will do temple language

2047
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:21,600
while doing some construction inside

2048
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,100
to dig out the soil

2049
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,600
Then put some altars

2050
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,600
So the chair was destroyed again.

2051
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,000
Below is broken even if possible

2052
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:33,400
Therefore, there is probably no way to do further research on these hole sequences.

2053
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,800
So it is necessary to find a new hole sequence

2054
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,600
our part

2055
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,900
So we have to do a survey

2056
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:42,700
so you pay attention

2057
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:46,000
This is our new survey in recent years

2058
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,500
Therefore, quite a few new hole sequences have been discovered.

2059
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,100
this is quite difficult work

2060
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:53,900
Because these holes are not there waiting for you to discover

2061
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:55,400
In fact, you all know that landslides

2062
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,100
right

2063
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,200
landslides

2064
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,400
Especially typhoons on the east coast

2065
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,100
There are many landslides

2066
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Just cover all the caves

2067
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
are full

2068
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
so can't see at all

2069
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
so we're going to find the cave

2070
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Especially thick straight batches

2071
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
plant covered

2072
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
So it's very difficult to keep working

2073
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
especially in many places

2074
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
because it is a wall

2075
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
So it's pretty dangerous to work

2076
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
like here

2077
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
These are very steep walls

2078
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
look for a group of caves

2079
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
But our team members

2080
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
It's all very risky

2081
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
adventure flood

2082
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
So go in and look slowly

2083
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
through some expert methods

2084
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
through some means

2085
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Then put the caves one by one

2086
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
can find out

2087
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
So you can't see part of the cave at all

2088
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
go find the cave again

2089
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
So now it becomes so many caves

2090
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
So this means

2091
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
At that time the area

2092
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
when it was formed in the sea stone cave

2093
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Actually formed a lot of caves

2094
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
at different times

2095
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
because as the crust rises

2096
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
so it slowly

2097
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,560
highly eroded

2098
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,600
like the earliest ones are relatively high range

2099
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,920
Then when the Disk rises

2100
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,600
There is also a range of lower erosion

2101
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,880
Then Disk goes up again

2102
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,000
and erosion further down

2103
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,240
so the higher the cave

2104
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,960
it should be earlier

2105
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,200
then the lower cave

2106
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,280
it will be later

2107
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,280
then this is

2108
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,240
You are big enough to see the tallest cave above

2109
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:18,920
probably here

2110
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,440
Currently found to be about 200 meters high

2111
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,920
about 30 meters down there

2112
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:23,840
30 meters

2113
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,320
represent different times

2114
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,640
The caves formed by these

2115
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,280
this is

2116
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,440
after we found out

2117
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,840
Kangjia Skills of Science and Ancient Science

2118
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,960
Excavation after investigation

2119
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:36,440
why

2120
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,440
you from the bunker

2121
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,520
Information available to you

2122
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:39,760
is limited after all

2123
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,600
you have to dig under it

2124
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,280
Because the artifacts of ancient humans

2125
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:45,960
slowly with time

2126
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,440
buried under the ground

2127
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,280
So you have to go through a scientific

2128
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,560
a systematic approach

2129
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,680
dig your stuff out

2130
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,760
and then be able to do some research

2131
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:57,400
Then these are the ones we choose

2132
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,400
some caves of different heights

2133
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,040
to carry out

2134
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
to dig

2135
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Digs represent different times

2136
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
The connotations in also represent different eras

2137
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
So we work like this

2138
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
This is our different choice of blood

2139
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
different heights for digging

2140
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
from the actual meter

2141
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
The last track is close to the height of 200 meters

2142
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Excavation actions are carried out in different blood movements

2143
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
This is what we're digging

2144
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Very hard

2145
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
inside this move

2146
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Under the ground after punching in

2147
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Often can reach seven or eight meters

2148
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
very deep

2149
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
especially in summer

2150
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
It's airtight inside

2151
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
So our staff worked very, very hard

2152
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
and very dangerous

2153
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
why

2154
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
On top of the hole there will continue to come down

2155
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Because the above will continue to implement

2156
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
so what do our workmates bring

2157
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
with helmet

2158
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Come on, why is the hat being implemented and smashed like this

2159
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
this is a very

2160
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
but very important

2161
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
So in this

2162
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,400
You can find many of these things in it

2163
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,360
As an ordinary person but do not know

2164
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,440
say it's all stone

2165
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,360
We often have many people ask us tourists

2166
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:08,800
what is this

2167
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:09,720
He said no

2168
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,560
We see a lot of seaside

2169
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,480
Nice by the sea

2170
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,960
These stones are from the sea

2171
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,600
Humans at that time picked these stones from the sea

2172
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,520
They choose stones purposefully

2173
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:24,120
Then the stone itself is processed to make its stone tools

2174
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:25,880
So you can see this is

2175
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:28,200
What I just said is that I will get angry

2176
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,680
it uses these pebbles from the sea

2177
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:35,160
Then come here after the wave

2178
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,000
knock down the flakes

2179
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,160
Then there are some seals here

2180
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,520
These seals can have the function of cutting

2181
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,000
or cut hair function

2182
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,240
So probably in the past these humans

2183
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,640
It's actually not like copper and iron now

2184
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,400
It's exactly when it needs to work

2185
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,080
Go to the beach and cut these pebbles and come back

2186
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,560
and then to process

2187
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,560
then do it

2188
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,440
We also did a lot of experiments

2189
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,840
How did this human do it?

2190
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,200
We went to get the stone ourselves

2191
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,940
Knock, knock, wow, I can't knock on that one, my hands are numb

2192
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:05,440
He couldn't knock a piece down. It was very difficult.

2193
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,440
very difficult with this stone

2194
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:10,600
very hard

2195
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,280
Basalt stone is very hard

2196
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:14,080
It's very, very difficult for you to knock it down

2197
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,200
My hands are so skinny I can't knock them off

2198
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,000
Later we experimented with various methods

2199
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,800
Later found a fastest way

2200
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,400
These people just need to drop on the ground

2201
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,200
he actually cracked

2202
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,800
and he cracked beautifully

2203
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,800
Then do local processing on top

2204
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,600
Then these methods will be formed

2205
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,400
That's why we call it the Wrestling Method

2206
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,800
may have produced such a

2207
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,200
This is what we found through our experiments

2208
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,800
such a result

2209
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:46,600
Learn about the technology of human beings making stone tools at that time

2210
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,200
Also we are inside this hole

2211
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,000
have been excavated very carefully.

2212
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
We did it to see that there is a firepit here

2213
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,600
The location of each of these stone tools

2214
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:59,200
This means that human beings in this cave at that time

2215
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,600
just forming

2216
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
It went in when it just came out of the water

2217
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
so we'll find a lot of pebbles inside

2218
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
In addition, they use these pebbles to make stone tools

2219
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
then inside it maybe when hunting

2220
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
There is barbecue grilled food

2221
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
So there's a lot of these fire sugar in the hole

2222
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
So fire sugar make fire sugar A fire sugar B

2223
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
That is to say, the fire sugar is the place where the fire is burned.

2224
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
So here we can find traces of the fire at that time

2225
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
So on behalf of the human beings at that time

2226
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
This so-called time like Mao drinking blood

2227
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
They make stone tools in the cave

2228
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
cook food in it

2229
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
The event of its whole life is its cave

2230
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
then in this hole

2231
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Also found some of this

2232
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
what does this look like

2233
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
just naughty

2234
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
The one in front of it is completely irrelevant

2235
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,000
This is the human race of the New Era, about 3,000 years old.

2236
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
It means that human beings tens of thousands of years ago

2237
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
thousands of years of human beings

2238
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
it will use animals

2239
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,640
come as a residence

2240
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,680
So humans in the past served as nest dwellers

2241
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,240
so tree dwelling

2242
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,520
and cave dwellers

2243
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:09,080
is to use different terrain

2244
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:13,600
living place

2245
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,680
we did too

2246
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:18,600
The chronological analysis just mentioned

2247
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,080
Well now we do quite a bit of this

2248
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,360
In the past in the era of Professor Song Wenxun

2249
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,840
Due to technical limitations

2250
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,240
How many years did he do it

2251
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,880
and the age of doubt

2252
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,280
we pass these

2253
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,480
Our new technological approach

2254
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:32,760
we can do a lot

2255
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,400
Now there are seventies and eighties

2256
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,400
so its overall channel is very high

2257
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,440
from the current age

2258
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,160
The earliest we can reach 30,000 years

2259
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,520
Can reach 30,000 years of data

2260
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,240
Watch carefully

2261
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,240
this is all we have

2262
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,800
Pay attention to our data

2263
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,120
line up

2264
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:50,920
The earliest age here is 30,000 years old

2265
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,160
and then sorted all the way down

2266
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:56,000
Generate a GAP here

2267
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,400
Down from about 5,000 years ago

2268
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,120
down again

2269
01:20:59,120 --> 01:20:59,920
like until now

2270
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Well, what is very beautiful about this age is the data of this age

2271
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
here is very meaningful

2272
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I won't talk about it here because it's another academic question.

2273
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
In fact, this age is probably the earliest at the current location

2274
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
At the current height, the age is about 30,000 years

2275
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Now tell me what I've said so far

2276
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Humans of our Changmin culture, the age of the eight stars

2277
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
about 30,000 years ago

2278
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
So the humans here are probably the earliest

2279
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
up to 30,000 years

2280
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
These are the results obtained so far

2281
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
In addition, we are also concerned about the accumulation of strata in this cave

2282
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Some made this Poxi in great detail

2283
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,000
As a matter of fact this is a cave and these accumulations of this formation

2284
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
this is very interesting

2285
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,000
From the heap we don't just learn that it's a natural process

2286
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Because the cave itself its original

2287
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
here are big pebbles

2288
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
This represents when the cave was formed

2289
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Pebbles from the sea will rush into the hole

2290
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Then slowly began to deposit on the top

2291
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
This deposit may have flowed in from outside the cave.

2292
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
these grades

2293
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
then to the top

2294
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Come back and find that the score is oblique

2295
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
top is flat

2296
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Why? Because it's late in the month

2297
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
maybe a natural disaster

2298
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
earthquake

2299
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
So the hole is blocked

2300
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
After blocking

2301
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
This grade outside

2302
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Only through some very small forces

2303
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Or the force of the water rushing into the hole

2304
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
We found that around 3000 years

2305
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
probably all the holes

2306
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
basically blocked

2307
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
this thing is very

2308
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
let's analyze the soil

2309
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
analyze the rock

2310
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
we can learn

2311
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
A change in the natural environment reflected at that time

2312
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
and natural disasters

2313
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Especially in Baxian East area

2314
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Until now

2315
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
there are many disasters

2316
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
rockfall anytime

2317
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
collapse at any time

2318
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
so this disaster

2319
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Since ancient times, only

2320
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
So this also reflects

2321
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Humans at that time

2322
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Especially we found in the stratum

2323
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
people come and go

2324
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
come and go

2325
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
came again after leaving

2326
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
That this and the natural environment

2327
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
and natural disasters are basically closely related

2328
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Then of course we also want this

2329
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
These data also help us to understand

2330
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Where did these humans come from?

2331
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
In the past, Professor Song Wenxun speculated that it might have come from South China

2332
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
In this regard, we basically do not deny him.

2333
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
But we also considered his possible ties to the south

2334
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
relationship with the Philippines

2335
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
There are many problems

2336
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
We still need to go further to do some discussions

2337
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
The other is our past geology

2338
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I have always wanted to know the address on the east coast of Taiwan

2339
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
The rate of crustal rise is the fastest in the world

2340
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
very fast rise every year

2341
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
We can also take advantage of the heights of the different caves in the Eight Immortals Cave

2342
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
have the exact age

2343
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Let's estimate the address on the east coast

2344
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
What is the rate at which the ground rises?

2345
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
So it's because each of our caves is to me

2346
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
and then its higher level

2347
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
It can be inferred from this aspect

2348
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
rate of increase per year

2349
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Looks like every year from now

2350
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Probably the time when the East China Sea rose was about 7

2351
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,080
Up to 10 mm is quite a fast speed.

2352
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:06,320
So some of us speculate that this is after the customs year

2353
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:09,200
Taitung's Green Island Blue Rain will slowly approach the East China Sea

2354
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:11,280
because he's been sliding

2355
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,200
I'm improving

2356
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,320
So this is the 88 first move

2357
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,240
In fact, since about 30,000 years ago

2358
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,760
Humans live there

2359
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,480
then he will come and go

2360
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,880
It lasted until about 15,000 years ago.

2361
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,880
Finally another group of people came in again

2362
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,000
Then after 3000

2363
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,080
there is another group of people

2364
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,480
So these studies can help us understand

2365
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,160
what about the cave area

2366
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:35,480
The life of these human beings

2367
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,800
And some changes in his culture

2368
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,720
This is our guess

2369
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:42,680
Some states of human life at that time

2370
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,880
Then let's talk about another topic

2371
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,240
This is the farmer who came across the sea

2372
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:48,440
Well, this was just mentioned earlier

2373
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,640
So while we're talking about Conanco

2374
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:53,000
As the one I saw, this dog

2375
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,720
what is this

2376
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,440
It's a dog, isn't it?

2377
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,120
It's so cute as a dog.

2378
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,640
sleep here

2379
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,040
we are normal now

2380
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,540
if dead

2381
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:03,380
Of course our times are different now

2382
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:04,620
now your pet

2383
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:06,380
if passed away

2384
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:07,140
if after death

2385
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:08,860
not only to bury it properly

2386
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:11,020
cremate it

2387
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:12,620
to put in the tower

2388
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:13,580
to confess

2389
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:14,860
someone wants to put it in the house

2390
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,580
treat it like a baby

2391
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:17,900
in ancient times

2392
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:18,940
I usually imagine

2393
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,460
This dog is dead

2394
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:21,420
throw it outside

2395
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:22,460
eat yourself and leave it alone

2396
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:24,220
But in our Tainan Science Park

2397
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:25,580
5000 years of farmers

2398
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:28,020
look at his dog treat like this

2399
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:30,740
he did a very good job of burying him

2400
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:32,220
So after the dog died

2401
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:33,940
so look what he's doing really well

2402
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:34,820
bury it

2403
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:35,500
not a dog

2404
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,580
There are many dogs like this

2405
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:38,700
So this means

2406
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,580
One between man and dog

2407
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:43,540
very close relationship

2408
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:45,500
This is what we have found in Taiwan so far

2409
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:48,940
The earliest dog bred by humans

2410
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:50,580
We call it Taiwan's No. 1 Dog

2411
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:51,940
Ha ha

2412
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:55,060
This Taiwanese native dog is the first dog in Taiwan

2413
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:56,460
We also found it here

2414
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:58,340
this rice just said

2415
01:25:58,340 --> 01:25:59,900
This is the first rice in Taiwan

2416
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,040
The earliest rice found in Taiwan

2417
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:03,840
5000 years

2418
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:07,040
Of course, this era is still later than other regions.

2419
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,240
Like the current era of rice in mainland China

2420
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:10,280
up to 20,000 years

2421
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:12,440
By 19,000 years to 20,000 years

2422
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,320
We have now found the earliest rice in Taiwan

2423
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,760
or until 5000

2424
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,240
Then this millet

2425
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,200
This is the first discovery in Taiwan

2426
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,480
We know that the aborigines of Taiwan have so far

2427
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:23,920
Millet is a very important crop

2428
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,240
Therefore, we must use millet in the new year

2429
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:28,040
Then use millet to make wine

2430
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:29,480
but where did this millet come from

2431
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,800
when did millet start

2432
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,520
never knew

2433
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,600
Now through our archaeological discoveries

2434
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,120
Also found a lot of millet

2435
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,520
This millet does not come by accident

2436
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,200
Or snatched from the sea

2437
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,080
or how

2438
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:42,680
it's a lot

2439
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:44,640
And the millet is all burnt

2440
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,520
The representative said that the amount was very large

2441
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,880
it may burn it when lether

2442
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,800
Just as Lesser's positive attitude towards Fang

2443
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,280
So the representative said that when

2444
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:53,560
this amount is quite large

2445
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:56,520
Not that it takes money to buy very precious

2446
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:57,520
So the rep said

2447
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,960
At that time, a multi-functional representative of human beings

2448
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,800
So on behalf of the agriculture at that time

2449
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,120
it grows rice on the one hand

2450
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,320
grow millet on the one hand

2451
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:05,680
Of course there is a problem

2452
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:08,920
Because millet grows in a more temperate region

2453
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,880
The subtropical zone in our southern Taiwan

2454
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,240
upper tropics

2455
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:13,480
How can millet be produced

2456
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,880
This part is of course also a question

2457
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:18,440
But we also know that climate change

2458
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:21,360
Today's climate may not have been the same in the past

2459
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,040
And the environment in which they were planted was not necessarily the same.

2460
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:26,280
so it is still possible to grow millet

2461
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,080
Now in the tribes of the aborigines in eastern Taiwan

2462
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:30,760
There are many kinds of rice

2463
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:36,880
There are two ruins in the area of ​​Taiwan Academy of Sciences

2464
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,040
one is what we call

2465
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:39,480
This is a Nanguanli

2466
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:40,480
Nanguan Lidong Ruins

2467
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,600
These are the two oldest ruins

2468
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,560
Just five thousand years

2469
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:45,400
It unearthed our first dog in Taiwan

2470
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:47,120
Also produced Taiwan's first grain of rice

2471
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,200
Taiwan's first millet

2472
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,880
This is when we are working

2473
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,600
as look have very hard

2474
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:55,280
This has a large area of ​​excavation

2475
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,400
Then these peasants of this culture

2476
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:58,480
it all comes from

2477
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,400
are from

2478
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
are from mainland

2479
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Probably the coast of Guangdong

2480
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
They are all the generation of the Pearl River Delta

2481
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
because of the culture there

2482
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
These cultures are very similar

2483
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
The representative said that these human beings

2484
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Probably from the Guangdong Delta

2485
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
even further south

2486
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
One North to Hainan Island

2487
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
this coastal generation

2488
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
probably all these people

2489
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
probably his original hometown

2490
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
or these people cross the sea

2491
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
came to these Taiwan

2492
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
this is

2493
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
As a look at his technologies at that time

2494
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
has made great progress

2495
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
very nice these naughty

2496
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Very beautiful these stone tools

2497
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
These stone tools are very delicate as a model

2498
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
And back

2499
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
These backs are used for

2500
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
as a knife for harvesting

2501
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
these rice crops

2502
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
You see this has a very nice back knife

2503
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
As these tools for reaping antiquities

2504
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
And the counterpoint to what I just said

2505
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Made book cover

2506
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
and these

2507
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
It is also sold

2508
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
There are also some sold tools

2509
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
that is its settlement

2510
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,200
a very complete settlement

2511
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:06,200
contains channels

2512
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:07,200
There is a river

2513
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,700
have a house

2514
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:09,700
with stick

2515
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:10,700
The whole is in the settlement

2516
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:12,200
After representing the people at that time

2517
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,200
There is a very stable settlement

2518
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,400
it's not an oily

2519
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,400
Mobility

2520
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,500
After it came to Taiwan from the mainland

2521
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,600
it chooses

2522
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,200
I just talked about the beach near the sea

2523
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,200
live here

2524
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,200
so it does farming

2525
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:28,200
to engage in fishing hunting

2526
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,200
then there is a very good one

2527
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,200
a complete society

2528
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,200
Social Structure

2529
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,200
the whole society

2530
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,200
it for this environment

2531
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,200
can have very good adaptation

2532
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,200
And its position

2533
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,200
Right on top of the sand dunes by the sea

2534
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,200
so the location it lives in

2535
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:47,200
and the habitation of its past continents

2536
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,200
basically something like

2537
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,200
So representing an immigrant

2538
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:52,200
go from one place to another

2539
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,200
He still hopes to maintain

2540
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,200
his original habits

2541
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,200
can also live in

2542
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,200
similar to his living environment

2543
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,200
in this environment

2544
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,400
So in the past on the southeast coast of the mainland

2545
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,600
it lives by the sea

2546
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,600
live in the dunes

2547
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:08,200
Taiwan still chooses sand dunes to live in

2548
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:10,600
This is it also has a cemetery

2549
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,600
from its grave staff

2550
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,000
Has a very complete tomb staff

2551
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
have fixed customs

2552
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,400
The tomb staff of the people here are completely facing south.

2553
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,400
not facing north

2554
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:24,200
So it must be a special custom

2555
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,400
then its source

2556
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:28,500
We speculate that it may have come from the coast of Guangdong

2557
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:29,700
from the south of Fujian

2558
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,300
Get this Hainan strip in the north of Hainan Island

2559
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:33,700
this is its old home

2560
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:36,100
such a source

2561
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:37,700
In fact, it’s not just that we are in Taiwan

2562
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:39,300
to the whole world

2563
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:40,300
also has its significance

2564
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:41,100
why

2565
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:43,300
Because now we are talking about the origin of the so-called Austronesian people

2566
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:44,200
because everyone needs to know

2567
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:47,700
The Austronesian peoples are from the southeast coast of the mainland

2568
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:49,700
and then migrated southward

2569
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:51,000
then to the pacific

2570
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,400
current residence

2571
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,700
these austronesian peoples of the pacific

2572
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:57,000
think a lot of it comes from

2573
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:58,700
from the southeast coast of this continent

2574
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:00,000
and Taiwan

2575
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,640
Then our discovery in Tainan Branch

2576
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:04,080
for such a theory

2577
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,560
has a supporting role

2578
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,360
Of course there are different views

2579
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:09,720
But now the mainstream

2580
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:10,880
is such a mainstream

2581
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,120
So our findings are even stronger

2582
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:14,320
such a view

2583
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,760
Of course we also did it

2584
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,120
According to our own material

2585
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,080
Also made a lot of corrections

2586
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:20,480
this is a

2587
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,640
so we Taiwan

2588
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,640
Its discovery is not just of significance to Taiwan

2589
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:25,760
and has worldwide significance

2590
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,680
tell another story

2591
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,400
stonemason on a desert island

2592
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,560
this is very interesting

2593
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,480
it is this

2594
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,600
This so-called desert island

2595
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,640
Refers to Qingmei Island in Penghu

2596
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:37,560
what time is it now

2597
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:40,200
Ome Island on this deserted island

2598
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:41,920
This island is actually for going to Ome

2599
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:42,920
very beautiful

2600
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:44,200
But it's a desert island

2601
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,880
no one

2602
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:49,000
And the traffic is very inconvenient

2603
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
We are going to Penghu

2604
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,240
all of us are

2605
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:53,840
The deepest impression must be that everywhere is black

2606
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,360
black stones everywhere

2607
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,040
Why

2608
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:58,520
Because there are a lot of basalt rocks here

2609
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:59,560
The basalt is of course harming it

2610
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,200
because it's

2611
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,640
due to address

2612
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:05,440
Because after the past volcanic eruptions in Penghu

2613
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,560
Much of its magma is transported to flow out

2614
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,760
many so-called basalts

2615
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,960
So you can see basalt rocks everywhere in Penghu

2616
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:16,640
Well, this basalt is generally called black stone.

2617
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:19,120
its texture is very hard

2618
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,520
It can be divided into different categories

2619
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,280
A so-called fine basalt

2620
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,240
The other is called subtractive basalt

2621
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,840
Then the texture of this reduced basalt is relatively fine

2622
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,600
The texture of fine basalt is more airy

2623
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:35,240
There are often bubbles that are softer

2624
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:37,560
So these are two different

2625
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:40,080
This form of basalt

2626
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,320
Well, on Qimei's side

2627
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:42,600
mostly reduced basalt

2628
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,720
so its texture is very hard

2629
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:45,600
and meticulous

2630
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,400
This is in Qimei area

2631
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:53,280
Then when the volcano erupted

2632
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,400
After the magma flows out

2633
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:58,680
Its form will produce many

2634
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,360
this so-called contact

2635
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,400
Du Zhuang's end of this phenomenon

2636
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,000
like this

2637
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,480
as watch by the sea

2638
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,080
You can see that it looks like this when you hit the top here

2639
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,920
This is how it looks when you look up close

2640
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,080
very beautiful

2641
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:11,800
This is a kind of duzhuang ending

2642
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:14,720
This is because after the gushing out along the river

2643
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,160
its special shape

2644
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:18,600
a special form of

2645
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:20,680
this condensation

2646
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,240
This warm diarrhea it becomes a

2647
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:24,320
very important ingredient

2648
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,640
Then this ancient man was very smart

2649
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:28,200
it found the stone

2650
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,920
Its texture is very fine

2651
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,240
very hard

2652
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,600
So he thinks this ingredient is

2653
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,120
can be used as an important tool for it

2654
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:36,680
an ingredient

2655
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:37,800
see this as

2656
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:39,640
then until now

2657
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:40,840
These Penghu residents

2658
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,880
Still use a lot of these ingredients

2659
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,160
including construction

2660
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,800
Holy Child Contains Faith Inside Temple

2661
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:46,640
holy children art

2662
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:48,880
It's all a lot of just using this ingredient

2663
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,880
Xuanwu Garden as a look at the buildings that contain it

2664
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:55,280
The twin-heart stone household that contains Sheng Erqinmei

2665
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,880
They also use these big stones from Xuanwu Garden

2666
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:58,920
piled up

2667
01:33:58,920 --> 01:33:59,880
these are works of art

2668
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Therefore, for the residents of Penghu, this Xuanwu Garden

2669
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
is a very important ingredient

2670
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
It is also an important food industry

2671
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,000
So we are in Ome Island

2672
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I did the survey in 1983

2673
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
We will do it when we get to Ome Island

2674
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
just like us

2675
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Go everywhere to find these ancient relics

2676
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
found a large number of these stone tools

2677
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
There are many stone tools

2678
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
very tree very big

2679
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
I was skeptical

2680
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
This stone so many stone tools

2681
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Not many people live on the island

2682
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
why does it have

2683
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
so many stone tools here

2684
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Almost densely packed with stone tools

2685
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
if the population is very small

2686
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
It doesn't need so many stone tools

2687
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
to make tools

2688
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
So I guessed

2689
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
this may have other meaning

2690
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
it may be a factory

2691
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
or as a production and marketing

2692
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
a factory of stone tools

2693
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
So this one finally hits the year 2000

2694
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,000
At that time, I was in the same university as the next one.

2695
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
A Berry Rollade

2696
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
and what we can do

2697
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
a professor's researcher

2698
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,800
Also retired Ye Xuewen Professor Ye

2699
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,960
Let's go to Qinmei to have a look

2700
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,720
take a look

2701
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:07,560
Later, when we arrived at Qinmei, we discovered that

2702
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,920
Sure enough, I found out that my statement was confirmed.

2703
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,400
I found several so-called large

2704
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:13,760
The so-called period factory

2705
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:14,880
What is period factory

2706
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,400
It was the ancient humans

2707
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,760
Every day in the manufacturing period

2708
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,120
A lot of waste will be generated after the manufacturing period

2709
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,640
So pile it on the ground

2710
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:23,400
pile up like a mountain

2711
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:24,640
So it becomes one we call

2712
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:27,840
Besides, I pack a lot of tools of the production period inside

2713
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,320
So this is a period factory

2714
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:31,520
This is our Qin Meidao

2715
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:35,320
Qinmei Island is a very beautiful island

2716
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:36,680
So look at this island is the roundabout

2717
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:38,320
then on this coast

2718
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,400
There are many strong knots

2719
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,360
This kind of Xie Lianzhu who promotes the five words exists

2720
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,440
Here become ancient humans

2721
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:49,360
important field of its choice to real estate

2722
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:51,480
So ancient humans were very intelligent

2723
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:52,520
where do these people come from

2724
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:53,680
from Taiwan

2725
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:55,160
So they came to Peng Hua

2726
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,560
They chose a place to live

2727
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,320
This place is called Nangang Ruins here

2728
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,120
This island seems to be

2729
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,880
It's a place where you can dig the ground and prepare for the wind.

2730
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,720
Because the northeast monsoon in Penghu is very strong

2731
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:07,120
So they chose here to make a settlement

2732
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:08,080
gather here

2733
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:09,880
Then the wind can block the wind

2734
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,360
And then a little village sits here

2735
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,200
What are these people doing?

2736
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:14,000
what is his only job

2737
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,280
Just after going out during the day

2738
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,600
Just to this coastal area

2739
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,640
What about these three places?

2740
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,880
Come and find ingredients

2741
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:21,760
tableware

2742
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,640
So we envy them

2743
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:25,640
Here I live as if it expires American drama

2744
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:27,680
This is Twin Star Ishido

2745
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:28,440
very beautiful

2746
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:30,240
the sea is very beautiful

2747
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:32,240
These people sit there every day and hit stones

2748
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,560
I think they play folk songs and hit rocks for a year

2749
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,200
really sit every day

2750
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:38,040
But it's also boring to think about

2751
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:39,200
but it's very

2752
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:40,960
Then there are several large

2753
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,080
This stone tool factory along the coast

2754
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:45,200
This is what made stone tools at that time

2755
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,360
And what about this part?

2756
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:47,520
watch this

2757
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,000
this is what we did

2758
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,680
This help has also been excavated

2759
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:55,440
Watch carefully

2760
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,680
At that time, I helped so I saw naughty

2761
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:58,640
This secret is crazy

2762
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:00,120
The representative lived here for a rather long

2763
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Then there's a long time here

2764
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Then there are personal ones buried here

2765
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Those who saw people die here are buried here

2766
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
so it's not a temporary

2767
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
it lives here

2768
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
So people are buried here when they die

2769
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
it won't ship back its old furniture

2770
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
buried here

2771
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,000
The representative here is a jade

2772
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
this is a jade

2773
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
The representative said that the jade from Taiwan

2774
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
they can also bring

2775
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Jade

2776
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
This is the era we did

2777
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Dated to 3800 at the latest

2778
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
as early as 4200

2779
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
this era

2780
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
represents 3800 years

2781
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
4200

2782
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
people here at this time

2783
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Living on Ome Island

2784
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
what they do is make stone tools

2785
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I'm going out to see this one

2786
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Most people can't understand these stones

2787
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
I can't even read it the first time

2788
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Later, when I went again, I found

2789
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
There are many mysteries in it

2790
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
inside these stones

2791
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I go out to see

2792
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
It's full of scraps from making stone tools.

2793
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,000
This scrap it doesn't break down naturally

2794
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
it is cracked

2795
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
So from many traces

2796
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I can tell

2797
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,600
most obviously this

2798
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,000
This is called Northwest Bay

2799
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,600
This one is an original manufacture period

2800
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:10,200
after a long time

2801
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:13,000
Then it's left on the ground again

2802
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Various scraps of the period when these were made

2803
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,800
so much waste

2804
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,400
piled up thick

2805
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:22,000
There is almost no natural stone in it

2806
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
They are all scraps from the manufacturing period.

2807
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,800
There are many, many tools from these manufacturing periods in the middle

2808
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,800
The so-called tools are masonry stones

2809
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,000
is to hit stone with stone

2810
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
so there are some tools

2811
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,400
As look here there are many

2812
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,400
this wonderful one

2813
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:40,000
This is probably all over the world

2814
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
To find such a complete period manufacturing site

2815
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,400
almost very hard

2816
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,000
we have some in the pacific

2817
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Mainland China has some

2818
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,800
But an immobile like this

2819
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,600
4,000-year-old

2820
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:52,000
Such a site is probably basically

2821
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,800
one is hard to find again

2822
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:55,600
Because there is Qimei, no one goes

2823
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:56,800
also did not destroy

2824
01:38:56,800 --> 01:39:00,000
So here every year through things

2825
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,340
Spring, summer, autumn and winter go round and round

2826
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:05,340
It's been like this for four thousand years

2827
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:06,540
it's always been like this

2828
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:08,540
so when i look at it

2829
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:10,540
I feel my heart will be excited

2830
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:12,140
I feel that between the ancients

2831
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:14,940
It's the feeling of meeting

2832
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:16,340
Can feel the ancients here

2833
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:18,540
the way you work

2834
01:39:18,540 --> 01:39:20,300
so in my head

2835
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:21,740
can emerge

2836
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:24,940
So this was what shocked me at the time.

2837
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:26,740
this discovery

2838
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:29,940
We have also done a lot of analysis during these periods

2839
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:31,100
found inside

2840
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:32,500
so many stones inside

2841
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,340
In fact, it can be divided into several categories

2842
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:36,060
One category is rock that hits fast

2843
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:37,860
just a stone

2844
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:38,900
they from this

2845
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:41,060
after moving above

2846
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:42,860
to make a knock down

2847
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:44,340
become a crashing stone

2848
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:46,260
Then generate some stone boxes

2849
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:48,540
So the stone box is a mother stone

2850
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:50,420
The above can be further processed

2851
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:52,860
A call to make stone tools

2852
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:54,540
Then come the flakes

2853
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:58,260
Stone flakes are a basic material for further processing

2854
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:00,020
Then it becomes a blank and a material

2855
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,600
Then make a blank in the manufacturing period with the material

2856
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:07,200
And then there are some stone remnants

2857
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:09,600
So remnants are tools

2858
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,000
this stone grass it produces a blemish

2859
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,800
Or it breaks and it's lost

2860
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,200
Because there are too many stone residues

2861
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:16,600
it doesn't need to stay

2862
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:17,500
it breaks and throws it away

2863
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,700
So often found a very beautiful period

2864
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:21,500
But it will be discarded if there is a catastrophe in the middle

2865
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:23,800
Because it is a relatively complete

2866
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:25,000
It is good

2867
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,400
There are also pebbles

2868
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,600
What are stone tools?

2869
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,400
It's a tool to beat the times

2870
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,400
then this is

2871
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:34,800
As a look at this is a so-called stone

2872
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,400
a most primitive stone

2873
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,600
then slowly beat down

2874
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,200
turn into small pebbles

2875
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,400
then come again

2876
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:41,400
this is a flake

2877
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,000
a large square

2878
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,300
or rectangular flakes

2879
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:46,600
and then after the challenge

2880
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:49,300
These stone flakes

2881
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:50,600
Then it slowly took shape

2882
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:51,400
This is a

2883
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:54,200
as a round blank imagining a period

2884
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:55,600
For example, a rectangle

2885
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,300
above is where you can shake hands

2886
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:58,400
Below is a windblade

2887
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,000
It's the wind blade of a utensil

2888
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:00,840
this location

2889
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:01,640
then it becomes

2890
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,800
then slowly take the next step

2891
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:04,840
becomes a

2892
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:06,040
After correction

2893
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:06,840
this fixed

2894
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,880
just a small waste

2895
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,280
smaller waste

2896
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:11,760
and then finally becomes a

2897
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:13,720
a period of formation

2898
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:14,400
everybody look

2899
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:14,960
letter

2900
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:16,920
those people are smart

2901
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:18,160
he ends here he ends

2902
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:19,960
he didn't do it

2903
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,240
why not

2904
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:22,320
he doesn't need to do it anymore

2905
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,520
It is enough for him to ship this back to Taiwan

2906
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:26,120
And then processed after arriving in Taiwan

2907
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:27,440
So he also had this

2908
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:29,480
On the one hand, there is the concept of industry collapse

2909
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:30,720
on the one hand also what

2910
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:32,920
The concept of processing export zones

2911
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:34,560
want to be interesting

2912
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:35,320
when he does

2913
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:35,920
Why

2914
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:38,160
He doesn't want to move the whole rock back to Taiwan

2915
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:40,120
We have to cross the black ditch in the middle

2916
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:41,320
very difficult, right?

2917
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:42,640
even in the qing dynasty

2918
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:44,120
The Han people want to cross the black ditch

2919
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:45,680
Ten people have seven berths

2920
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:47,680
Ten ships have seven berths silent

2921
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:48,880
that they

2922
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,840
don't have to move the boulder back

2923
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:52,600
After he has increased to this level?

2924
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,080
reprocessing in Taiwan

2925
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:55,200
So this is a

2926
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:57,240
The system of people at that time, the wisdom of ancient people

2927
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:58,840
Then this is the tool of his manufacturing period

2928
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,640
This has been hammered in vain

2929
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:03,600
it has been tied

2930
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:04,160
Do you see it

2931
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,720
There was a seal and it was flat

2932
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,720
There are so many things like this

2933
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:09,720
Look at these tools

2934
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:12,800
This manufactures tools at ten kilometres.

2935
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,200
Then we based on these things

2936
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:16,000
we can restore it back then

2937
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,800
Steps in each manufacturing period

2938
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:18,880
can restore it

2939
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,000
one recovered

2940
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,600
Then this is the person we imagined at the time

2941
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,560
how to make period

2942
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,400
This step draws it

2943
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:27,440
see this as

2944
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,080
This is the whole Ome Island

2945
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:31,640
above this

2946
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:33,080
This is where the drama of it falls

2947
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:34,760
Humans sleep here at night

2948
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:35,400
sleep

2949
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:36,800
he goes out during the day

2950
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,880
Go to this location where there is this injection of Xuanwu Garden

2951
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:42,000
then what

2952
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,600
just step on the stone and hit

2953
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:46,440
Watching the sea and singing folk songs every day

2954
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:47,200
then this

2955
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,560
then stop after

2956
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:50,640
Just after forming a batch

2957
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:51,720
then here

2958
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:53,360
It just so happens that this is a bay

2959
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:53,800
bay

2960
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,200
Then it's out to sea

2961
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:58,120
Then it can be shipped elsewhere

2962
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:00,000
Where does this luck go?

2963
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,300
This is one of Japan's era scholars Kokubu

2964
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:03,600
he also studies

2965
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:06,000
He found that in southwestern Taiwan

2966
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,660
From south of Taichung

2967
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:09,500
Probably to the generation of Pingtung

2968
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:11,700
Many wills are unearthed inside the period

2969
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:13,000
Xuan Wuyan

2970
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,300
That's where Xuan Wuyan came from

2971
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:15,700
He presumed it was from Penghu

2972
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:17,300
So he was the first to bring up

2973
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:19,300
So Xuanwuyan in southern Taiwan

2974
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:21,500
is a scholar from Penghu

2975
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:24,400
Now our findings can be further confirmed by

2976
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:25,100
Watch carefully

2977
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:27,800
This is the period of Xuanwuyan in southern Taiwan

2978
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:28,500
Watch carefully

2979
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:29,500
is very beautiful

2980
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:30,100
right

2981
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:31,400
The model is very delicate

2982
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:33,100
This is not available in Penghu

2983
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:33,600
right

2984
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:34,100
Penghu means

2985
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:36,700
After he punched out the fur of the thing

2986
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:37,600
Shipped to Taiwan

2987
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:38,700
and then process

2988
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:40,000
then spread out

2989
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:40,800
So the rep said

2990
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,500
The earliest processing export zone

2991
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:44,700
this

2992
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:45,900
I didn't know if I slept

2993
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:46,900
do not know

2994
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:47,700
then this is

2995
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:48,100
Watch carefully

2996
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:50,100
The period of this stone in Taiwan

2997
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:51,500
are very delicate

2998
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,100
So our hypothesis

2999
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:56,300
Penghu Century Factory

3000
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,300
It is not just the meaning of manufacturing technology

3001
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:00,000
it was at the time

3002
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,200
ancient human trade

3003
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,080
The circulation of the goods

3004
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:05,440
In fact, it also has a very important meaning in it.

3005
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,760
Then this part of its circulation

3006
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:09,160
On the one hand to Taiwan

3007
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:10,520
it is mostly southern taiwan

3008
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,640
It is almost not found in northern Taiwan

3009
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:14,080
from Taichung

3010
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:15,840
South of Zuoshuixi

3011
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:17,920
It has probably been this generation until Pingtung

3012
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:20,840
Another scholar's

3013
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:21,800
Research by foreign scholars

3014
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:23,920
On Dongshan Island in Fujian

3015
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,440
some periods unearthed inside the chair

3016
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:28,440
After some isotopic analysis

3017
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,000
Analysis of trace elements

3018
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,960
It was also found that these things all came from Penghu Island

3019
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,840
So this thing becomes very interesting

3020
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,920
Therefore, the period of Qimei Island in Penghu

3021
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,200
It is not only to Taiwan

3022
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:40,640
It also went to Fujian

3023
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:43,560
So this represents five thousand years in ancient times

3024
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:44,480
four to five thousand years ago

3025
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:46,880
Here is a very important

3026
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:47,840
one place with one meaning

3027
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:49,160
many people ask me

3028
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,000
He said what ship he was on

3029
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,640
It is not so easy to cross the black ditch

3030
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:54,200
I said I'm sorry I don't know

3031
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:55,160
we didn't find

3032
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:57,880
We can only speculate that probably

3033
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:00,040
Because motor boats were impossible at the time

3034
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
may be troublesome

3035
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
to take advantage of the good weather

3036
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
to cross the trench

3037
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
but sea trench

3038
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Although it is about sea trenches

3039
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
It's actually very difficult

3040
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Our School Archeology Team

3041
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Experience crossing the sea trench several times

3042
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
it is very difficult

3043
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
very thrilling

3044
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
So four or five thousand years ago in ancient times

3045
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,000
how do humans carry so many stones

3046
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
How to cross the sea trench

3047
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
From Penghu to Taiwan

3048
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
From Penghu to Fujian

3049
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
This is a big puzzle

3050
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
we all need

3051
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
On the one hand we are wary

3052
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
the wisdom of the ancients

3053
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
On the one hand we are also very

3054
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
how to solve this puzzle

3055
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
ancient humans

3056
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Here is a model we built

3057
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
these are the ingredients

3058
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
between the whole area

3059
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
in trade

3060
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
A model generated

3061
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
this is ours

3062
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
relationship of our time

3063
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
i want the fastest

3064
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
tell me again

3065
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,000
then another

3066
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Sea Wonders

3067
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
we know taiwan

3068
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
You are studying and don't know

3069
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Taiwan is in the whole of East Asia

3070
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
One of the centers of a very important anticipation

3071
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
As long as China is a big country

3072
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
There are several important prospective centers on the mainland

3073
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Hongshan Culture in the Northeast

3074
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Two Groups of Cultures in the South

3075
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
in Hangzhou, Zhejiang

3076
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Then the Gansu area in the west

3077
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,000
are the centers of several important expectations

3078
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Taiwan is one of them

3079
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
is also an important center of anticipation

3080
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
why

3081
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Because there is a bathroom in Taiwan

3082
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Fengtian Field in East Hualien

3083
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
it is a domain

3084
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
thus creating Taiwan

3085
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,000
for thousands of years

3086
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
is a very important anticipation center

3087
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
About five thousand years ago

3088
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Humans have already started using anticipation

3089
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
current expectations

3090
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
In all the ruins in Taiwan

3091
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Both found the expected

3092
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
inclusive from north to south

3093
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
From Main Island to Outer Islands

3094
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
almost all expected

3095
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Just like Green Island and Orchid Island, both have been found and expected

3096
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I remember two years ago

3097
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,000
I went to Green Island to see a ruin

3098
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,000
the surface of the ruins

3099
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:54,000
you can't see anything

3100
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
I see a friend go

3101
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
a foreign scholar

3102
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
His purpose is to find expectations

3103
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Looking for a long time is very disappointed

3104
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
We don't see

3105
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
As a result, when I want to turn back later

3106
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I kicked

3107
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
just kick out a bath gas

3108
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
so he is envious

3109
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
he has medicine

3110
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
i said no

3111
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
This is the heritage of our country's culture

3112
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
you can't take it

3113
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
this

3114
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
We know that the current bath gas in Taiwan

3115
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
very widely distributed

3116
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
this

3117
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I think the relationship of this time

3118
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Most of them are in Taitung

3119
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
transplant

3120
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
it unearthed bath gas

3121
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Much

3122
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Now there are more than five or six thousand pieces

3123
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
unearthed from the same transplant

3124
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
the bath gas itself

3125
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,000
can be divided into several categories

3126
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
One is the so-called decorator class

3127
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Light Drama

3128
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Weapons

3129
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
You can look at these pictures

3130
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
very beautiful

3131
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
The technology of our Taiwan bath gas

3132
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Actually it's not bad at all

3133
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
not bad at all

3134
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
So I speak Haiyu Qipan

3135
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
In Taiwan's Haiyu Barren State

3136
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
inside this corner

3137
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
there are still

3138
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
there is such a beautiful

3139
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
craft of healing

3140
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,000
everybody look

3141
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
The bath gas is very beautiful

3142
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
very beautiful

3143
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
The bath quality is also very beautiful

3144
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
everybody look

3145
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
these are earrings earrings

3146
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
look

3147
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Different kinds

3148
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,400
These II, you see

3149
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:04,600
Compared with the jade aura of the mainland, this is actually true

3150
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:08,700
It really doesn't matter in terms of craftsmanship, craftsmanship, or shape

3151
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:10,000
Actually not bad

3152
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,300
Look at this is very beautiful jade gas

3153
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:14,300
This and this very famous

3154
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:17,200
The so-called life type has a birthday

3155
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:18,200
such two people

3156
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:21,800
This Taiwan has now discovered that there are two or three worlds

3157
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:23,600
Such a kind of jade appears

3158
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:24,200
very beautiful

3159
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:25,800
This is Taitung Stone Statue Red Museum

3160
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:27,200
You take this as its authority

3161
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:31,000
You guys look very beautiful too

3162
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,600
Then this is another site outside the North and South

3163
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:36,800
Also found the same kind of jade gas

3164
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,700
Look at these gems

3165
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:41,700
So Taiwan's jade gas is very exquisite

3166
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:43,300
it has such an important

3167
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:45,500
Ten thousand generations of ancient humans in Taiwan

3168
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:49,600
In fact, there is such a very important tradition of jade

3169
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:51,800
Then this is this is a jade tube

3170
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:53,600
That's a puzzle too

3171
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,800
It can be up to 30 cm in length

3172
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:59,000
Such a long, very narrow, small round tube

3173
01:48:59,000 --> 01:48:59,900
available from this

3174
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,400
can penetrate to the other side

3175
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:02,400
so you use water

3176
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:03,400
This side can be used as a water pipe

3177
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:04,900
can flow to the other side

3178
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:05,900
so this is a puzzle

3179
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:07,400
how did you do it

3180
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:08,900
ten generations before

3181
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:10,900
Well this is on top of the world

3182
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:12,600
It's hard to have such expectations

3183
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:14,100
such a long tube

3184
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:16,500
this is very delicate

3185
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:19,200
And the middle will not be broken

3186
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:21,200
And penetrate

3187
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:23,600
This craft is very rare

3188
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:26,400
This section has been a few months ago

3189
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,800
Implemented as national security by the Ministry of Culture

3190
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:32,200
This is the expectation of the national security level

3191
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:35,200
this is very beautiful these

3192
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,600
This pre-value is very good pre-value

3193
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:37,600
you want to do this

3194
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:38,800
I want everyone to take a look

3195
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,600
Then this expected mineral source

3196
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,400
The only source of minerals in Taiwan is here

3197
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:44,900
In the so-called Toyota domain

3198
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:46,500
Well, recently our colleagues are here

3199
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:47,500
also do research

3200
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:50,000
Several new ruins were discovered

3201
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,100
near here

3202
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:52,900
Anyway, here is a mining area near here

3203
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:55,900
So a lot of the anticipation is coming from this area

3204
01:49:55,900 --> 01:49:57,900
what is expected of its production

3205
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,300
not just to north and south

3206
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:00,400
North-South is a consumer

3207
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,200
Then he actually changed his steps to Taiwan from high to low

3208
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:06,600
From the main island to the outer islands, the whole island is

3209
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:09,000
So on behalf of a trade network about expectations at that time

3210
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
It's a big trade network

3211
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Thousands of years ago, these beautiful expectations of human beings

3212
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
circulates throughout this

3213
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
But apart from Taiwan

3214
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
In fact, more importantly

3215
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
This is this, this, this, this, this, this, roe

3216
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
This wind is called Hirabayashi roe

3217
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,000
i want to take a look

3218
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
This one has a lot of manufacturing expectations on top of the roe

3219
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,000
leftover scrap

3220
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
You see he was making an expectation

3221
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,000
he wants to be round

3222
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
He can't be cut with wire now

3223
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,000
He cut it piece by piece like this

3224
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
look over there

3225
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
After the corners are cut slowly

3226
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Then grind it into a round

3227
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,000
It's a waste of work

3228
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
But he made so many expectations

3229
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
It means that apart from the tools at that time

3230
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Maybe there was a lot of manpower at that time, and he looked like this

3231
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
So so create these expectations

3232
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Well, this is how to make

3233
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Our scholars have done a lot of research in this area

3234
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
how to make these expectations

3235
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
how to use

3236
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,500
Then the other is the expectation

3237
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:03,500
Not only in Taiwan

3238
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:05,000
one of my students

3239
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,500
he did research

3240
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:08,500
He expected Taiwan

3241
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,500
do some component analysis

3242
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:11,500
him and the philippines

3243
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:12,500
and Thailand

3244
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:13,500
and analysis done elsewhere

3245
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,500
Found in Vietnam and Thailand

3246
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:17,500
Thailand's Indochina Peninsula

3247
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:19,500
Southside has some expectations

3248
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:21,500
Almost from Taiwan

3249
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:23,500
Feng Tian from Taiwan

3250
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:24,500
Then the scientist

3251
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:26,500
our geoscience institute

3252
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:27,500
Dr. Zong Fan

3253
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:29,500
He also helped out with some testing.

3254
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
found that it looks from the ingredients

3255
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,500
From the characteristics it seems

3256
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:34,500
In fact, in many places in Southeast Asia

3257
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:36,500
Expected to be from Taiwan

3258
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:38,500
Therefore, on behalf of Taiwan, these expectations at that time

3259
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:41,000
It is not only circulated in the islands of Taiwan

3260
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Main Island Outer Island

3261
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,000
also spread out

3262
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
like arriving in the philippines

3263
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Arrive in South Vietnam

3264
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Also to the south of Thailand

3265
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
So the range is very wide

3266
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000
this thing

3267
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
can make us go very wow

3268
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
The wisdom and abilities of the ancients

3269
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
this is

3270
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
did these scientific analyzes

3271
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,480
To show what is expected of Taiwan and surrounding areas

3272
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:05,080
Expected Relationships in Other Regions

3273
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:08,760
This is what the entire expectation finds

3274
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:10,000
such a zone

3275
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,680
Because Taiwan has always been very popular

3276
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:14,080
we can forget about it

3277
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:16,400
so

3278
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:17,800
Well, my relationship at this time

3279
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:20,680
I'm probably past the time

3280
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:22,640
So so our archeology

3281
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,120
Research on ancient humans in Taiwan

3282
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:25,800
In fact, through archaeological research

3283
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:29,080
In fact, it broadens our horizons for Taiwanese

3284
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:30,680
we are not living at home

3285
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:32,080
Our current Taiwanese

3286
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:34,000
Taiwanese have tens of thousands of years of history

3287
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,040
continue history

3288
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:36,000
then this help

3289
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,880
Now we can take people from Taiwan

3290
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:39,960
It can also be from 30,000 years to 400 years

3291
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:41,720
can be divided into many different paragraphs

3292
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:42,880
people of different ages

3293
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,320
then this is a chronology

3294
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:45,280
This is my personal build

3295
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:46,240
as can be seen

3296
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:48,040
The earlier the more simple

3297
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:48,920
it's getting late

3298
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:50,600
The more culturally differentiated

3299
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:52,720
in different regions for different cultures

3300
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:56,120
Representing cultural diversity

3301
01:52:56,120 --> 01:52:58,280
this so from these things

3302
01:52:58,280 --> 01:52:59,960
We can find a common

3303
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
similarity locus

3304
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
The first one is Takuko outside Atom Island

3305
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,500
All cultures from ancient times to the present

3306
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:08,000
It has been from outside the island since 30,000 years ago

3307
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Came here from Southeast Asia

3308
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
The second is the expansion of the interior of the coast

3309
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
are slowly expanding from the coast to the inland

3310
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
like early prehistoric times

3311
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
or Han Chinese

3312
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
That is, from the coast to the inland slowly

3313
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
expand slowly

3314
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
another third

3315
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Diversification of Taiwan's terrain and environment

3316
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Therefore, a lot of local environment-adapted

3317
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,000
these cultures

3318
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,000
The appearance of different cultures

3319
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
So represent a very full kind of

3320
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Variety of Ecological Adaptations

3321
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
diversity

3322
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
The fourth is the island of Taiwan

3323
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
So since ancient times

3324
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Coastal trade is an important

3325
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
you see from thousands of years ago

3326
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Anticipated Hanwai Interactive Transactions

3327
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Until the era of popular sentiment

3328
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Trade between Taiwan's aborigines and Han Chinese

3329
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,000
It was Penghu and the main island four or five thousand years ago

3330
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:08,000
In fact, this maritime transaction has always been a very constant behavior pattern

3331
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
sorry

3332
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Finally, we give some enlightenment to the Taiwanese

3333
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,000
What kind of enlightenment do we get from these studies?

3334
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,000
The first one is the favorite small island marine military area

3335
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Taiwan is a small island, but in all directions

3336
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
These people can come to Taiwan from all directions

3337
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
keep coming in waves

3338
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
first come first serve

3339
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
The third is the continuous development of the sea railway

3340
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Taiwan's topography and landforms are constantly changing

3341
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
But human beings have nothing to do with adapting to the environment

3342
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,000
It can continue to develop from nearly ten thousand years to the present

3343
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Then Bilu men and women actually have success

3344
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
It's all worked out

3345
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
look at ancient life

3346
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
It has to adapt to the environment

3347
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Utilize the best strategies

3348
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
and get the best life

3349
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,000
and until now

3350
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
so finally

3351
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,240
I have some thoughts

3352
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:04,200
In fact, we feel that what we just saw on the first page

3353
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:06,960
Many people are arguing about who is Taiwanese.

3354
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:09,040
Looking at it online, I think some are ridiculous

3355
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:10,120
really ridiculous

3356
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:10,920
there is bullshit

3357
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:12,880
or some are simply stubborn

3358
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:14,120
or how

3359
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:17,560
In fact, I think we don't need to spend time fighting over who is Taiwanese.

3360
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:19,400
In fact, from these ancient people

3361
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:21,120
experienced history looks

3362
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:24,000
The people who live and work hard on this land are Taiwanese

3363
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,200
these ancient ancients

3364
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:29,960
You can see that they slowly reproduce his descendants in this land bit by bit

3365
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:31,960
then until now

3366
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:34,480
where especially in today's global competition

3367
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:35,720
Era of not advancing or retreating

3368
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:38,800
Should we Taiwanese not be able to disagree?

3369
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:42,280
Our Taiwan now looks more and more regressive

3370
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:46,600
Well, this is a very boring psychology.

3371
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:48,640
Recently our Ma Ying-jeou is also bored

3372
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:49,520
it's definitely boring

3373
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:50,680
Because Taiwan is not progressing

3374
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:51,760
Make everyone the most bored

3375
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:53,520
So I hope everyone will come together to disagree

3376
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:54,080
OK

3377
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:54,720
thank you all

3378
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:55,160
Thanks

3379
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:05,000
There are only five minutes left for Mr. Zhang's wonderful service and protection.

3380
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
But we allow three problems

3381
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,000
First

3382
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,000
there is a third

3383
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
that's all

3384
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Thank you, teacher

3385
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Super wonderful speech

3386
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Do not know at all

3387
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Archaeological lectures will be so passionate

3388
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
and so funny

3389
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
what i want to ask is

3390
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
One of the places I'm most interested in is

3391
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Questions about the first dog in Taiwan

3392
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
The teacher just mentioned that

3393
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,000
The first dog in Taiwan was buried well

3394
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
say with common imagination

3395
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Dogs may die in some villages

3396
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Just throw it away, it doesn't seem to be the same

3397
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
But you just mentioned that

3398
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
These people should be from South China

3399
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
They are also used to coming from South China

3400
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Want to keep their original village habits

3401
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Because after all the environment is also similar

3402
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
But if they are in their hometown

3403
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
The general imagination is to throw the dog away

3404
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Then why do you love dogs so much when you come to Taiwan?

3405
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
mean the dog they brought

3406
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
So the feeling is very good

3407
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
or in the hometown

3408
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
the dog they brought

3409
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
So the feeling is very good

3410
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Or the dog in Taiwan

3411
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
The special reason they feel getting along

3412
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,600
Or, does the teacher have some explanations for this place?

3413
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,400
That is to say, he seems to be

3414
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:08,600
Or the part that seems to be different from the original imagination

3415
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:09,100
Thanks

3416
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:11,600
Because I don't know how they are in the opposite corner of South China

3417
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:13,000
Maybe it's fun too Maybe

3418
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:13,800
do not know

3419
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:19,600
Then this is indeed what we can see from our archaeological phenomena

3420
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:21,400
it is so

3421
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:26,900
This is a dog, look at this, it deliberately buries its smoke

3422
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:29,400
And then let it go to sleep

3423
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:30,500
It's not good to throw it away

3424
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:31,500
I take good care of the door

3425
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:33,300
between human and dog

3426
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:35,200
I think the whole society at that time

3427
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:36,800
Dogs are very important to their upbringing

3428
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,100
He was hunted and mutilated

3429
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:38,700
Probably

3430
01:57:38,700 --> 01:57:40,900
But Nianwei must be the number one dog in Taiwan

3431
01:57:40,900 --> 01:57:41,700
so far

3432
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:44,900
Doctor Zhang, please

3433
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:47,200
That year when you mentioned that it was the Changbing culture

3434
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:49,400
It is now found to be almost 30,000 years ago

3435
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:52,500
After that, there was another fault for a while

3436
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:53,900
Then why is there a fault

3437
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:57,500
Are the two faults the same?

3438
01:57:57,500 --> 01:57:59,300
democracy

3439
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,400
The next time is according to the present time

3440
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:04,320
We are now Taiwan's aboriginal Gao Shanzhu

3441
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,800
Or it doesn't seem to have anything to do with those

3442
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:07,760
why is this

3443
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:12,560
We are still studying this issue

3444
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:13,760
I am now a preliminary

3445
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:16,960
I had a speech a while ago and I also mentioned

3446
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:18,120
This gap is obvious

3447
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:19,240
From about 15,000 onwards

3448
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:21,720
The next session will be about 6000, 5000 years

3449
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:23,520
There is a GAP in the middle like this

3450
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:24,760
Then this GAP

3451
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:26,920
it's on culture

3452
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:28,720
It has basically not entered the new era

3453
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:31,080
So its period is still typed

3454
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:32,120
hardly naughty

3455
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:33,520
not like this

3456
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:35,080
but it has some differences

3457
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:36,720
it has many tricks

3458
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:38,080
so fake

3459
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:39,920
This real cheat is playing

3460
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:41,840
Use real deception instead of verification

3461
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:42,840
in this way

3462
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:45,720
I'm making a preliminary guess about this

3463
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:47,800
The same culture is actually more than just long soldiers

3464
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:50,800
It was also found once in several places in southern Taiwan

3465
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:52,400
my bold guess

3466
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:54,720
This is similar to that of many tribes in Taiwan in the past

3467
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:57,080
a legend little black person like relationship

3468
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:59,800
Well, this thing is very similar to the Philippines

3469
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,800
Now five or six thousand years ago there were still little black people

3470
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:04,680
Taiwan is in many tribes

3471
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:06,880
There are also legends about little black people in the aboriginal tribes

3472
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:08,520
In the end it was obviously Saisiyat

3473
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:12,200
It doesn't matter between these little black men

3474
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:13,840
I think it's worth thinking about

3475
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:17,480
So recently I was also discussing such a question

3476
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:22,200
Because the aborigines in Taiwan are pushing up

3477
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:24,360
Pushing it to 2000 will not make it up

3478
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:29,080
But in many tribal legends

3479
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:31,280
There are many, many legends with little black people

3480
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:32,840
dwarf legend

3481
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:35,680
The legend but now the dwarves are gone

3482
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:37,880
Is it possible that this thing is such a group of people?

3483
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:39,080
from the Philippines

3484
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:41,640
This part I'm here for a bold

3485
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:43,280
currently it is a guess

3486
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:45,320
Maybe we need to go further and do some discussions

3487
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:47,880
But between the CAP of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the longevity culture

3488
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:51,560
It should have nothing to do with the ethnic group.

3489
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:52,280
in this way

3490
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:53,760
Okay, thank you

3491
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:54,520
There is also a problem

3492
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:55,640
consult

3493
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:57,520
Ask Professor Zhang

3494
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:00,080
Just saw that in the picture

3495
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
That front tooth is missing

3496
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:06,000
The professor said it was

3497
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Aboriginal people have this tooth extraction custom

3498
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,000
then ask the professor

3499
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,000
How can there be such a tooth extraction

3500
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
What does it mean

3501
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,000
right this this

3502
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,000
like what is a needle

3503
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
yes this is actually

3504
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,000
in time era

3505
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
this tooth extraction practice

3506
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
eastward across the continent

3507
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
down from Shandong

3508
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
This is available in Taiwan

3509
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Many can be found with the practice of tooth extraction

3510
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,000
aborigines until now

3511
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
like the strugglers

3512
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
there will be many more

3513
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,000
until now no more

3514
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,000
at least until the sun rises

3515
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
There is also the custom of tooth extraction

3516
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Then this is in a biological theory

3517
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Well like some of you grown up

3518
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:46,000
He is going to use the adult theory

3519
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,000
in this way

3520
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Some are in a special

3521
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
under this requirement

3522
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,000
like military exploits

3523
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Or the girl is an adult

3524
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
he will also pull teeth

3525
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Then we are within the will of Taiwan

3526
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
also found

3527
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,640
In some tribes, all boys have their teeth pulled

3528
02:01:03,080 --> 02:01:05,040
But in some tribes, both boys and girls pull their teeth

3529
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:08,200
So it represents the customs and habits of each tribe

3530
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:10,680
basically different

3531
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:12,480
Of course tooth extraction will hurt

3532
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:13,440
no pain

3533
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:15,400
its habit like we used to

3534
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:18,080
This woman like the Chinese wants to have small feet

3535
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:19,400
It hurts to have too small feet

3536
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:19,840
right

3537
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:20,800
she never had small feet

3538
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:23,120
she became a custom

3539
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:24,480
everybody do this

3540
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:26,080
You feel a shame if you don't pull your teeth

3541
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:27,520
don't pull your feet

3542
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:29,000
that's a shame

3543
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:30,160
So this becomes a

3544
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:31,840
a customary habit

3545
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:32,600
a ceremony

3546
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:34,040
so she has to follow

3547
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:35,800
a constraint of such a culture

3548
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:36,280
in this way

3549
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:38,200
this is incredible

3550
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:39,440
Thanks

3551
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:41,960
it's raining today

3552
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:43,800
Thank you very much for being so active

3553
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:46,280
Archeology is hard work

3554
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:48,480
and requires cross-disciplinary knowledge

3555
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:50,440
In fact, a lot of natural science knowledge is needed

3556
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:52,040
and really hard

3557
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:53,680
It's hard to get a little knowledge

3558
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:55,680
I remember that Mr. Zhang wanted to

3559
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:57,600
Ask me to see the Eight Immortals Cave Ruins

3560
02:01:57,600 --> 02:01:58,440
I see so high

3561
02:01:58,440 --> 02:01:59,920
I'm going to do it for so long and dare not say

3562
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,020
But they are walking on flat ground

3563
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:06,320
The quantitative guide that Mr. Chen Zhongyi talked about last time is also

3564
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:08,320
The first two graduates who are both very tall

3565
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:10,320
so it's really not easy

3566
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:12,140
organize an archeology

3567
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:16,260
The test pile with Master Jing is like Master Jing's army

3568
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:18,260
It's really like Jing Ye's army

3569
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:20,460
There are many different kinds of people

3570
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:24,800
Like those post-production studies on the Nanke site

3571
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:27,500
It's all in that railway warehouse.

3572
02:02:27,660 --> 02:02:29,860
Various charts in the large warehouse

3573
02:02:29,860 --> 02:02:31,860
just wow like forming an army

3574
02:02:31,860 --> 02:02:33,860
Be prepared to be romantic like a lamp stove

3575
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:35,860
So this is very complicated and very hard

3576
02:02:35,860 --> 02:02:37,360
It is not easy to gain some knowledge

3577
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:39,860
We thank Academician Zhang for his wonderful speech today

3578
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:40,860
Thanks
