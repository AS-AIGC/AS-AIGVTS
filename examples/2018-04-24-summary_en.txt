This film mainly discusses the application of statistics in earthquake risk assessment, case-control study, EM algorithm and Kaplan-Meier curve, etc., and emphasizes its importance in public health, medicine, epidemiology and other fields. The video mentions how earthquake engineers use the EM algorithm to analyze surface acceleration for earthquake risk assessment and seismic design, and introduces the wide application of Kaplan-Meier curves in the biomedical field. At the same time, research by statisticians on reducing sampling error has also received attention. The film focuses on the challenges of big data in data integration and analysis. Taking the National Health Insurance Database and the National Health Survey as examples, it explains how to combine big data and fine-grained databases for analysis, and use probability and statistical methods to reduce sampling errors and improve forecasting Accuracy. This video introduces the excellent performance of the EM algorithm, which can handle missing values ​​reasonably and obtain valid results. Attention should be paid to the amount of variation in data fusion, and seismic data should be considered to describe the variation factors of seismic paths. The EM algorithm can improve the maximization and optimization of the objective function, but the calculation complexity is high, the convergence speed is slow, and it depends on the initial parameters. The E-EM algorithm needs to rely on the initial parameters to make assumptions, and the strength of the new interval has little influence; the new interval can be calculated after convergence. Finally, I would like to remind you that the next Knowledge Feast will be held on May 29th. Distinguished researcher Wu Shixiong will give a lecture on the topic of "the relationship between sugar molecules and life". ,
