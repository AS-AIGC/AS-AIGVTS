🎵

2
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,720
The Fall Education takes two

3
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,960
As the19 month is over

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,920
impress many welcome each other

5
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,700
Kings

6
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,880
Playing

7
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,100
down

8
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,400
civil

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,080
movie

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,500
then

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,160
It means that you all have a speech in your hands.

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,160
Of course you can take a look first

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,160
and after listening to the speech

14
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,660
you go back and read it again

15
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,660
Then there will be a deeper experience

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,840
You only need to understand when you go back

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
understandable words

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,840
That's very rewarding

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,340
content of that speech

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,540
I will be introduced by teacher Wang Yuling

21
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,540
at the beginning

22
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,540
I still put his simple travel law

23
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,540
with his glorious deeds

24
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,540
Give you a brief introduction

25
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:43,540
Dr. Wang Yuling came to the Department of Physics in 1979 and graduated

26
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,540
Then after graduation

27
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,540
to the University of Chicago in 1988

28
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,540
PhD in Physics

29
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,540
Then go to the famous Vel Lab in the United States

30
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,540
to do postdoctoral research

31
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,540
Come back and join us in 1991

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Original branch Re-researcher To researcher To current specific researcher

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,500
He has performed very well all the way

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,000
In terms of research he has two main themes

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The first topic is the surface of the rice

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The mechanism underlying the formation of this surface structure

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In this regard, he said that in the particle of Naimi

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
has its specific shape and number

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Call this Magic Class

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is a very strange group of people

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is the basic research

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It has also received a lot of affirmation

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
For example, this domestic outstanding talent talks about doing

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Youyang Technology

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,340
I want to do a meeting of the Chinese American Physical Society

46
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,640
American Physical Society Meetings, etc.

47
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,140
What about the second research direction?

48
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,940
Is the material resistant to this result of imitation

49
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,940
Especially in this Yangji Yanghua

50
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,240
Anti-fear materials in Yang Ji's Yanghua

51
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,140
Then this and this and these two

52
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,640
The second one is related to what I'm going to talk about today.

53
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,680
After glutinous rice is afraid of moving materials

54
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,540
can turn some metals into some

55
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,040
That neat arrangement

56
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,280
Then use this to do the next step with this and use

57
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,040
That part of the research results

58
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,140
Also received a number of awards

59
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,880
Like the Executive Yuan Science and Technology Contribution Award

60
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,740
The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Difficult Technology Industry Gold and Silver Awards, etc.

61
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,640
In addition to his research

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,780
Also contribute to academic administration, which is what we call service academic sociology

63
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,500
He used to be a senior member of the National Science Department of Physics

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,640
There are also two directors of the hospital who broke up with the hospital, etc.

65
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,360
The topic he talked about today is very interesting

66
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,520
Help us listen to the sound from bacteria with Laimi Optical Art

67
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,020
Our warm applause welcomes Laimi Optical Science

68
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,920
Thank you, President Peng, for the invitation

69
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,120
Thank you very much for the long introduction

70
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,520
I speak on many occasions

71
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,520
No one has ever told so much about my not-so-honorable past

72
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,820
Before I came here today, I was actually very, very cautious

73
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,820
Because I probably told you that if you want to give such a speech, you must be legendary.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,280
tie

75
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,860
so my tie is here and my suit is here

76
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,660
everyone to see the proof

77
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,460
After a few minutes, it still looks like this

78
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,020
Then when I came in, I saw the curator Angel wearing this

79
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,580
I'll just take him off and leave him here like this

80
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,660
I'm really, really honored today

81
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,960
I have such an opportunity to talk to you

82
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,060
Borrowing this night, everyone should be watching that

83
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,860
Is it time to turn around or something?

84
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,140
come here everyone

85
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,180
Let's talk about some science

86
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,220
interesting things above

87
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,320
That just left the stage and mentioned to me

88
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,940
This time should be reserved a little more for the following questions, which should be more exciting

89
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,220
so i'm going to talk

90
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,020
20 minutes to fix it

91
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,320
That

92
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,860
because I saw

93
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,140
Because there are some colleagues in there who are experts

94
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,460
Because I'm actually a person who doesn't understand biology at all.

95
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,240
Then I suddenly talk about video here

96
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,600
It's actually something that scares me a little.

97
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,900
But like these two pictures

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,940
What I see here are bacteria, red snowballs, and rice-resistant liquid.

99
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,940
I will introduce you step by step

100
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,540
I hope that the youngest kid who is doing this can understand what I say

101
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,160
Then I'll go ahead and talk about it

102
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,440
but good

103
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,780
Before I talk about it, I want to introduce what is the original branch cable

104
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,340
Because I am in this original branch

105
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,680
Everyone has heard it, but they don't know what the original branch cable is

106
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,240
This word will really disappear

107
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,540
There is still a level above

108
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,100
its first half is also missing

109
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,940
this place

110
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,220
The reason lies in

111
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,020
National Taiwan University campus

112
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,620
It is not the original separate cable

113
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,780
This is very important, because once there was an English translation and then it came back and translated the original content for us.

114
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,380
That is to say, it is the history of the original division, which is the original division.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,500
I want to explain to you first

116
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,240
Yuan Tianchun is in the Zhengdong room of the National Taiwan University campus

117
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,200
Later that year

118
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Dean Peng's Department of Chemistry at National Taiwan University

119
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,600
Take down the old building

120
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,200
let's settle there

121
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,640
Because Dr. Yuan Ze

122
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,940
When Academician Yuan Ze was teaching at Bote University

123
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,340
He came back to promote in Taiwan

124
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,500
Hope to establish the research of atomic and molecular science

125
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,940
Atoms and molecules are not originally separated

126
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,040
in this way

127
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,240
The study of atoms and molecules

128
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,100
Why set up in Central Research

129
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,580
actually you talk about it

130
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,940
Atoms are talking about physics

131
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,800
Molecules talk about chemistry

132
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,580
So the original branch is actually

133
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,140
Institute of Physical Chemistry in Central Research Institute

134
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,440
That is, we have two

135
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,880
big brother or big sister

136
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,140
sandwiched here

137
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,300
we're going in the canyon

138
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,800
the whole survival place

139
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,140
was sent to National Taiwan University

140
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,880
So it looks like it was originally separated.

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,460
The first point is inside the campus of National Taiwan University

142
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,140
It is on the small and medium East Road in their Taiwan University campus

143
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,140
National Taiwan University Tourism Bureau

144
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,140
If you go to the National Taiwan University campus

145
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,020
We have a National Taiwan University campus that has become very beautiful now

146
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,020
It's worth seeing

147
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,520
has a nice seat

148
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
In fact, there are many scenery at night

149
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,020
It's all worth sharing with you

150
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,020
Then you'll see a landmark over there

151
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,020
There is a sculpture beside the game board

152
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,020
The name of this sculpture is Dot

153
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,020
a chance to wait if someone asks me

154
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,520
I'm explaining to you what I call a point

155
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
it's me

156
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,520
A sculpture I raised for fundraising when I was in office

157
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,520
I think it is the most beautiful sculpture on the campus of National Taiwan University

158
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,520
is my biggest

159
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
The greatest contribution to this artifact

160
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
so i have to tell

161
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,520
This matter welcomes the young friends here to go there to talk about love

162
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
Then go there to take wedding photos

163
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,520
This is my artistic wish

164
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,520
Then my current director is Professor Zhou Meiying

165
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520
see you next time

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,400
In fact, a very stable theoretical physicist

167
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,320
he was originally in america

168
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,400
Chair of Georgia Tech's Department of Physics

169
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,200
After the end of the five-year tenure of the department chair

170
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
He'll come back and pick me up

171
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,840
Become Academia Sinica

172
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,560
number one since the original

173
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,520
Director of your tree pear group

174
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,600
is a founder

175
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
just tell you

176
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,200
Heritage water has one great benefit

177
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,520
Heritage Water Does Not Discriminate

178
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,080
is also very important

179
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,760
Our director is also this year

180
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,440
very important one

181
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,560
She is an outstanding female scientist in Taiwan

182
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,480
Then this year's Taiwan female outstanding scientist

183
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,280
so i stop here

184
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,560
That is, when the advertising time of the original committee is over

185
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,800
Aim does not want to be in this young friend

186
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,680
I have the opportunity to go to the original commission to fall in love

187
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,520
in this way

188
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,760
good

189
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,920
Then what I'm going to talk about today

190
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,080
Just now the vice president has read

191
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,960
I won't talk about it in particular

192
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,600
I hope to take this opportunity to convey a lot to you

193
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,100
In fact, it is very unfamiliar to the general public.

194
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,400
For example, when I heard Lai Nv

195
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,000
Some people say that Lai Nv still has sex with Charity Girl

196
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,400
Or it's not the same in the female tour group or something like that

197
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,600
that optical technology

198
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,400
then listen to the sound of bacteria

199
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,500
My original version had no parentheses

200
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,800
Then I thought it was dangerous

201
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,000
Because there are experts out there

202
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,900
Wait a minute to get out by my co-workers

203
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,300
Fix it again and say you are cheating on this and that

204
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,000
It's not right to ride a cheater

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,700
So I just bracket it like this

206
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,500
That's a laser light over here.

207
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,300
and then after passing through a bacterium

208
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,700
Then this bacterium is

209
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,900
The fungus shells are attached to a Lai's silver array

210
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,300
Then you this is an aperture laser light

211
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,200
After photographing and passing through

212
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
And then that laser light comes in

213
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,600
is a green light

214
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,400
go out and become a

215
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,900
Turn into a shade, turn into yellow light and go out

216
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,700
Then we go to detect that light change

217
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,000
then i can tell you

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,100
In fact, who is this matter with?

219
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
the sound is very close

220
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,740
We rely on measurements like this

221
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,740
Another picture is

222
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,740
Similarly this array above

223
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,740
I

224
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,940
After laying a layer of eons of people

225
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,440
above this array

226
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
become easier to catch bacteria

227
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,940
we catch germs

228
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,140
that blood cell ignores it

229
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,140
Then catch the bacteria from the blood

230
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,140
come to listen

231
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,640
sound from bacteria

232
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,140
if everyone knew

233
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,440
like you listen to an instrument

234
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,640
If you can hear the quality of that instrument

235
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
you can probably guess

236
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Four or Five Cello or Violin

237
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640
the same you can probably guess

238
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,640
what bacteria

239
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
what about these voices

240
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
yes there is some help

241
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,140
so this is what i've said

242
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,140
so let's start asking questions now

243
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,640
Can

244
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,640
OK

245
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
then i think

246
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,640
it's more purposeful than

247
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,640
Let's talk about Laimi first, okay?

248
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,640
Let's explain Raimi

249
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
we are all used to

250
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
everyone is used to

251
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,640
what everyone saw

252
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
probably all

253
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,240
It's a tendency, that is, a meter creature

254
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,640
This little friend is a daughter, she looked like this when she was a child

255
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,440
his sister is chasing him

256
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,680
His height is one meter

257
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,600
I call everyone Yimi

258
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,080
We are one-meter creatures, our world is one-meter creatures

259
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,600
Then inserting three orders of magnitude at once is an ant

260
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,880
about a micron of a mimi

261
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Insert another number, your one million times is the protagonist

262
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,280
Feelings from Dachang

263
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,320
When inserting another order of magnitude

264
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,840
Another three orders of magnitude, when you go down a thousand times

265
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,720
From this point to this side is Ichina you

266
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,640
There are only four atoms in total

267
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,480
This is in my lab, 1998

268
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,880
is a photo of a strange atomic cluster seen for the first time

269
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,080
This resolution photo means

270
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,320
This work is my first doctoral student

271
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,080
he does the best

272
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,280
quickly gained a lot of recognition in the world

273
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,640
We are still doing a lot of research on that aspect

274
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,920
In fact, there is no holiday in our field

275
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,320
But that's where both of us are interested

276
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,080
wait a minute i'm going to talk about the tools we grind

277
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,880
We are actually interested in making atoms or molecules

278
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,680
But because I want to compete with the biotech people for a bite to eat

279
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,440
I had to study bacteria

280
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,560
It's actually a pretty sad story

281
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,680
Then let me explain the meaning of scale first.

282
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,320
Because every time I tell you this 1000 times

283
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Most of that you don't actually feel

284
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,520
And 1000 times you don't actually feel it

285
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,320
But today I want to talk very practical

286
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,000
As long as you know what is 1000 times

287
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,680
Let's talk about 100 times first

288
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,320
Where was my little girl last night?

289
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
She has become the tallest girl in the family

290
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,600
She is 160 cm tall

291
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,680
Then she yelled in the room

292
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,960
see her as a cockroach

293
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,880
You must help me kill this cockroach

294
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,320
Then my heart skipped a beat, why should I help you kill the cockroaches?

295
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,360
Do you know the relationship between your height and the ratio of cockroaches

296
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
if you were a cockroach

297
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
If you are a cockroach

298
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
what about this person

299
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Humans are 1-0 tall

300
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Then you'll see that one day you're yelling over there

301
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Just look at 101 and move him, and then 101 keeps yelling

302
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Hurry up and hit him, hit him?

303
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Just a bunch of 101s running around on the street

304
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Let's say there are cockroaches, there are cockroaches, there are people

305
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
of course not

306
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
but that's weird

307
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
people are so strange

308
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
you only see cockroaches

309
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
My wife stopped fighting when she saw the ants

310
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That's 1000 times

311
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
1000 times means that

312
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You go to Seven Star Mountain

313
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Your Qixing Mountain suddenly retreated 30 kilometers away

314
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
After taking the potion, I still screamed at you

315
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Of course this is

316
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It means that people actually have all the power behind you.

317
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
that size feeling

318
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Let me tell you what you feel about numbers

319
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
really want to think about you

320
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Twice already big giant

321
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Like when you're twice your height walking in

322
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
is very scary

323
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
not to mention

324
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
so you are seen what kushra those geography

325
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,940
Those Kushras have no sense

326
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,700
But one word is a thousand times

327
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,240
The most exaggerated would be to say

328
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,440
object

329
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,300
is the earth

330
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,240
we are creatures on earth

331
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,940
We are a million times smaller than Earth

332
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,840
That is to say, if you are lucky

333
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,380
you just find a good zoom spot

334
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,780
As soon as you look, you happen to see a certain snail beach

335
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,380
It's nice to see some creatures that look like these things

336
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,480
just lay there like this

337
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,580
you put this at a certain point

338
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,480
One point of flashlight disaster

339
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,280
Then when magnified a million times

340
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,280
you see these things

341
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,480
actually looks about the same

342
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,280
no difference

343
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,980
That's a million times faster

344
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,280
In other words, our relationship with the earth

345
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,280
The relationship between bacteria and us

346
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,780
In fact, this size is just your name

347
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
same thing

348
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
so now

349
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,500
There is a noun called human ball

350
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,200
an earth, yes

351
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,600
so you are human ball

352
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,800
You and I are human balls

353
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,200
finally that translation is very interesting

354
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,300
if flipping the ball

355
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,500
people will laugh

356
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,900
But as long as there is a way to scrape it up

357
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,700
Then of course we have a lot of drama

358
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,200
so let's see

359
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,600
drama is actually a

360
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,400
There are many creatures older than us

361
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,900
Because this drama has a protagonist

362
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,500
In this case, I think people in the body should not dare to say such things to me.

363
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,300
Because the earth was formed forty-five years ago

364
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,700
about thirty or forty years ago

365
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,400
It turns out that the drama has already happened

366
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,300
There must have been ancient dramas in those days

367
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,000
There's a drama up here in the whole life

368
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What we now see more often

369
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,500
Everyone has Gram and Young's bacteria

370
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,800
Variety of Grammy plays

371
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,600
Then with this time it has been

372
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,900
Then we are actually descendants of animals and plants

373
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,100
Then our animals and plants lived about five to one billion years ago

374
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,500
that's not very attractive

375
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,300
Humans are very skimpy

376
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,700
you only have four to eight million people

377
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,400
It is the prime quotient of the whole life

378
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,900
Many of us are juniors like this

379
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,000
so amazing

380
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,500
This junior is super arrogant

381
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,200
I feel like everything is centered on me

382
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
then you will look carefully

383
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,900
I just told you about the human rights

384
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,500
doing things

385
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,700
will we die

386
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,200
is that we will not treat our bacteria

387
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,400
kill us as soon as we hear germs

388
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,000
everyone is angry

389
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,500
I mean, bacteria are so dirty.

390
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,100
You see he just went to wash his hands

391
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,700
The result is a sterilizer.

392
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,500
why is it like this everywhere

393
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
but you will see

394
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
this guy these guys

395
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,500
motion against earth

396
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
In fact, with bacteria trying to kill this guy

397
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,000
This thing seems to be similar

398
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,500
We're digging everywhere

399
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,400
do it here

400
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,300
It's you who made the atmosphere dirty

401
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,000
and then why

402
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,500
Actually quite similar

403
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,800
there's a lot worth it

404
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,200
Let's all go and think about it

405
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
why are we doing this

406
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,500
Well that bacteria

407
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,200
kill that tree owner

408
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
but we didn't get it right it was us

409
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
maybe it's possible to kill the earth

410
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
it's also possible

411
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So we should think about it

412
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
how should i do this

413
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I highly recommend here

414
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
this book is

415
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Let me tell you about the one written by Lida Vice Church

416
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
very popular book

417
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
everyone go back

418
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
don't read my profile

419
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Just go back and buy a copy of The World of Bacteria

420
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
there are very very interesting

421
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
just don't say he has a lot of numbers

422
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Then he asked what he wrote in the preface

423
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
because of his order to write such a book

424
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It is the justice of hoping to return the bacteria

425
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
so don't hear it again

426
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I hope you after that speech

427
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Stop having so many prejudices about bacteria

428
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
don't have that inappropriate

429
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
racial contrarian

430
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I think you are much more advanced than him

431
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Then the number of bacteria on our body

432
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You can estimate it probably

433
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
100 megabytes that many in this episode

434
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
In fact his numbers

435
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
10 times more bacteria than our body

436
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,720
That is to say, if we decide to make an agreement with Confidence, we will play the game of democracy.

437
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
we vote we only lose

438
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,520
because he's already 10 times bigger

439
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,560
we are a minority

440
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,840
we should immediately

441
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,840
Our cells vote and lose

442
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,040
it's an interesting number

443
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,440
There are about 1,000 kinds of beliefs in the human digestive system.

444
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,240
I was there

445
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,840
Most of those numbers are mostly unknown to us.

446
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,440
none of us can cultivate

447
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,320
we don't know each other

448
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,000
They're like saying a lot of life on Earth is in the wild

449
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
they all had a great time

450
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,520
But he's fine if he doesn't go to Utah

451
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,680
You don't have to put him in the zoo to raise it, it will be very difficult

452
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,040
There are not many animals that we can raise

453
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,040
the same bacteria on our body

454
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,480
This is what many of my bio colleagues have said

455
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,720
would agree with me

456
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,280
the vast majority of these thousand species of bacteria

457
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,080
In fact, we have no way to train him in the experiment

458
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,440
so we don't know him

459
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
That means

460
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,360
It is more interesting to put mountain towels in the wild

461
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,020
Raising a lot of broilers for you is actually what we will raise

462
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,400
But it's actually less interesting

463
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,620
Also he mentioned some very interesting things

464
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,900
And then bacteria actually have a love-hate relationship

465
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,680
They will also have liangjingxiang

466
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,060
Because there is an act similar to marriage

467
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,220
Then they also have collective wear

468
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,380
Then there are also sacrifices to clamp me these actions

469
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,420
In fact, after reading this book, I thought

470
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:26,720
Professor Xu is really very, very

471
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,740
very very storytelling

472
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,100
write a quick

473
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,460
I read in his preface that he seems to have finished the book in two months

474
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,060
I really admire him very much

475
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,860
So it is highly recommended here

476
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,300
you can leave now

477
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,300
Just read a book

478
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,220
why listen to me

479
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,540
good

480
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,380
In addition, what I would recommend is to say

481
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,260
You can read last July's issue of Science Journal

482
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,980
Then there are two articles

483
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,700
Then these two articles

484
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,660
I would recommend here is to say

485
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,180
one of these

486
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,020
That is to say, this is shared with the continuation

487
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,600
Your kind of numbers are worth tasting

488
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,000
is why we know that there are about a thousand species of bacteria

489
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,600
In fact, it is because we are talking about how many genes there are in bacteria

490
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Not the number of genes that make our bodies like ours

491
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,600
About 20,000 to 25,000

492
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,100
But our bacteria have 150 times more genes than us

493
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,700
That's the bacteria if we count it all as one organism

494
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
Let it adjust the whole kind

495
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,900
In total they give us a

496
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,300
That is, if the number of genes is reversed

497
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,700
We lost even more, right?

498
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,300
We just said ten and we lost

499
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,100
And to use the numbers of genes

500
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,100
Then we lost very miserably.

501
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,100
There's a very biological

502
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,900
related to medicine

503
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,500
In this article, there are also 1.0 in the Science generation.

504
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:57,700
Professor Tetger Kasmarion is mentioned here at the very beginning of his article

505
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,900
He said that our ability in genes

506
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,400
It is the point of view that the system function is better

507
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,600
interested in living on us

508
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,000
Let our immune system function better

509
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,200
Such a statement is the only view on traditional

510
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,000
Because when we hear bacteria we think

511
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,800
Bacteria are bad things

512
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,000
It is best not to have bacteria in our seven bodies

513
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,600
But now gradually the information

514
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,400
Gradually more and more clear trend

515
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,800
is immunity

516
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,000
Missed a few words from this today

517
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,200
is the driver of immune system function

518
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,400
is a symbiotic relationship

519
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,800
i think you grow up

520
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,500
without those bacteria

521
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,800
Actually there are many things

522
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,100
your life won't be very pleasant

523
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,400
If there were no bacteria on earth

524
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
there are too many things

525
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,500
Including whether you drink alcohol

526
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,200
or any of these things

527
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,000
There are no bacteria, everyone can't do it

528
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
too much fermentation

529
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,800
These things are done by bacteria

530
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,800
In fact, bacteria are one of the best

531
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Laimi made by myself

532
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,000
Raimi's robot

533
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Then he will repeat himself

534
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,400
and then do something for you

535
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,600
So take these loose

536
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,600
The Laimi machine that lives with you

537
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
is bacteria

538
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
this is bacteria

539
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,900
Then if those who are dependent on our civilization

540
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,800
you look carefully

541
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,400
There are various types of bacteria in our gut

542
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,700
then on our skin

543
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,700
every place

544
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,500
In fact, when we come out of the mother's birth canal

545
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,800
from that moment

546
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,200
We start with a bunch of bacterial denominators

547
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,300
Then he'll be on you when he's certified

548
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,600
repeated to many children

549
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,500
Maybe now there might be some evidence telling you that

550
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,500
If you're not well inside your bowels

551
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,000
There is a time when a bacterial phase is wrong

552
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,500
or whatever you are getting older

553
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,400
your bacteria

554
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,500
Then there is a vision in the body

555
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,700
Then there is a bacterial phase in the gut

556
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,500
Because the bacterial phase is when the beginning is wrong

557
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,400
your life will be out of balance

558
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,100
Then this moving relationship will be messed up

559
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,560
You won't be happier when you break

560
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,720
So the best way is to

561
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,720
You have to find a way to talk to your fellow bacteria

562
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,840
Get along well and live in peace with everyone, and have a better life

563
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,080
I think I should agree with Xu Minda's textbook after I explained it like this

564
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,440
He wants us to pay back a bacterium

565
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,120
Another article talks about so-called probiotics

566
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,560
I was supposed to bring a bottle or two with me today

567
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,720
Let me tell you that when I drink one or two bottles in one gulp

568
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,760
I will take the population of the whole earth by a dozen

569
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,480
It was the confidence of dozens of people who drank it all in one gulp

570
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,120
Is that so?

571
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,400
Listen and see if there is a bottle or two

572
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,440
Then his size is as big as the earth came over

573
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,640
Then drink all the people on our earth in one gulp

574
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,160
It's actually quite scary for bacteria.

575
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,480
right don't you think

576
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,360
Only sixty-one people disappeared.

577
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,120
ok then we're going to start talking

578
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,760
what is the sound of bacteria

579
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,240
I'm really not satisfied with this word

580
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,600
What is the difference between the sounds played by Ma Youyou and bacteria?

581
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
we know

582
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,800
What is Ma You playing?

583
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,500
Everyone knows that Ma Youyou plays with a big body

584
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
This photo is really Ma Youyou

585
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,500
Yes, but could it really be Ma Youyou?

586
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,300
OK

587
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,300
This is an ad for Ma Youyou's concert

588
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,300
That

589
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,300
The biggest difference between Ma Youyou and bacteria

590
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,300
It's about talking about the plan

591
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,300
just a million times worse

592
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,000
Let's talk about sound

593
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,300
so i'm going to tell you

594
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,000
its difference is

595
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Where is the most important place

596
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,500
Then it's a tone

597
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
shake this thing over there

598
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,000
Then this shock and Ma Youyou's love sound pull the shock

599
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It's actually very similar

600
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,000
It's just that we can't hear the vibration

601
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But the voice of Ma Youyou

602
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
listen 'cause i can't hear

603
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Now of course I can ask one

604
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
One is Ma Youyou's bacteria

605
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Natara's big body

606
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
should

607
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
where to put it frequently

608
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Just for the kids over there

609
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
kid over there

610
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,740
I will ask today's exam questions

611
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,600
They didn't pass the flying mention

612
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,000
don't go home like this

613
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,940
This bacterium Ma Yoyo reminds everyone

614
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,640
May I ask the big theme song played by this bacteria

615
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,340
where is its comment dafabe

616
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,440
I'm about to start talking a little bit

617
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,500
Because I actually study

618
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,340
Also very interested in music

619
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,640
so let me explain

620
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,500
Everyone in Taiwan is playing the piano at home

621
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,340
what's up with this math

622
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,340
What is written on the piano is

623
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,340
That precious man you call it LAL

624
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,340
This standard IWC standard tone

625
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,180
maybe 440

626
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,180
Everyone has heard of A440

627
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,180
A440 means

628
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,680
Your ears are covered with air like this

629
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,180
When pressing 444 times per second

630
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,340
you hear the sound

631
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,380
If there is absolute pitch

632
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,340
You'll say that's LAL

633
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,680
This is what LAL on the piano means

634
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,680
there was a very important musical discovery

635
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,680
I think it's a very important discovery

636
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,120
The meaning of my pronunciation of this matter is

637
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,420
The previous one, the high-pitched one, the rate is lower than that

638
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,400
double, 800%

639
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,120
Then how to divide it, find out that there is an interesting way to divide it

640
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,000
The result of this division is to divide it into 12 semitones

641
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,480
Then the result is that the zero of 12 is 0, and then it is

642
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,120
Here is 1, 1 multiplied by the fold, and then this 1 is corrected

643
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,140
Then we see it here, Masto

644
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,800
like this, go around

645
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,640
That's just right, if it's four semitones

646
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,840
Well, I can't think that these two sounds are vibrato, which seems to be quite harmonious

647
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,320
So it will be more harmonious, then why is it more harmonious

648
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,520
It's because Douyin is so clean

649
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,320
This number, very accurate calculation, the result is just about 5 to 4

650
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,720
Then you sound a lot, that is, there is a voice that is

651
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,520
When I pressed five times, I pressed another four times, and it went smoothly.

652
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:10,380
What's more smooth is that the roots are collected, one is pressed twice, and the other is pressed three times

653
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,680
three to two

654
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:17,100
The smoothest and smoothest are four hundred and four and eight hundred and eight, exactly two pairs

655
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,400
I hit it once, and you hit it twice. In this way, everyone feels that the chorus sound is very, very

656
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,500
Therefore, a series of phenomena

657
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,500
In fact, what they are talking about is a frequency, and what they are talking about is resonance.

658
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,900
or frequency these relationships

659
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:38,500
So, today I hope to use such a method to tell you

660
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,200
I’m in the manager, and I’m trying to tell everyone what’s going on with Xi Jinping’s voice

661
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
We're going back to ask him

662
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,100
That Ma Yoyo's

663
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,100
please

664
00:28:53,100 --> 00:29:00,100
Why our ears are used to hearing, we all know that the frequency of our ears may be about

665
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,840
560 to 560 thousand or if someone doesn't want to listen, don't listen

666
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,840
What's the best frequency?

667
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,840
There is actually a very simple reason for this

668
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,840
It's about our body

669
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:18,840
Because the number of depths per second in the air is 330 meters per second

670
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,840
Everyone has heard of this junior high school

671
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,440
if there is a thing

672
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,440
Its height and length have a resonance gun when the height reaches 1 meter

673
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,640
Its frequency is 330

674
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
It approaches 440 people every 30 meters

675
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
almost there

676
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,340
So many people like the general policeman

677
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,340
he is very comfortable

678
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,840
It's not just ears

679
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,840
his whole body is comfortable

680
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Because he resonates with this resonant gun

681
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,840
i'm done talking

682
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,840
Because Toddler Ma and Tomorrow I are both 1 meter tall

683
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,840
The depth is about 330

684
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,340
So our ears are a natural evolutionary process

685
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,540
Just 430

686
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,960
Because this is about one or two hundred hertz on average

687
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,680
The average amount needs to be in the range of Hertz to several thousand

688
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,160
For example, when singing very high-pitched

689
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,560
He is going to put the resonance river on the small top of the head

690
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,760
The younger he is, the higher the average is, the level of resonance in Zhenjiang

691
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,600
So what should the average be in the Xijing area?

692
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,000
Did you raise your hand when you were a child?

693
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,680
do you know the answer

694
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,160
That's a million times more

695
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,600
Because Xijing's body size is a million times different from ours

696
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,760
So he's a million times taller on average

697
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,320
So if Xijing plays his cello

698
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,080
Of course we can't hear

699
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,480
If this molecule is playing

700
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,960
When this molecule plays his cello

701
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,160
that would be another point

702
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,480
Because of the size of the molecule

703
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,160
It is ten to ten times worse than ours.

704
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,080
So the average is higher again

705
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,880
That's why

706
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,000
So of course we can't hear

707
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,560
The voice of Wenzi and Molecule

708
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,500
We know that the principle is actually quite similar

709
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,500
We just figured out a way to secretly convert it

710
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
see if we can hear

711
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:14,500
This is how I think about bacteria from a human with atoms and molecules

712
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,000
Bacteria, I can tell you very clearly this time

713
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,500
What I call the sound of bacteria

714
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,500
It's actually a molecule from bacteria

715
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,500
how often they vibrate

716
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
if i could hear

717
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,500
I know what molecules the bacteria emit

718
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,500
what kind of taste are those molecules

719
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:38,500
Or the concept of taste or sound is like this

720
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
ok

721
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,500
I speak a little fast

722
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,500
So if you want to know more details

723
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,500
It's okay to interrupt me

724
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,000
Okay, so we're going to see how to listen to this now.

725
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
This is the comparison I'm going to talk about today

726
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Scientifically speaking, slowing down the valley of light sounds scary

727
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,000
This is an Indian scientist who won the Nobel Prize in 1930, the Physics Prize

728
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
He is all Asian, the first Asian to win the Nobel Prize in Science

729
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
so i was probably very young and i only got the nodel prize

730
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
He did some very simple experiments himself in India, it sounds simple

731
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Then published a magazine article in 1928 now called the shock number no one knows how much

732
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:38,000
No one listened to it, no one didn’t know much about it, and there was an article about two or three years later that he won the Nobel Prize

733
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,000
He proved that resources are very simple, that is, he took some scales, and there was also a yellow light

734
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
What can be green-yellow is also green-red, and it can be turned green

735
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Then he proved one thing, that is, the light, the reason why the light sees different colors is because the screen is different

736
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Don't say that hearing without red light is better

737
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,220
slower, lower

738
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,860
The frequency of blue light is higher

739
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,400
The frequency of the blue light is just a little brighter.

740
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,940
When I use a light mirror like this

741
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,040
when the light mirror

742
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,840
There are very, very small light mirrors

743
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,240
it's time to come out

744
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,080
it will run out with a yellow light

745
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,740
Then it is clear about this matter

746
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,240
so it writes this article

747
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,880
Then later when it was explained like this

748
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,540
why is this

749
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,880
Because there are some molecules in it

750
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,040
After those molecules are excited by this light wave,

751
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,920
Take that molecule as if dialing that emotion

752
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,420
it vibrates

753
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:40,320
The frequency of the light at the time of the shock

754
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,220
just give it that frequency

755
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,280
Then the light only has its own frequency

756
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,980
just lost a little bit

757
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,320
so it was supposed to be aura

758
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,580
then dropped a little bit

759
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,220
become light and run out

760
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,920
That's right, let's talk about this matter.

761
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,920
So I tell many classmates every time I talk about this time

762
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,920
Everyone is a star

763
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
very angry

764
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
that person got one

765
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,720
Just have a sun light, then the landscape mirror, and then take a few pieces of that rotten glass

766
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,560
That's the proof that if Li Guang goes in and yellow light comes out, he will take the captain

767
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,640
Why spend so much money on central research like this

768
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,840
Then you have to explain this more profoundly, which probably means that it is called a

769
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,600
For every molecule it actually has one like a resonance gun

770
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,320
then it starts to oscillate, it has a frequency it likes

771
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,560
When you send in a light, when you excite this thing

772
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,200
This light will lose a little frequency, which happens to be

773
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,520
It likes this and that frequency, so as long as you see this, you will know

774
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,920
There is a musical instrument inside, and that musical instrument emits this frequency

775
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,320
Then this kind of thing can enable you to be called vibration spectrum

776
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,880
Then we generally say that it just thinks about life.

777
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,720
The frequency of direct life is very, very high, we can't even hear it

778
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,680
What we're relying on is a laser light going in

779
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,200
Then let it come out and see how much it becomes, let's measure how much it becomes

780
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,400
How much will know the instrument that I measured

781
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,260
The instrument that I talked about a lot

782
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,700
its resonant frequency

783
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,800
What is the vibration frequency it likes

784
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,700
This is the whole story

785
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,400
What about Mr. Raban?

786
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,600
Just invented this Laban public servant, and there are also very fast

787
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,660
So I get it in two or three years when I have a few

788
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,100
what you dreamed of and got it at such a young age

789
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,300
If you want to look carefully

790
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,600
Clearer young people are like

791
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,600
Let's say now this is a molecule

792
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,300
This molecule probably

793
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,300
Only the vice president can read it

794
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,300
Because I am your declaration

795
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,900
I don't even know what this molecule is called

796
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,000
I just know it's some carbon, cream, green

797
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,500
Then this one looks like a flasher

798
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,700
there is a vibration pattern

799
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,200
it opens like a flash

800
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,800
Then there's one that likes to vibrate

801
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,700
So for each molecule it has

802
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,900
it vibrates in different places

803
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,800
For example, this carbon heel

804
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,000
Large, with carbon and oxygen

805
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,200
it has one like this

806
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,100
It seems to be stretched like this

807
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,700
each of these has a pattern

808
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,800
Then they all have their own vibration frequency

809
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,200
so which molecule is over there

810
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,540
Who wants to take his time

811
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,440
You will measure several frequencies

812
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,200
Yes, then you can analyze his different frequencies and you will know.

813
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,360
use him as a fingerprint

814
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,160
you know what molecule

815
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,720
like say you listen if your ears are really good

816
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,060
you listen to a good piano

817
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,720
He or you listen to different instruments

818
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,560
You can tell what kind of instrument that is when you hear it

819
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,120
It's the same reason

820
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,000
So we borrow the concept

821
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,060
Treat that tone like a music garden

822
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,240
then we maybe

823
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,000
If you can hear the sound from bacteria

824
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,560
we can go back and say

825
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,160
this may be some bacteria

826
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,200
Or the more interesting thing I want to talk about is to say

827
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,000
Then if this bacterium is attacked by others,

828
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,640
For example, like being us

829
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,240
we call it the idiot antibiotic

830
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,560
From a bacterial point of view

831
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,560
They were poisoned by us, right?

832
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,760
our miserable

833
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,600
When everyone starts to kill

834
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,040
defense of bacteria

835
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,960
then he may emit molecules

836
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,960
or his skin is peeled off by you

837
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,400
or what these molecules

838
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,960
can we measure them

839
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,380
at a vibrational frequency

840
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,940
then we will know

841
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,340
change the voice of bacteria

842
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,760
That's the story I'm going to tell today

843
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,260
OK

844
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,260
how to do this

845
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:12,160
This frequency change is clearly coordinated in this place

846
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
that's not the case

847
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,300
If I notice here that there are some real experts

848
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,460
they are fast asleep

849
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,960
heard here already said

850
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
So my elementary school here already knows

851
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,100
i'm still here this

852
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,700
It's okay if you start typing

853
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,700
don't mind too much

854
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,700
Because I'm not talking about you

855
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
good

856
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Ramek's light stock is actually very good

857
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
What is the most useful Lame light stock?

858
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
in the quiz

859
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
test

860
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
that

861
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
would you be sir or

862
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
when your boyfriend proposes to you

863
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
is it true

864
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
he took that diamond

865
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Then drill it for you like this

866
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I bought an 80 carat diamond to propose to you

867
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Then you see how it is possible

868
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
How is it possible for your salary

869
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
how to check

870
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
diamond

871
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
No

872
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,400
From a chemical point of view, even if it is the same as coal, it is charcoal

873
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,720
If you go to propose to him and take a piece of charcoal, do you take one?

874
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:14,340
My love is so real, then throw it in the fire and burn it

875
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,000
Then you took him a very shiny one, it may be a Soviet

876
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,800
what do you do then what do you do

877
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,760
This chemistry is...

878
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,560
what is this? i don't know, it won't make a strange sound

879
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,340
So this...

880
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,400
How to test it, diamonds and Shi Nuo are the same

881
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,600
It's all charcoal, or just plain...

882
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,560
There is a very simple way to talk about coal or something

883
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,560
It is the two big drawing boards, although their materials are all charcoal

884
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,120
But the arrangement of their atoms is different

885
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,960
Then the arrangement is different, resulting in this action

886
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,960
The same material, when making a different feeling, its frequency is different

887
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
so your boyfriend gave you a diamond

888
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
you bring it is the first thing you take it

889
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Then you break the switch

890
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
once frequently wrong

891
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
OK

892
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
That's it for next time

893
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Actually we have some legislators

894
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
When visiting our office

895
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Let's just tell him we'll do this

896
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
That's a female legislator

897
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
What we care most about is not whether our experiments are done well or not.

898
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Is his diamond really like this?

899
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I want to say you can tell the name

900
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
in this way

901
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Then of course you see

902
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That's because it's very easy to use recently.

903
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Pull off the master's pull off

904
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Except for that

905
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
advanced is not really love me outside

906
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
and many other uses

907
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
various materials

908
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
you can hear his voice clearly

909
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Then you can tell

910
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
take him as a fingerprint

911
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
You can use it for many tests

912
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
but pull off the master

913
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
just after coming out

914
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
have similar grades

915
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
In the 1970s and 1980s

916
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
actually very painful

917
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Why

918
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
There is an important reason to say

919
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Pull off the signal of the master

920
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
very very small

921
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Everyone probably knows Fluorescent

922
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Everyone in the fluorescent family has

923
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It looks like Li Yujun's

924
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,340
In fact, there is a fluorescent light in the middle

925
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,600
Fluorescent itself is easy to light up

926
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,800
that light

927
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,160
I just told you about the Valley of Rahman Optics

928
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,760
It's up to me to type a document to get in.

929
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,600
Then it came out very hot

930
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,600
very slightly hot

931
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,240
colored light

932
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,600
this thing to detect

933
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,200
often before

934
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,600
I told the teacher who is Raman Optics Valley

935
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,040
ok then you can go

936
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,340
Go to the Yangliang thing

937
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,600
and put it in

938
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,160
Then the students will go skating on the mountain

939
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,300
The student will come back in three days

940
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,900
The Optics Valley just came out a little bit

941
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,200
Because that signal is very, very slightly hot

942
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,500
16 orders of magnitude worse than cloud light

943
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,800
I just said that the earth is 6 orders of magnitude different from us

944
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,000
This Raman Optical Valley is 16 orders of magnitude different from Yunguang

945
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,200
That difference of 10 orders of magnitude becomes

946
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,900
It's so quiet I can't hear you at all

947
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,700
sounds like

948
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,000
I can hear you

949
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,620
Then it won't be talked about since people got it

950
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,400
because it's useless

951
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,100
Because it is difficult to do this experiment

952
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,200
in 1974

953
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,000
there is a very

954
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
change of interest

955
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
at the University of West Germany

956
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
especially professors they are doing

957
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
accidental discovery

958
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
you are going to detect

959
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Here they do a

960
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
molecular

961
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
They're going to measure the molecule's short ad

962
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Turns out they put it in a

963
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
surface of a plume

964
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
The results of it

965
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
What about the surface of the feather mud?

966
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
happens to be rough

967
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
The results of it

968
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Suddenly exploded by 1 million times

969
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Exploded 1 million times

970
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
1 million times is to suddenly put feather mud

971
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
down to the size of the earth

972
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
super scary

973
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
because it is on a surface

974
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
So this phenomenon is called

975
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
surface enhancement

976
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
shorten the ad

977
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Because people call it Surface Enhanced

978
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
shorten the ad

979
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Abbreviated as Surge

980
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
wait a minute we'll see a lot of words

981
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
S-E-R-S is such a thing

982
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Everyone who suffers from the phenomenon of Surge

983
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
wow many people

984
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,600
I thought this could find him

985
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,680
why on earth

986
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,180
Why can be enhanced a million times

987
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,700
Some even enhanced to that meaning times

988
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,500
or something

989
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,900
that's it

990
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,540
At the beginning of 1970, the big circle was big

991
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,600
it's been 40 years

992
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,800
I solemnly declare here

993
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,000
The most detailed reason

994
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Why can it be enhanced to so much

995
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,200
From theory to experiment

996
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,200
issues that have not yet been fully resolved

997
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,200
This question is a

998
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,400
still a still ongoing party center

999
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,000
Even if everything is as good as we are now

1000
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,300
But that detail in that

1001
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,800
so many male protagonists

1002
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,100
I can't even talk here today

1003
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,100
but i want to tell you

1004
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,000
The person who discovered this phenomenon

1005
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,500
Some people think they've been dreaming about him

1006
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,300
that should be in his lifetime

1007
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,200
will get that to talk like this

1008
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
I think he probably doesn't have much hope

1009
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,500
that I know like this

1010
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,100
that would be a very interesting phenomenon

1011
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,500
But I don't agree that a thing can be enhanced to a million to a billion times

1012
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,000
something like this is a big deal

1013
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Just like when the money in your pocket suddenly increases by a billion times

1014
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,500
you are very very excited like this

1015
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,000
That's certainly an interesting phenomenon

1016
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,500
But it starts directly from the details

1017
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,000
It is the electromagnetic factory

1018
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,500
Because laser light is an electromagnetic factory

1019
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,000
Then why is it like this

1020
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,500
And then what exactly is the molecule that is adsorbed on the surface of this silver

1021
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,500
so what's under this arrangement

1022
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,000
it will have such a large signal enhancement

1023
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
This is how the details of each film require lucky scientific research

1024
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,500
Then we have been doing it until now

1025
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,500
but i want to tell you again

1026
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,500
Although we don't fully understand its rationale

1027
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
But we can still use

1028
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,500
It's like saying I don't understand what violin sentiment is all about

1029
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,500
But it has to be about the fact that I can't play the violin

1030
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,500
is the same reason

1031
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,500
so it's for you

1032
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,500
but really

1033
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,560
So from the most primitive principle, we still don't have a special understanding

1034
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,240
Although we have about 80% or 90% understanding, it is already good

1035
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:15,040
But those last few areas hopefully we can go on in my lifetime

1036
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,240
This two-sided, this Laren light map, this phenomenon

1037
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,240
In 1974, it was red for about ten years before it became a plated

1038
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,640
Just because they can't go on

1039
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,080
that's great

1040
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,720
It's that they have probably changed their careers in those years.

1041
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,200
By 1997

1042
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,000
There is a scholar named Nie Shuning who went to the United States from mainland China

1043
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,240
Nie Shuning

1044
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,440
This article he published in Science

1045
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,560
This article has probably been cited 3,000 times so far

1046
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:49,240
Because this is tantamount to the renaissance movement of surface-enhanced full-light maps

1047
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,960
Thirty years later, I suddenly published this article again

1048
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,000
He did a very interesting experiment

1049
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,920
When I was just drawing with him

1050
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,240
We've got the rough surface when we're here today

1051
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,380
What happened after Ke Zhi appeared?

1052
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,600
Don't use this to corrode

1053
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,500
he's in trouble

1054
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,380
I don't know if I said it

1055
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,100
Let's just make some rice

1056
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,000
particles of silver

1057
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,060
just hit one by one

1058
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,900
and sprinkle it on the surface

1059
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,300
then measure this

1060
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,340
Enhance the signal of Optics Valley?

1061
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,900
Then he did it

1062
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,100
Then he took that Optics Valley

1063
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,260
That's the one

1064
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,340
It's just gold particles sprinkled on it.

1065
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,440
and then what

1066
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,060
He hit a light on it

1067
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,260
Particle shot in

1068
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,400
Then I saw you talking about particle light shooting in

1069
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,240
The words of Raman Kwang

1070
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,480
yellow light running out

1071
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,480
That's either Raman light or it's reflected back

1072
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,780
It's the particles of light that go in and the particles of light come out, right?

1073
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,980
Well, you can see this small picture

1074
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,580
Because most of it is grain light going in and grain light coming out

1075
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,240
there are a lot of

1076
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,240
Granules of Lamikin

1077
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,140
In the end, I saw two or three

1078
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,980
yellowish

1079
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,740
Then this article becomes a

1080
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,700
very very interesting discovery

1081
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,240
So everyone thought

1082
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,840
That is, we tore 10,000 pieces

1083
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,880
that that that

1084
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,120
This light source goes down and cries

1085
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Once we can, everyone will work hard to prop up the signal into a million times, and each person will share a hundred times

1086
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It turns out that there are only three people who are actually working. What is the consciousness? Those three people are police officers.

1087
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:22,000
This phenomenon is called the discovery that even if the surface is enhanced and recovered

1088
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
In the past 30 years, I didn’t know anything about it. There were some very, very HOT people in it.

1089
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It is called HOTSBOT, which is a very hot hot zone, and it still contributes 5-60% of the real contribution

1090
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
The other tens of thousands of people only contribute the other 5-60%

1091
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
So this is called the concept of a very hot hot zone, which is the hot spot of HOTSBOT

1092
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
That’s why I’m gradually starting to talk about what my research has to do with this matter.

1093
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I will comment here first, and talk about the original problem

1094
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I see that there are not many people who go to bed early

1095
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,840
So I'm actually more and more confident

1096
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,840
Teacher you just said that

1097
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,500
440 that voice that pulls

1098
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,540
Is his higher octave 888

1099
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,840
What about an octave lower?

1100
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,880
an octave lower is that frequency

1101
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,780
This except 2

1102
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,640
220

1103
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,140
220

1104
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,880
So he's a 2 speed

1105
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,680
Then his contribution is to say

1106
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,840
why did you find this

1107
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,780
if you can't cut it

1108
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,880
if you can't cut it

1109
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,980
i can't turn around

1110
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:27,480
do you know

1111
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,280
that's what i say

1112
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,680
the thought of cutting it into 12 semitones

1113
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,580
Then there is a semitone between the eight and the close

1114
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,880
Then there is a semitone between C and D

1115
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,480
Total like this plus

1116
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,260
The result

1117
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,220
just so close

1118
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,680
There will be an extra charge

1119
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,580
There's also the matter of multi-tracking

1120
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,520
Then his ears heard

1121
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,320
Well, I've actually met people with that kind of absolute pitch.

1122
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,060
they hate it

1123
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,260
because what he wants is

1124
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,560
I just said 3 to 2

1125
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,960
he wants to be like a mathematician

1126
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,600
Accurate 3 to 2, it can hear the difference

1127
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,980
Just now I told you that it was 1.4987

1128
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,620
If the ratio is 3 to 2, it is not 1.5.

1129
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:15,020
That's 1.4987, isn't it one thousandth of a difference?

1130
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,600
It's almost audible at all frequencies.

1131
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,760
So if you listen, well I hear Acapella

1132
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,860
Last night I went to the National Concert Hall was Akapela

1133
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,160
Many masters there are real

1134
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,760
when we get along very, very, very well

1135
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,880
Not the sounds on the piano

1136
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,780
because I'm always 440

1137
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,420
I am not the frequency of 4401

1138
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,420
I am 4401.5, so any frequency is fine

1139
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,820
So these are selected

1140
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:43,460
Once selected, the other sounds seem to be non-existent to you

1141
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,920
But the sound of 4401 means of course

1142
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,420
Wait a minute, I'm finally going to broadcast the sound of that bacteria to you

1143
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,220
I say that because you are digitally generated

1144
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,120
So you want me to put a pattern

1145
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:57,320
I'll wait until I play a 723 frequency for you to listen to

1146
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
OK

1147
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
there are other problems

1148
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
If not

1149
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
It seems that everyone is still maintaining the status quo

1150
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I'll just keep talking

1151
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
we just want to say

1152
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
after some research

1153
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
found that those hot spots

1154
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
what is it actually

1155
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
looks like

1156
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
you thought

1157
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
here is a bright spot

1158
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It is because the optical display resolution is not enough

1159
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
really those hot spots

1160
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
It's actually two atoms of gold.

1161
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
it's very very close

1162
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
that in optical display

1163
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
These particles of gold that I'm going to talk about

1164
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Size is 25 Nie Camp

1165
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I just forgot to mention one thing

1166
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
What are we usually used to

1167
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
For example filter

1168
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
wavelength

1169
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
is the fluctuation of the wave

1170
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Like the waves of the ocean the long way this wave goes

1171
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
The filter is about 550 or so

1172
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It is 550 Naiying

1173
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So we're doing camping now

1174
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
It's better than that wave

1175
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
10 times less frequent

1176
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
or 20 times as small

1177
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
so we make that light

1178
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Just a little big beach to see

1179
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
The fluctuation of the wave of the ocean is one meter.

1180
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
When we reach the shore, if it is a sandy beach with accidental rocks

1181
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
The person who accidentally stoned one by one fell

1182
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
The waves hit the small stones by the sea

1183
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Those little stones are using this metaphor

1184
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
These are the small stones that we are making at Nini Technology

1185
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
That wave hits like a light wave

1186
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
550 Nini is hit on a particle of tens of Nini

1187
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
is such a game

1188
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Because our Naini technology has now advanced to

1189
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
It’s not ideal yet, but it’s already possible to be Shi Nai Ni

1190
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Well done here

1191
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Then we just have to find a way to agree

1192
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Since it is like this

1193
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Are we going to be able to do a bunch of Nenny examples?

1194
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Then they get very close

1195
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
So everyone is hot in the middle

1196
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
In that case, wouldn't the signal be amplified even more?

1197
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,000
That's when I was a student in the master's class of the Physics Department of National Taiwan University with me.

1198
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
gave advice

1199
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,500
It's a long story because I've actually been doing this for almost a decade

1200
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,300
I'm not here to spend time telling stories

1201
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:14,100
But this young man was very interesting, so he said yes

1202
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:18,100
We actually just happened to have a senior working on this material

1203
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,500
This material is here, many first-time students can do it by themselves when they go home.

1204
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:25,600
This, everyone said that selling Mi Technology sounds very difficult

1205
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,600
How to do Mimi Technology, in fact, it sounds very simple

1206
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,000
When you get home, go buy a battery

1207
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:40,100
Then you make a little acid, then leave the acid or muddy acid

1208
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:45,100
Or a little bit of acetic acid, which is safer

1209
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:49,100
So stainless steel, another piece of aluminum

1210
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:53,700
Aluminum is usually at home, and the aluminum box puts it here

1211
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:58,100
Then add this battery here, then add it, and then it starts to clear

1212
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,100
Then after taking the risk, you thought it would be difficult

1213
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,200
very expensive machine

1214
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,320
This is why everyone should support the central research

1215
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,120
you have expensive machines

1216
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,520
you can take this picture

1217
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,680
just become money

1218
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,720
you didn't see say

1219
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,680
it turns out that

1220
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,320
if there is not

1221
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,840
you see nothing happened to us

1222
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,360
It's just a woman here

1223
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,120
but when you actually look

1224
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,280
It's actually full of holes like this

1225
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,360
And this is completely spontaneous

1226
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,560
when you don't need a car

1227
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,640
it is brought

1228
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,320
and very interesting

1229
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,760
This is a material given in the previous part

1230
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,280
That

1231
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,200
You see it's really just a hole

1232
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,760
keep it in

1233
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,760
it is this

1234
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,360
cut it all the way

1235
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,440
it's really

1236
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,160
The straight film is always put in like this

1237
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,440
keep it in

1238
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,240
That

1239
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,560
its pipe is

1240
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,240
This is like a room tube

1241
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,760
But a whole row of chamber tubes

1242
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,000
it keeps going in

1243
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,520
this is the material

1244
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,440
so

1245
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,760
there should be a way

1246
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,560
OK

1247
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,560
Automatically

1248
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I should not be...

1249
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
they are...

1250
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,500
have...

1251
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,000
yesterday no...

1252
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I'm going to listen to Cappeda

1253
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
There is a special sound maker like this

1254
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
is good music

1255
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
music

1256
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
music

1257
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I said you take this material

1258
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Then start going...

1259
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
This is called...

1260
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Shock oxidation

1261
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
This is called blow oxidation treatment

1262
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Oxidation of the blood vessel in the target

1263
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
This way I will always...

1264
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
go down

1265
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,500
That sound doesn't need to be too audio

1266
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,500
Is this okay

1267
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,500
Can

1268
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,000
so it's because the sound

1269
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,500
there's noise

1270
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,500
there's noise

1271
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,500
now he is talking

1272
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,000
or this

1273
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,500
So in the end, there is a shortage of funds

1274
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,500
when i first came

1275
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,500
some that really good one

1276
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,500
Can't connect to a computer

1277
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,500
so wait a minute

1278
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,500
We relate donations later

1279
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,500
that's the funniest thing to say

1280
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,500
listen up everyone

1281
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,500
He will do this himself

1282
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,000
A pipe goes down vertically

1283
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,500
This expression throughout the cycle

1284
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,000
only you

1285
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
only he is like this

1286
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,500
you smooth it out

1287
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,500
So there are a lot of new bricks here.

1288
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,500
anyway you have to smooth

1289
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,500
And today we will put it

1290
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,500
put it in the plug

1291
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,500
Then he'll grow in by himself like this

1292
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,500
Then keep bricking in

1293
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,500
Then this brick goes in

1294
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,500
brick into this

1295
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,760
So this ratio

1296
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,160
This ratio is easily

1297
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,000
This is like a tunnel with this pipe

1298
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,560
The length of this tunnel is compared with this pipeline

1299
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,760
It is easy to do casually and it is longer than the snow mountain tunnel

1300
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,200
So when you go in, you can say that my current management environment is

1301
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,800
Shimi is ready

1302
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,600
Then you need to get a 500 mic

1303
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,640
just wait for three days

1304
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,240
And then it turns straight in and straight

1305
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,600
just keep turning in

1306
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,560
just put it there

1307
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,200
Then you're skiing again, just go skiing

1308
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,560
do what you should be doing

1309
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,800
you are so sour

1310
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,960
Just straight up help you do this later

1311
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,760
That's a chemistry called itself

1312
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,000
self organized

1313
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,960
a process of self-combination

1314
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,360
that's more interesting like this

1315
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:49,960
If you

1316
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,000
You find an acid that is sulfuric acid

1317
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,360
Then you tell me that I should be Yang Jizu

1318
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,400
What is the voltage of a battery

1319
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,160
How much did I spend a earth voltage on?

1320
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:09,620
It will find, that is to say, you go to different acids, called zero acid, salicylic acid

1321
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:14,180
One thing that will happen when they are in different pressure changes is

1322
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:18,380
Even if it is lined up here, it will be neatly arranged, horizontally

1323
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,900
As long as the rows are close to each other, like this one is well-behaved

1324
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,100
Arranged like a grid, not like the one just now

1325
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,420
The row here is not so good

1326
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,900
But in some acids, it selects its own row

1327
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:35,040
And it's very, very simple, you'll make this Naimi

1328
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,860
That is, you add the transformer voltage of each frame

1329
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:42,860
The distance between the hole and the hole is only 2.5 meters

1330
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:45,740
Which means you're going back home and it's easy to get that

1331
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:49,420
You can buy a nine-panel battery with just one

1332
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,140
Bring it, it's easy about 50 yuan, 100 yuan

1333
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:56,140
Then you take a little bit of acetic acid, or that

1334
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,380
that salicylic acid or something and then you put it in

1335
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,540
I probably wouldn't have acted like this back then

1336
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,020
But not so well

1337
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,900
but the distance between their average openings

1338
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,760
It also fits this relationship

1339
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,420
Then it's easy to get out of that country

1340
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,500
Or elementary school classmates did this

1341
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,320
Then take it to talk to their teacher

1342
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,540
I made a nanostructure

1343
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,860
The nanostructures are only 25 nanometers apart

1344
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:22,160
If you don't believe me, just go and see for yourself

1345
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,120
Then the teacher said

1346
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,580
Then I'm going to buy an electronic behavior gold like this

1347
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,000
According to the price to be able to 5 million is too low

1348
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,040
But now it doesn't have to

1349
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,880
Send it to a company to work with our company

1350
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,140
They can help you quickly

1351
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:35,040
Just charge you two thousand yuan

1352
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,280
OK

1353
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,540
so what

1354
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,240
Because I actually play with this material

1355
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,340
not for this

1356
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:45,540
I have been doing research on this material since 20...

1357
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,340
that...

1358
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,780
It should be said that in 2011

1359
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,040
I will publish the first article

1360
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,740
i won't talk about that detail

1361
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,340
The whole idea is this

1362
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,580
because we have a very accurate

1363
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,280
This self-owned land gives us all the materials

1364
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,080
I just told him

1365
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,680
That is to say, Jinwoyin should be placed very, very close

1366
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,040
Then how do I do this thing? I want to control it well.

1367
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,560
Then this approach becomes an interesting one.

1368
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,980
If you bring a girl, you will risk your life

1369
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,540
grind it very very flat

1370
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:17,060
Otherwise, female grinding flat is not a very soft girl

1371
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,320
not a very

1372
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,720
not a very safe thing to do

1373
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,520
Because all the acids you need are explosive.

1374
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,280
Then let's treat it as this Yangji

1375
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,200
Then it moves one by one like this

1376
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,040
Then I will use another acid to make this strong

1377
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,440
it likes to have a strong cons thickness

1378
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,720
it decides by itself

1379
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,360
You just need to choose the voltage and it decides for itself.

1380
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,160
This is completely under its own control

1381
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,640
As far as you have only one control, you choose the voltage

1382
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,400
Then the distance between its movement and movement is determined by it

1383
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,000
Then the size of its hole is also decided by it

1384
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,520
Then you'll think

1385
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,120
Then I have this tube because I already have it

1386
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,200
So the wall of this quad is too thin

1387
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,120
I can just open it up and corrode it

1388
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,760
into another acid

1389
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,080
And then when it's done it's

1390
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,040
then i become

1391
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,900
This student from a master’s university did a thing that is the first time in the world to do everyone

1392
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:11,460
That is, I can fix the size of each silver particle

1393
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:16,540
Then the distance between to adjust

1394
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:24,100
The point is that what we care about now is the diagonal seam between these two

1395
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:28,100
The point between the two sets is not close enough

1396
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,740
We need to be able to accommodate it

1397
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:31,940
It does a series like this

1398
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:34,640
Then this is an electron that is clearly and imminently waiting

1399
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,840
The distance between is to five nanometers

1400
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,040
Let me tell you about five nanometers. I have just shown it to you.

1401
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:44,140
The rest of my atom group is three atoms or about five nanometers

1402
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,840
Five nanometers means roughly the distance of fifteen atoms

1403
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,200
That is, we almost count the distance atom by atom

1404
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:55,240
Then the front of such a nanoparticle with a distance of five nanometers

1405
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:58,440
is a world record and is still a world record

1406
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,940
That's because of our approach

1407
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,500
So it is easy to make very large area

1408
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,700
I have brought my samples here

1409
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,500
Wait a minute and I'll open it up for everyone to see

1410
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,500
see you will feel like saying

1411
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,000
no habit

1412
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,500
doesn't look like anything

1413
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,000
why spend so much time doing

1414
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,700
Then the particles it wins are placed like this

1415
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,500
Put them here one by one

1416
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,000
then we'll go and see

1417
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
quickly

1418
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
when we do it in a very delicate way

1419
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
you can see

1420
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Win one by one and grow very, very well

1421
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,500
Then the distance between them is regulated very precisely.

1422
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:36,000
Then this one applied for a US patent in 2006

1423
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
In 2008, he got the patent in the United States.

1424
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Such a wafer technology to make this nanosilver array

1425
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
get a U.S. patent

1426
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Then in 2009 we put this technology

1427
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:57,000
After one year, it will be transferred to a listed company in Taiwan

1428
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
At that time, when Win was listed, it was called Hongkang.

1429
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
We bought this at Tech

1430
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Just transfer our technology

1431
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Then I emphasize this thing here

1432
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
It is not for studying bacteria

1433
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
because i just told you

1434
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
what kind of molecule

1435
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
just put it on

1436
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
i can hear it

1437
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So this is a good place to do basic research

1438
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Because basic research has a far-reaching impact

1439
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
So it can be used to listen to bacteria

1440
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
A lot of people want you too why don't you

1441
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
don't do virus

1442
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
In fact, some people also use it as a virus

1443
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Then why don't you test the pollutants in the environment

1444
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Pollutants in the atmosphere

1445
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
These things are molecules anyway

1446
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I can even hear those molecules

1447
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
The availability of this detector

1448
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
is very very profound

1449
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
So Hongfang Technology is a material analyst

1450
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
They figured this thing out

1451
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And now it is actually possible

1452
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
if someone is going to do it

1453
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
just do it

1454
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
they can bring

1455
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Do this kind of service with everyone

1456
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
but you have to ask first

1457
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Why spend so much money to listen

1458
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
That's probably what a schematic looks like.

1459
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
That is to say I have a win array

1460
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
What about the winning array?

1461
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
yes

1462
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
The size and diameter of each won is about 25 years or so

1463
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Then the distance between them here

1464
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I want to express the hot zone

1465
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
this is the place

1466
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
really hot

1467
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
That's when the laser beam hits

1468
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It spawns a common gun here

1469
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
the so-called one

1470
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
The Service surface

1471
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Plasma, no one can understand me when I say this

1472
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
surface plasmons

1473
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
It's the electron over there that is hit by the laser light

1474
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Electrons in active emission are inside this silver

1475
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
A bunch of electrons start shaking each other

1476
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
It's like a wave hit it and it vibrated

1477
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
The interaction effect

1478
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
so that the electron field in the region between them

1479
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
become very strong

1480
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
that looks like the overall effect

1481
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
It's like it's very, very hot in that place

1482
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,140
So a molecule that is unfortunate enough to fall into it gets knocked pretty hard

1483
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:10,180
So the sound it emits is very loud, and the signal you measure is very loud

1484
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:15,860
The entire technology is in such a positive column that the function is in this place

1485
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:22,500
So we use this method to make the surface enhanced light source

1486
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:32,240
When you make a new technology, it has been 20 or 30 years longer than others

1487
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,480
Compare it with the traditional method

1488
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,920
So what's the traditional way?

1489
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,840
or you take the silver and mess it up and make it rough

1490
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:43,800
Etch it with various amounts of acid, or which piece of glass you make

1491
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,920
It's got some silver, let's just put some silver on it

1492
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,760
That's the traditional signal two

1493
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:56,480
It is mediocre, only here seems to have a little special frequency

1494
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,480
then this is our signal

1495
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,080
very clear this

1496
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,000
It is probably ten times better than his traditional ones and more than a hundred times stronger.

1497
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,800
That's why many people ask, why do you have such a loud voice?

1498
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,600
Then everyone will measure everything

1499
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,200
But there are still many complicated things that I can't talk about today.

1500
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,200
always a very interesting development

1501
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,800
so that we can really do this so-called

1502
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,000
When the shooter uses this word, it means to shoot

1503
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,600
In order to save the surface enhanced spectrum

1504
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,400
It's a long story to slow down the spectrum bottom plate

1505
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,800
So I call it the shooter blade technique

1506
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,000
If you want to measure various molecules

1507
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,800
It can be measured quite well under different concentrations.

1508
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,800
After doing this, we will start talking

1509
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,600
What the hell do we have that thinks so is the amplifier

1510
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,800
such a sensitive amplifier

1511
01:04:53,800 --> 01:05:00,000
If the method posted next to a certain house is called an amplifier

1512
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
If you eavesdrop on the music in that POP next door

1513
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
It's too loud for me

1514
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
It's too low for me to hear

1515
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
So I need to pick certain topics to listen to

1516
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:19,000
It just so happened that the person we cooperated with was Professor Lin Qihong from Yangming University.

1517
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Professor Lin Qihong is currently the director of our Taipei City Health Bureau

1518
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Director Lin said most of the time

1519
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
You're doing a great job and we're here to do this for you.

1520
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Their interest is probably to study the various manifestations of hygienic creatures

1521
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Hygiene, everyone's first reaction is to say

1522
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Hygienic can you know what he probably passed by so listen to his so-called voice

1523
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Does this know what kind of hygienic creature he is?

1524
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Or can you ask about when this hygienic product was poisoned?

1525
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
how did he react

1526
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
So questions like this are what Professor Lin is more interested in.

1527
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Then of course we have many others

1528
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Today I mainly talk about a large part of the cooperation with Professor Lin

1529
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Then I will use a graphic to compare with you what you did before.

1530
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
In the past, everyone was an example of producing some nano-silver

1531
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
then grow some bacteria

1532
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Then put them together like a muddy one

1533
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Then measure a spectrum

1534
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
That's what he said

1535
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Then he published an article

1536
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
This was published in LNKM Water, a well-known chemical journal

1537
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
and say that's the sound of germs

1538
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
tell him it's right

1539
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,000
And then many years later when someone else does it

1540
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Both of them are like this

1541
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
So everyone seems to be claiming that it's the sound of this bacterium

1542
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Someone said it was the sound of the bacteria

1543
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
because he is very, very much

1544
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Why

1545
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
because he's just so hard to repeat

1546
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Because everyone's formula is different

1547
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
then really in the end

1548
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Because my straight man said he came from the voice of bacteria

1549
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Then your bacteria live in a different environment

1550
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
he has different molecules

1551
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Then eat differently

1552
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,120
So even the same type of bacteria

1553
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,920
He may hear different voices

1554
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,920
because he emits different molecules

1555
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,760
So this repeatability is a big problem

1556
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,400
Then it was more like

1557
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,000
It's all fairly stable

1558
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,960
This is a beautiful result

1559
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,320
this is a

1560
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,920
This is a

1561
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,520
The spectrum of bacteria in our big factory

1562
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,840
It's pretty similar to what we did the first time.

1563
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,200
Bacteria like them

1564
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,000
Dachang bacteria

1565
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:24,760
you go and see

1566
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,120
His screen also has some

1567
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,720
Silver particles are placed at the bottom

1568
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:28,720
that same back

1569
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,440
Look at his silver particles like this

1570
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,920
Just put them one by one like this

1571
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,920
That's under the exact same index

1572
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:37,440
Our silver array looks like this

1573
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,320
make it bigger

1574
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,280
Look at each one like a pebble

1575
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,480
Then every time I think about it myself,

1576
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,880
my reaction to that germ

1577
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:46,880
that's how it feels

1578
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,320
That is to say, it is like being in the sun

1579
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,520
Then we find some frogmen

1580
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,320
and drop it on this pebble beach

1581
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,440
like the troop on super ice

1582
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,720
and make them feel

1583
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,320
Then do the hard work over there every day

1584
01:07:59,320 --> 01:07:59,960
various

1585
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
make a move over there

1586
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,300
And then the sound they give off goes like this

1587
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:06,720
The way we did it before is that

1588
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,160
The pebbles on the beach are messy

1589
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,160
then everywhere

1590
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,060
then we are very very even

1591
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:14,160
still very very good

1592
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,760
Well, if you want to go down carefully and talk about this

1593
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,300
What does the whole image look like

1594
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,340
that is

1595
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:25,100
I spread the bacteria on such a

1596
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,160
win array above

1597
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,100
That's probably the bacteria

1598
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:31,140
Underneath each bacterium is actually

1599
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,100
Paved

1600
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:33,400
This servo map doesn't have that much muscle

1601
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,700
Under every bacterium

1602
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,900
From our scale

1603
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,600
Under each bacterium is paved

1604
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,160
An example of one or two thousand winnings

1605
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,600
under a bacterium

1606
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,340
because of that

1607
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:46,860
The sawfish between that sawfish is

1608
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:48,340
around 30nm

1609
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:50,400
It's between the sawfish and the sawfish

1610
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,100
Sawfish 30

1611
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,140
Of course the bacteria looks like a microphone

1612
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:55,060
So it's 30 times 30

1613
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:58,900
There are a lot of examples out there

1614
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,060
There is a light in there

1615
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,740
This is the shell of a cleanser bacteria

1616
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:06,840
Each piece is drawn according to size on this picture

1617
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,040
This is 25nm, this is 5nm

1618
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,360
Bacterial shells probably use these to stand

1619
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,560
Probably a sentence of 7 or 80 nanometers

1620
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,360
That light will penetrate the whole bacteria

1621
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,860
So this blue part is talking about the inside of the bacteria

1622
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:21,760
So if you draw according to this rhythm

1623
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,320
The real bacteria is about the size of the roof

1624
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:25,360
live so big

1625
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,560
It's such a big thing that the color light shoots in

1626
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,780
then the distance

1627
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:31,880
Bacteria no matter what it emits

1628
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:36,480
Or the signal on the wall that is about 10 nanometers nearby

1629
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,020
the sound of those molecules

1630
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:40,920
we can all hear

1631
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,880
So I just gave you

1632
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,480
Let me show you those spectra

1633
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,580
It's actually a big chorus

1634
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:51,320
It's a lot of molecules together

1635
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,560
the overall effect is taking place

1636
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,760
Not just one bacterium

1637
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,760
is a bacterium

1638
01:09:58,760 --> 01:09:59,920
exudes a lot

1639
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,860
many molecules those molecules have in common

1640
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:05,860
A shimmer of vibration

1641
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,540
Bacteria can explain to you a little bit here

1642
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:10,860
Basically, there are two classes

1643
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:13,460
It is the Yangshi bacteria in Ge'an City and the Yinshi bacteria in Ge'an City

1644
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:15,740
The whole category is roughly like this

1645
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:18,140
Then they wait a minute and I will tell everyone to see him

1646
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:19,940
Anshi Yangshi Bacteria

1647
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:21,940
He has a typical scrambling voice

1648
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:24,240
When there are molecules under these

1649
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,740
He has a very, very loud voice

1650
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,900
is 733

1651
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,900
Guo Shu

1652
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,900
Wait a minute and I'll explain this to you 733

1653
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,900
Just what you want to say about 733 times

1654
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,900
But this time we have to multiply by

1655
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,900
Three times ten to the tenth power like this

1656
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,900
Another kind of example

1657
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,900
Anshi Yinshi Bacteria

1658
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,900
Everyone is most familiar with Escherichia coli

1659
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,900
That's what everyone often hears about bacteria in Yangshi, Anshi.

1660
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,900
Botrytis aureus

1661
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,900
This is one of these two types of bacteria

1662
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:54,900
Then there is this category

1663
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,900
Molecular infection

1664
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:59,900
Molecular infectious bacteria look like tigers

1665
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
It has co-existed with us humans for thousands of years

1666
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Mycobacterium fidgetii

1667
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Mycobacteria

1668
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Mycobacterium Naficella is a very, very tough home

1669
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
it can hide inside your body

1670
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Then never get sick

1671
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
wait until you're older

1672
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
it just started to trouble you

1673
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Another branch of mycobacterium is let us

1674
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Everyone has a lot of text settings

1675
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
that's where we are

1676
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
we are over there

1677
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
we are over there

1678
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
we are over there

1679
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
we are over there

1680
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Many texts are set to be leprosy

1681
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Leprosy is also a type of mycobacterium

1682
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
those two

1683
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
What about this type of infection?

1684
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Mycobacterium

1685
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Its spectrum is like everything else

1686
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
big difference

1687
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
just the same

1688
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
let's wait

1689
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I will probably let everyone listen to this voice

1690
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
how did it play

1691
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Then I'm going to

1692
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
heard about it

1693
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
not really us

1694
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I just heard that go to the room

1695
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
not really our biggest concern

1696
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
What we are actually more concerned with is that

1697
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,440
How did Xixun react when we poisoned him?

1698
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,160
because why

1699
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:07,720
Because if you're going to talk to someone who does medicine

1700
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:13,440
For example, when we talked with the doctor of National Taiwan University

1701
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,400
They said you should not tell me which strain it is so detailed

1702
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,960
Because I only have three medicines

1703
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,920
One is isolated positive bacteria

1704
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,120
One is specialized in medical isolation type negative bacteria

1705
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,640
Then the other one is the plum fungus

1706
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,680
Just tell me these three

1707
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,720
Anyway, I only have these three options for medication.

1708
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,120
you won't tell me too much about medicine

1709
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,120
Just tell me these three

1710
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:33,320
Then I started taking drugs

1711
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:36,320
if you don't tell me

1712
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,400
Then I will download all three

1713
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,680
Then when the time comes, let’s talk about the abuse of antibiotics anyway.

1714
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,200
It's because the upper management told me not to use it.

1715
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,600
But from the patient's point of view

1716
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,840
our family is dying

1717
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:48,040
Of course you just drop all the atomic bombs and everything

1718
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,920
And then it looks like there's something going on

1719
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,200
When you are about to die, there will be one less and one less

1720
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,280
see if he survives

1721
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,800
you usually look like this

1722
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,040
So antibiotics say no to abuse

1723
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,160
It's actually very difficult

1724
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,000
that sentence i said

1725
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,760
I didn't say it, but they took it and tied it all down

1726
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,440
This is what Mr. Ke Wenzhe told me

1727
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,700
Because Mr. Ke Wenzhe is the boss of a Korean doctor in our cooperative team

1728
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:17,140
As far as the medicines probably cost money, there are probably four types of medicines

1729
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:21,200
The first way to think of attacking others is probably

1730
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:26,200
The hardest, and easiest-to-shake method

1731
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,300
Just when the family is splitting

1732
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,600
to attack, that is to say

1733
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,600
Being careful doesn't mean growing up, his shell always grows up

1734
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,700
So I figured out a way to stop him from growing out of the shell

1735
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,300
Or break his shell, because he wants to grow

1736
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:43,400
That doesn't end up growing, there's always a weakness

1737
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,100
If you cut him off at that time, he will list the information

1738
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:51,300
It's a kind of shell that's attacking his cells

1739
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:58,600
The other is the synthesis of proteins that go in and attack his cells

1740
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,000
Don't let his protein cells

1741
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,160
probably won't last

1742
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:06,840
The third way is to directly turn the entire outer shell of the cell into a

1743
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,840
This is also the fourth

1744
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:12,840
The fourth is the process of how to make the DNA in it

1745
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:13,920
let's keep fucking it

1746
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,040
then fix it

1747
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,040
it won't survive or grow

1748
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,640
A germ can't kill you

1749
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,680
Would you be a million short

1750
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:20,680
A bacterium will not

1751
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:21,880
you are afraid of it

1752
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,080
You have no reason to be afraid of cockroaches

1753
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,520
But you're right to be afraid of germs

1754
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,160
Because if the bacteria arrive

1755
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,840
copy two two two two every half hour

1756
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:34,320
At the time of the twenty-fourth square, it will soon take up the reputation of this body

1757
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,720
Therefore, it is only needed when the calamity is small

1758
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,000
Ant, you don't need to be too nervous

1759
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
But when you start to lose sight you just get nervous

1760
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,360
By the time I can't see it, it's already thinner than your hair

1761
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:49,080
Your hair is about 100 micrometer

1762
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:53,800
The bacteria I'm talking about is your hair and cut it into a hundred pieces

1763
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,840
into a million

1764
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,520
one hundred

1765
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,840
One Hundred Feet Zun

1766
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,020
We're probably just starting to say yes, then we'll read on.

1767
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:05,380
We read it from bacteria

1768
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:08,100
You can see the result of the next reading, that is to say

1769
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:12,580
I have written about the birth and death of bacteria after we read it

1770
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:16,420
So it was a joy to start him reading Bacteria

1771
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:19,660
Like a whale in the bottom of the sea singing his own favorite song

1772
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:21,960
Just the same spectrum doesn't change

1773
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:22,660
just keep walking

1774
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:26,260
At 50 minutes, he suddenly knew and said wow

1775
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:28,620
He's already been attacked.

1776
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:31,580
So his entire spectrum has completely changed.

1777
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:34,140
then to the last

1778
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:36,300
After waiting for a while, he answered the spectrum again

1779
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:37,620
I won't talk about that detail today

1780
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:40,420
In fact, we've had a lot of work on this spectrum lately.

1781
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:41,460
What exactly does that mean

1782
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:42,660
we have a deeper understanding

1783
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:44,460
But today we don't like him

1784
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,620
Remember these numbers the point is to say

1785
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,300
about a pinhead

1786
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,500
Bacteria already feel his pain

1787
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,980
Then start teaching

1788
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:56,140
Then we'll give all kinds of medicine

1789
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:58,060
Teacher Lin Xuhong and his laboratory

1790
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:59,260
There are various

1791
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,940
All kinds of poisonous hands, they all have a way to do this

1792
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,440
So what they do is

1793
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:07,480
If you're off the drug, you'll be fine listening to him all the time.

1794
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,360
There are such drugs as

1795
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,960
Drugs of this class that grow on the epidermis of the main segment bacteria

1796
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:18,300
That's 55 minutes 45 minutes

1797
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,840
about an hour or so

1798
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,260
They bacteria start to give birth

1799
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:24,600
His so-called procreation means

1800
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,840
There is a huge change in Optics Valley

1801
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,000
It's that voice that sounds sudden

1802
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,440
You thought you were listening to the cello

1803
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,200
suddenly became sona

1804
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,500
or something

1805
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:35,880
what it sounds like happened

1806
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:36,880
so

1807
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,960
The other category is to

1808
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:42,200
During protein synthesis in the main segment bacteria

1809
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,160
sounds reasonable

1810
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,300
quite reasonable

1811
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,600
idiom like flame

1812
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,360
After waiting for half a day

1813
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,760
12 hours later

1814
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:51,160
Bacteria finally suffocated

1815
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,040
hold for half an hour

1816
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,560
After half a day, I finally couldn't take it anymore

1817
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,300
started giving birth

1818
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:56,840
this is very interesting

1819
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,360
see this time

1820
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,000
Actually for this matter

1821
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,140
Especially an instant detection response of wanting to heal or something

1822
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:05,440
may be useful

1823
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,920
they are

1824
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:10,240
Such a method fast one

1825
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,800
detection

1826
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,620
Then directly observe in the monitor

1827
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:17,920
Such an instant response technology

1828
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:18,940
they are interested

1829
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:23,040
Then we sat there and wanted to say

1830
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,060
what are we going to do next

1831
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:26,360
Already talked to him and it sounds like it might work.

1832
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,160
The next step, of course, is to be the station master.

1833
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:31,240
Just say yes, or you can catch a few bacteria to really catch them all.

1834
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,800
what bacteria to catch

1835
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,100
The first one is that of course we will go to school to catch

1836
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:36,600
why

1837
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,680
Our real science should not have bacteria in it

1838
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,500
If there are bacteria, it is called

1839
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,540
Bacteriology certificate or university certificate

1840
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,080
when you catch bacteria

1841
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,380
it will be painful

1842
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:49,160
That

1843
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,440
These

1844
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:53,760
It's about time. I can, maybe, tell a few jokes.

1845
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,040
that is

1846
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:58,640
That's because when I started doing it, I started going around

1847
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,920
ask and report

1848
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,500
We're going to send the machine to National Taiwan University Hospital

1849
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,300
That's when I started to know

1850
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:07,500
What is played in the Japanese contact drama is called the white drama tower

1851
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:08,500
in this way

1852
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,000
That's the one

1853
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,200
No matter how you say it, you have to go over there and bet on a small place.

1854
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,300
The machine will be given to you and then what?

1855
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,300
Send an assistant to help you with the experiment

1856
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,700
you don't spend a dime

1857
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:21,100
you just let us come here with you

1858
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:23,100
Then I will report the result to you after finishing

1859
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,800
Why don't you go in?

1860
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,900
Later, I had no choice but to find Dean Yang at that time.

1861
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,100
Yang half time

1862
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:32,400
Yang Banshi worked very hard to help us explain

1863
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,600
Then one day I met Principal Li at that time

1864
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,000
Principal Li Sicheng

1865
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Principal Li told me about this

1866
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,100
Yang Banshi

1867
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,200
Yang Banshima is not enough to legislate

1868
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,800
I should be more capable

1869
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,000
National Taiwan University this

1870
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,700
only two are fourteen

1871
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,000
one is medicine

1872
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
hospital director

1873
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,200
The other is the principal

1874
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,500
so there should be a way

1875
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,600
After he finished speaking, there was an interval of five minutes

1876
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,600
he wants to say

1877
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,000
I think I probably can't do this

1878
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,900
What do you call a white lens?

1879
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Then Mr. Yang is very busy

1880
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,520
Then go talk to the dean of the medical school

1881
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,720
Talk to the director of the hospital

1882
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:11,360
We are finally in the department in the important town

1883
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,760
just find a place

1884
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,240
a very small corner

1885
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:16,320
Then you can help others to do experiments there

1886
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,800
It's totally free

1887
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,000
to help people do experiments

1888
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,920
It's so hard to do this thing

1889
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,560
Because it's from the Congress

1890
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,720
Nanostate project

1891
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,920
So they want us to have some industrial applications

1892
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,960
So I personally spent a lot of effort

1893
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:29,720
then do this

1894
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,560
Of course the first thing is fine

1895
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,680
Then you're going to catch bacteria

1896
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,640
like say

1897
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,160
Yang's bacteria are

1898
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:37,800
That is the feeding machine

1899
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,920
If you really want to catch bacteria

1900
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,800
Then go grab and release the flasher

1901
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,800
That's when we caught the machine first

1902
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,680
otherwise how did you come

1903
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,400
Is it necessary to find a way to catch it?

1904
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,680
Then we later had a professor

1905
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,320
this is the one

1906
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,720
He was my blogging researcher at the time

1907
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:52,800
Professor Liu Dinghong

1908
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,920
Now at the Department of Materials Science at National Taiwan University

1909
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,560
He proposed a method at that time

1910
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,960
Just count all these things

1911
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,400
Du on the array surface we win

1912
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,300
Wangu Homestay itself is a medicine

1913
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:11,800
It's actually a tool next to the connection of the protein

1914
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,200
Wangu Homestay is a medicine

1915
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,800
this thing is interesting

1916
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,300
Why does medicine help you catch bacteria

1917
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:20,000
This thing is intuitive

1918
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,400
It's funny looking back now

1919
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,600
But it was just a sense of fact

1920
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,100
It turned out really well.

1921
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,400
like here is to say

1922
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,400
It's just a little lower on top of my floor

1923
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,200
The place of Wangu B&B is just a little low

1924
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,700
Then this little low size

1925
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:38,800
This one is only about ten or fifteen microns.

1926
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,300
a small area

1927
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:45,200
Where there is a low place, the bacteria will be in the water

1928
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,400
Then just shake it and wait

1929
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,500
wait ten or twenty minutes later

1930
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,500
found that bacteria only stick to this

1931
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:51,400
I caught the bacteria

1932
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:54,300
like say put some in there and run countdown

1933
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,900
Or in fact, it is more like the previous Margin Camp

1934
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:58,100
that warehouse paper

1935
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,500
Just put a meal here

1936
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,000
Then

1937
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,300
When I come back from get off work, I will watch it for three and a half years

1938
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,080
Everyone will feel that this

1939
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:07,000
Think of medicine as a catch thing

1940
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,700
Then it can be used to measure the tiger

1941
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:13,300
This is a semi-accidental discovery

1942
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:16,700
This result quickly attracted the attention of many people.

1943
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:18,200
actually looking back

1944
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,700
I just said that when building this thing

1945
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,600
Actually, I have a logic in my heart

1946
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,300
The logic is this is to say

1947
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:25,600
why the medicine works

1948
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,600
In fact, we have used the medicine for a long time with great motivation.

1949
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,100
don't even know why it works

1950
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:36,000
In fact, we are still looking for the philosophy of medicine

1951
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,800
There is actually no difference between the license plate of the mayor of Shenlong

1952
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,100
We are not much stronger than Shenlong City

1953
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:43,100
We just agreed on what kind of molecule I would synthesize.

1954
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:44,800
Then I'll try it out

1955
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,300
If it is effective or not, it will continue to moisten every day if it is effective or not

1956
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:49,200
that's the whole thing

1957
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,700
like vancomyle knows it works

1958
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:53,500
it's been a long time

1959
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:56,200
But how to kill the bacteria

1960
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:57,900
this matter to this day

1961
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,900
It is not very clear that

1962
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,280
because that mechanism is a hard problem

1963
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:06,140
But effective energy is a test method that can be used to do

1964
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:09,740
Wangu plum tree has been known for thirty or forty years

1965
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:12,800
I was thinking about my opinion on the matter

1966
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,260
It's four steps

1967
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:16,820
If the everlasting plum tree enters your studies

1968
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:20,420
cells everywhere

1969
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:22,780
Or if the classmates stick together

1970
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:26,180
Then you must be carrying a lot of weight

1971
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:27,980
Then you are already dead, right?

1972
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:29,540
then he must have a way

1973
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:32,380
It's like the key and lock method

1974
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,980
he goes to find something he likes sticky

1975
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:36,780
Then if he is effective against bacteria

1976
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:39,340
He should be with him at least like to be close together

1977
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:41,220
Under such a concept

1978
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:43,340
we just do some searching

1979
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:45,980
The everlasting plum tree happens to be here half a year at this corner

1980
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:49,900
But recently we've made some very subtle discoveries

1981
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:53,260
How on earth did the plum tree accumulate and develop this bacteria sticking in it?

1982
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,860
Actually there is a very interesting story

1983
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:56,940
Then I hope after a year

1984
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:59,180
I can tell you a better story

1985
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,800
As a result, the result of the measurement is like this, that is, when you took ten thousand shares of plum trees and pasted them

1986
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:14,200
Where the amount of bacteria is not added to the plum tree, the red snowball prefers to stick to it

1987
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:17,900
The place where the plum tree is added is that the bacteria prefer to stick to it

1988
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:21,500
Just when you're elected, it makes some sense to our intuition

1989
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:26,600
If Wangu Meishu likes to stick to your red snowball when it goes in, then something is probably wrong with you

1990
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:30,700
If you take one injection, you will die first, and the bacteria will not be there, because it can't find the bacteria

1991
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:34,000
Then go to your student's side and beat around, and then let the red snowball go on it

1992
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,300
so this whole afternoon looks like fun

1993
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:41,200
Then it turns out that the relationship between time, I think I must find some time

1994
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:44,200
Then broadcast the sound of bacteria for you to click off, otherwise there must be members

1995
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:47,900
As a result, of course we spent a lot, the team is very big

1996
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:50,600
Spend a lot of time researching and saying, if we really want to be useful

1997
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:53,300
How to improve the settings of the instrument

1998
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:58,500
What our lab is doing is probably, all the labs use such equipment

1999
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,000
that is

2000
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:06,140
The equipment used in the lab is phantom active

2001
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,220
equipment is expensive

2002
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,280
It was the Zhuangren circle who gave it to me

2003
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,080
i will give my experience

2004
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,120
brought it and bought the machine

2005
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:19,460
To the team I work with at Yangming University

2006
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,780
The way I work with him is to say who and which team member needs

2007
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,340
give him the machine

2008
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,880
Then write a letter to laugh with them

2009
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,980
I told him about the machine I'm giving to your co-op team

2010
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:33,020
then can you give him a space

2011
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,560
After asking for half a day

2012
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:35,580
finally reached

2013
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,380
Do you have a hard time giving you a small room

2014
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:38,920
you send that phantom machine

2015
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:39,940
Then we sent a

2016
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:40,960
until now put

2017
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:42,500
So it's really good to work with me

2018
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:45,560
that machine

2019
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:48,380
very very strict

2020
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:49,920
Many things are very elf

2021
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:53,000
I just saw that most of the materials are made from such machines

2022
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:54,280
but you have to put

2023
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:56,580
You can't put a phantom machine in the hospital

2024
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:57,820
that phantom machine is too big

2025
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,600
That big hospital every time

2026
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
There's only one piece of each and it's that big

2027
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Put hundreds of cameras in

2028
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
So start my co-op partner

2029
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
the long-term cooperation

2030
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
It is Wang Jingqiao from the Tie Center of National Taiwan University driving the car

2031
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
At once

2032
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,000
designed to make the whole thing very, very small

2033
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
a microscope, then a spectrum

2034
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
or something, take it all

2035
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
It's a bit table-oriented

2036
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Then we also put a machine in the Central Administration Bureau of Taiwan

2037
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
because of careful research

2038
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
May be to P2 Level

2039
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Mainly what we do over there is mycobacteria

2040
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
that machine

2041
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
When students go in, you all operate N95

2042
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I go in every day and do experiments like that

2043
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
that was a very, very hard experiment

2044
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,000
that requires very little space

2045
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
and then inside the life safety cabinet

2046
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
So there are actually a lot of sad stories in it.

2047
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I don't talk about time today.

2048
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
that if

2049
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
If you stand down, just say yes, if you may want to be in

2050
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
really smaller space

2051
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
then you are the one

2052
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,000
The machine doesn't need to be so good, then you can make something like a desktop

2053
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
So put the whole design to say

2054
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,720
My wafer is the one that can put the wafer

2055
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,920
That chip is for biologists to get used to

2056
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,400
So our chip is basically made in

2057
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:15,360
Just make it what everyone is used to

2058
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:18,640
It's the Bone Noodle House

2059
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:20,120
This is it

2060
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,760
this product

2061
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:25,760
look

2062
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,760
It's like a pixel

2063
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,760
if you speak directly

2064
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,760
this is above

2065
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,760
yours

2066
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,760
You don't take it, you keep hitting it

2067
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,760
a little bit of what you see above

2068
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:39,760
so just a little click

2069
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,760
Simple and feels like the upper half

2070
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,760
is your button

2071
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,760
that's it

2072
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,760
relatively stable

2073
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,760
That's dense enough

2074
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,760
then one by one

2075
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,760
what does your fingerprint sound like

2076
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,760
right

2077
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,760
Then it becomes very

2078
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
for the entire process

2079
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
or give us the possibility to generate very quickly

2080
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
many such detectors

2081
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
You think of it as an amplifier

2082
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
and then you stick it on something

2083
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
you have the opportunity to hear the molecular voice

2084
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Do you want to listen to basic training?

2085
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Because we found a partner who happened to be doing basic training

2086
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
If anyone here would like to hear other

2087
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Or like to eavesdrop on what other people are saying

2088
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
don't care

2089
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Then of course I still have the answer to my dream

2090
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Because I just said that those are small ones.

2091
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Jihun is 1 million smaller than us

2092
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
1 million times

2093
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
why so big

2094
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
It's a big deal for Kihun

2095
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
big to the first step

2096
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
unbelievable is

2097
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
People are weak

2098
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
less popular

2099
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
to do

2100
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
if the real future

2101
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
if to do

2102
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
make it such a big one

2103
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
hand in hand

2104
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,500
So this is pretending to be a photo

2105
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,000
Then we follow this photo

2106
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
and then like this

2107
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
just not the same

2108
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Separated things should then still

2109
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Just put it on the back of this photo

2110
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
is twitter

2111
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
That's my bacteria from last night

2112
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
what song did you sing to me like this

2113
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,500
that's a good idea too

2114
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,000
so

2115
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
The technology of miniaturization is not a

2116
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
real problem

2117
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,500
The problem is in the self-preparation of the sample

2118
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,000
Get the samples and prepare yourself

2119
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I managed to get into National Taiwan University Hospital this year

2120
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,500
What you do in pain every day

2121
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,000
those things are not my specialty

2122
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,500
It turns out that those are the expertise of life scientists

2123
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:38,000
How many molecules are there in that

2124
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,500
There are many, many molecules in a drop of blood

2125
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,000
those molecules in the end

2126
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,500
meaning that he may be in

2127
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:44,500
At least find a child, right?

2128
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,000
Then you'd be making a fuss

2129
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,500
then how on earth do you listen to him

2130
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,500
Why did you stop him from happening first?

2131
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,500
Then hand it over and get rid of it first

2132
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:52,000
why this whole bunch of things

2133
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,500
It was when you were experimenting

2134
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,500
very simple

2135
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,500
I'm so happy when I'm writing a thesis

2136
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,500
Then when the reporter was waiting for the meeting

2137
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:00,500
nor

2138
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:06,720
Very happy, not very happy, but my collaborators are very happy

2139
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:10,320
There are three minutes left, let's listen to the sound

2140
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:18,060
If this speaker does not broadcast sound, please donate a little more money when you go out, and you will finally be like this

2141
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:34,460
This is Mr. Dachangan, what you have measured is such a light map

2142
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:44,860
I will play this main one, according to this size, the 10 most important and louder sounds, I will start playing according to the loudest sound

2143
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:50,700
The background sound gets rid of it first, that's the kind of background

2144
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:13,400
The ten sound waves I picked, I have a lot of waves, I can also make all ten sounds cooperate

2145
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:17,800
At the beginning, did anyone recognize the 700-odd sound?

2146
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:23,100
Can anyone tell me that it is really a positive frequency of 720 or so

2147
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:27,200
Then this is mycobacteria, so let's remove the background

2148
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:45,100
Louder, louder, louder, louder

2149
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:51,000
The wave size of its sound is related to its volume, the higher the volume, the more and longer the volume of my wave

2150
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Then this is very interesting, this Pip is in seven hundred and thirty-three

2151
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,200
This is Staphylococcus aureus

2152
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,580
All Glanz Yang Zhijun has this one strong signal

2153
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:05,000
I've been talking to him for five years

2154
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:42,280
Why must follow his 8 points

2155
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,840
In fact, there are infinitely many low-pitched

2156
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:46,840
which sound is dishonest

2157
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:49,840
good

2158
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,840
next

2159
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:56,840
I can't do this look anymore

2160
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,840
good

2161
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
just use this air

2162
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:07,580
Well, at the end of the speech, thanks to the people who actually did the work

2163
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:10,580
people who actually do things

2164
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:13,580
People who are squinting and rolling their eyes are usually right.

2165
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:15,580
So I'm just thinking about it

2166
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:20,420
It was the three of us who went there together

2167
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:21,920
This phenomenon of speech in life

2168
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:25,580
The life speech that awards us the Lord

2169
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:26,580
please stand

2170
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:29,580
He is Wang Jianchang

2171
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:30,580
adults are there

2172
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:33,580
he is also avoided

2173
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:36,580
He is the current member director

2174
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:38,580
so you are in our building

2175
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:40,580
I saw one in the medical room

2176
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:41,580
That's the one

2177
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:43,580
Photo by Li Hong

2178
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:45,580
he holds the award

2179
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:47,580
that good name that didn't last long

2180
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:49,580
He felt that he had seriously misspoken it.

2181
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:51,580
His name is Li Hongpi

2182
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:52,580
He also wants to promise you

2183
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:54,580
please stand

2184
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,600
It was sold to the general district of Minse City

2185
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,500
He is also a material master

2186
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:37,060
He helped us do half of the related

2187
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:40,400
This is my assistant Zhou Beita

2188
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:43,360
sent in the one who risked his life to do it

2189
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,940
that situation

2190
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:46,640
of our group

2191
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:48,540
The sense of branching in that situation goes

2192
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,240
is a lot of things

2193
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:53,740
That's Dr. Han

2194
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:55,000
National Taiwan University

2195
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,660
Prescription Medicine for Critical Illness

2196
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Follow the gymnastics from the Corleys

2197
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
That's because everyone knows that

2198
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Music in Taiwan is in very bad shape right now

2199
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
So there are four major interfaces

2200
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
important reset

2201
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
All doctors are unwilling to come

2202
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
A non-surgical

2203
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
So he's got it now

2204
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
He wants to be that Zifan himself

2205
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Zifan's Zizi

2206
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Then you have two kids

2207
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Then you have to talk to Mr.

2208
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Zifan's Zifan wants to be with him

2209
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
there are these

2210
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I want to read that again

2211
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
very very right to him

2212
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
This is it

2213
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
when this powerless

2214
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
he wears a high heel low

2215
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
just pronounce it

2216
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
gotta find that

2217
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
very big

2218
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
great indicator

2219
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
A very important payment is

2220
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I just found out that it is Red Soup Technology

2221
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
if

2222
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
If someone is buying refills

2223
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Mr.'s complement

2224
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Just make another one if you can make up for it

2225
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
make some adjustments

2226
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:00,800
Gongzi Park

2227
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:05,200
In the end, I would like to thank everyone for your advice.

2228
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,600
Of course he would like to thank the National Guest Association

2229
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:08,240
There are many universities in Zhuangdui

2230
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:09,800
There are many universities

2231
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:12,140
then this is

2232
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:14,480
I want to invite everyone

2233
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,280
You have seen our host come

2234
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:17,600
so let me mention

2235
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:18,800
Thank you everyone

2236
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:21,800
platform one by one

2237
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,340
Because our article was published

2238
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:25,740
When the article about drama was published

2239
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:27,600
This enters everyone

2240
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,140
then i will stop here

2241
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,140
almost time

2242
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:31,680
exactly twenty minutes

2243
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:32,780
answer the questions

2244
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:33,480
in this way

2245
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:34,880
ok thank you all

2246
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:44,820
that just had

2247
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:46,180
after already having an audience

2248
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:48,180
That continuous sound is not good

2249
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,280
then we start

2250
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:52,080
that Q&A

2251
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:53,640
good

2252
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:54,580
Committee members

2253
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:55,780
Um

2254
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:57,780
Thank you teacher for your wonderful speech

2255
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:59,480
i think that place is

2256
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,840
I mentioned that there are many kinds of antibiotics

2257
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:05,760
In the experiment, we just talked about Wangu B&B

2258
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,080
Your information just now said

2259
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:09,520
it's the outer skin of that cell

2260
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:12,080
However, there is another data

2261
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:15,920
Seems like a new one for protein synthesis

2262
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,280
But protein synthesis is in that

2263
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:20,040
Occurs in the center of large cells

2264
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,400
like you just said

2265
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:22,720
If the area of ​​the slide

2266
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:23,920
that would be a big one

2267
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,080
those things

2268
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:27,000
when contained in the middle of the cell

2269
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,440
your technique doesn't mean

2270
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:32,120
Should be close to that win

2271
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,840
It will be strengthened around that

2272
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,640
then you are so far inside the cell

2273
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:36,800
can't you hear it

2274
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,160
In fact the most likely

2275
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:39,040
I'm guessing of course

2276
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,360
because i didn't see

2277
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:41,880
that most likely is

2278
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:42,960
In fact, it's been a long time

2279
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,680
that cell

2280
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,240
bacteria are alive

2281
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:48,800
so when its insides start to get attacked

2282
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:52,560
and it starts emitting all kinds of different molecules

2283
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,360
Then our goodness is actually

2284
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:57,920
The molecules emitted by the so-called scream

2285
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,480
will eventually run until there is some running

2286
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,240
what sounds do we hear when we come outside

2287
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:07,240
Then please don't ask me which molecule those sounds represent

2288
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:11,240
I've been doing this for so many years, I only dare to tell people

2289
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:15,440
I wish I could say it again here

2290
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,040
I hope

2291
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:20,640
this

2292
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,000
this

2293
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,480
This 732 this Optics Valley

2294
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:27,560
from which molecule

2295
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:30,400
because of all

2296
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,920
Both Galanz and Young's bacteria have a very strong optical valley

2297
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,200
That's not what we saw in the lab

2298
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:38,000
This thing has been seen for 10 years

2299
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,400
I have been telling you for 3 years

2300
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:44,320
You said I wish my lab was the first to know

2301
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:48,760
Which molecule is that sound coming from?

2302
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:50,760
That

2303
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:56,480
I hope I'm still saying the same thing to you in less than 3 years

2304
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:59,240
Doing basic research is a very hard work

2305
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,080
but that thing

2306
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,560
when you see a regularity

2307
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:05,900
Why did Grand City and Yang Shijun have this signal

2308
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:07,900
The thing is that he has a regularity

2309
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:12,800
Like saying why the sun at what time of the year

2310
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,800
the longest days

2311
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,100
When this thing is observed

2312
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:18,800
Then when you go to understand the truth

2313
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,200
You may discover the three laws of overcoming

2314
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:23,400
That's what attracts us

2315
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:27,200
That is, we are in a very complicated and complicated environment

2316
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:30,300
We suddenly hear a constant

2317
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:31,500
the constant

2318
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:33,300
There must be a reason behind it

2319
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:35,400
We have pursued for so many years

2320
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,200
that's what you're asking

2321
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,500
As for saying

2322
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:39,500
people want to ask me to talk

2323
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:40,800
Is this word going to be useful? It's useless

2324
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,200
Those things because of nano-country new Spanish

2325
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:45,500
Ask me every day if there is any industrial application

2326
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:46,200
i have to say

2327
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,500
How much is the output value

2328
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:49,500
let's talk to him

2329
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:50,400
if so

2330
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:53,100
I'll sell you a drama for 1 yuan

2331
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,200
Then we all sent

2332
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:57,400
Everyone has a few hundred

2333
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:59,600
a gigabit like this

2334
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,100
so this

2335
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
this is an interesting question

2336
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I think it's the molecules

2337
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
What is the molecule that produces and teaches students?

2338
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
i really have no way to answer

2339
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
And that's probably not the best thing to do

2340
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
because it changes too much

2341
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
when things are too complicated

2342
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
you have no way to answer

2343
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
be a researcher

2344
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Maybe you have to measure whether you are old or not

2345
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I'm about to retire

2346
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Then tell me how old you are

2347
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
can answer a certain type of question

2348
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
All right

2349
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
good

2350
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
second question

2351
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
do you sell that a crazy

2352
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
click it once

2353
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Thanks

2354
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
thank you

2355
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I remember one is

2356
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,000
one of our present human rights

2357
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,000
There is no avoidance of an advancement

2358
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
or like before playing a game

2359
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I think the life of things

2360
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
we are doing such a job

2361
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,000
The white snowball is bigger than the red wine

2362
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Viruses are much smaller than bacteria

2363
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
In fact such a spectrum

2364
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
From Viruses From Viruses Such Spectrum

2365
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
is already done

2366
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I didn't do it because I didn't want to

2367
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
but because of dealing with viruses

2368
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,000
I talked to him at the original branch

2369
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
when i was studying bacteria

2370
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,000
All of our directors know how to make brows

2371
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
The lab guy next door said you were crazy

2372
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
It's you who are going to poison us to death

2373
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
you are going to kill us

2374
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
So the purpose of my coming today is

2375
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,000
speak forcefully

2376
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Professor Xu Mingda's point of view

2377
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
is to give bacteria you supply

2378
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
you have a kilo

2379
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
I have a kilo

2380
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
then you tell me

2381
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I'm all comrades tell me

2382
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
you are going to kill me

2383
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Who Killed Who?

2384
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
I do not even know

2385
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
I'm for this matter

2386
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I had to write another one

2387
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
The Industrial Plan of Science and Technology Development Fund

2388
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,600
Then let's study what are xenobiotics

2389
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:04,480
someone was asking me before

2390
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:05,720
I am studying xenobiotics

2391
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:07,820
Our laboratory only studies xenobiotics

2392
01:41:07,820 --> 01:41:09,700
You're wasting your yogurt every day

2393
01:41:09,700 --> 01:41:12,700
Then recently I found a very interesting topic

2394
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:16,220
I just wrote a letter today to a professor at the Central University

2395
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:21,220
He is a xenobiotic of lactic acid-susceptible bacteria cultured from breast milk

2396
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:23,600
this is a very interesting idea

2397
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,100
Because many children develop allergies

2398
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:28,800
The problem with every system is that they don't drink breast milk

2399
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:34,700
If we feed him xenobiotics from breast milk

2400
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:39,600
Then this thing may be a very, very likely effective motivator

2401
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,000
that's interesting

2402
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,800
is the real effect of xenobiotics

2403
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:47,000
The FDA all over the world has not said that he has an effect

2404
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,500
That's what the manufacturers say

2405
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,800
'Cause what they say they say the whole show

2406
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:54,500
No one can say he is right or wrong

2407
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:57,400
After that, there is another kind of xenobiotic bacteria that say yes

2408
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:00,000
After drinking it, you can adjust your figure

2409
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I would also like to study this

2410
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
I'm currently working towards that direction

2411
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
For fear of being kicked out of National Taiwan University by my colleagues

2412
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
So I'm going to start today by announcing

2413
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
please go out and talk

2414
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Professor Wang is studying probiotics

2415
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,000
May I ask if the Virus has any sound?

2416
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
yes yes of course

2417
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
As long as it is a molecule, it will have a sound

2418
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
The voice actually says

2419
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
atoms themselves do not oscillate

2420
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Then you take two green, green atoms

2421
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
become a blue molecule

2422
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
it's right there when it rises

2423
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
you can measure its frequency

2424
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
that can now

2425
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Can this be applied to

2426
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
the flu one

2427
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
theoretically possible

2428
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,000
But sample inferiority and collaborators are very important

2429
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Then if there is a Virus

2430
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
It's the influenza researcher.

2431
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
their laboratory

2432
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Whether it is a P3 or P4 laboratory

2433
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,920
Let's go and help him set up something like this

2434
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:06,240
As long as he chats with me so that we all have a good time

2435
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:09,320
I'm willing to send a set of machines over there to study with him

2436
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:09,740
in this way

2437
01:43:09,740 --> 01:43:11,180
i am very patient

2438
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:15,840
For example, when we went to the Jilin Pavilion, we have sent that machine in for three or four years.

2439
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:18,380
We have not published any articles

2440
01:43:18,380 --> 01:43:19,840
did not publish any articles

2441
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,280
we just keep doing it

2442
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:25,100
This is a philosophy that I personally do research on

2443
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:30,020
Then I am not worried that Dean Synchronization sent me away

2444
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:30,980
right

2445
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:32,900
no two small problems

2446
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:36,380
One is Xijing's stage

2447
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:37,820
that situation

2448
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:40,580
Reaction of the young and old

2449
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:43,140
There is another problem

2450
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:46,660
What's the reaction of Xijing's mix together?

2451
01:43:46,660 --> 01:43:49,180
These two things are what I really want to do

2452
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:51,700
but i can only tell you now

2453
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:52,940
that's all mine

2454
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:56,140
Just told my students the other day it was all mine

2455
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:57,540
dream thing

2456
01:43:57,540 --> 01:43:59,380
but it's very interesting

2457
01:43:59,380 --> 01:43:59,940
of course i will

2458
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
I put a careful one over there

2459
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
then he watched him grow up

2460
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
that side grew up

2461
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
when he split

2462
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,000
He must have different molecules coming out

2463
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
At the moment when we are about to divide

2464
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
does he exude

2465
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
when the child was born

2466
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
This and that miserable student

2467
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
maybe everyone knows

2468
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Many female compatriots know

2469
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
That was when Mr. was beaten

2470
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
is also miserable

2471
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
That miserable student

2472
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
can we hear

2473
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
This is all my Dream Experiment

2474
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
But I've been speaking for five years

2475
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
My students get married and ignore me

2476
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
so

2477
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
every time i tell them

2478
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
This pair of XI-DEM

2479
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
then they all said

2480
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
yes teacher

2481
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
You are all XI-DEM

2482
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
so

2483
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Okay, thank you

2484
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Thanks

2485
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
turn off

2486
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Hello Mr. Wang

2487
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
I am in the doctor's office of Beijing Medical University

2488
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Now pronounce it Cantor

2489
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Cantor's social development

2490
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Do Cantor

2491
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Metastases

2492
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
to transfer that research

2493
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Just started

2494
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Then what I want to ask is a

2495
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,220
Expert in Pharmaceutical Physics and Chemistry

2496
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:05,420
The problem with the second temperature is

2497
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:07,080
You recently saw the article

2498
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:08,660
in cancer cells

2499
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:10,780
this cell it is doing

2500
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:13,060
when it floats in the water

2501
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:15,660
Then use laser two spectrum to pull it

2502
01:45:15,660 --> 01:45:18,100
How do you know this Optic Tracer

2503
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:19,460
Nayu that characteristic

2504
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:20,900
How Q is it?

2505
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:21,900
that elasticity

2506
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:24,620
can represent how vicious it is

2507
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:25,780
Then from normal cells

2508
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:27,580
one gets worse

2509
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:28,860
this becomes diversion

2510
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:29,700
cancer cell

2511
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:31,340
Finally it will transfer to that cell

2512
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:33,380
Its elasticity is getting more and more Q

2513
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:35,420
So the question I want to ask is

2514
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:36,700
Lamination

2515
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:39,300
Cells can be studied in the middle of floating objects

2516
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:41,220
me because of my stuff

2517
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:42,460
to magnify the matter

2518
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:43,460
it can only be pasted

2519
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:45,340
So this is the limitation of this technique

2520
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:46,500
then you don't need to do this

2521
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:49,180
You can consider doing Laman

2522
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:51,460
That's because the cells are really big

2523
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:52,820
so you know it floats over there

2524
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:54,340
Then you use an Optic Tracer

2525
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:55,740
after grabbing it

2526
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:57,860
You use laser light on it

2527
01:45:57,860 --> 01:45:58,740
same laser light

2528
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:00,180
you measure its luster

2529
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:11,000
You hope to directly get the slow and wide service under the different pulling force of the cell itself

2530
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
you can get it

2531
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,000
I don't know how to explain it after pulling it

2532
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,000
But this is a very interesting experiment

2533
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:23,000
But I also tell my students that it is also my dream experiment.

2534
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:27,000
But if you want to do that, you are welcome to come to our lab to do it

2535
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
good

2536
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,000
That Wang novel is because a lot of people just talked about the virus

2537
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Well, we have that insect virus.

2538
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Then this is usable and has been approved for safety.

2539
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
So a virus that is absolutely harmless to humans

2540
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
and it can be saved

2541
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Then this is

2542
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
You'll go viral in no time

2543
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
real

2544
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
What about the flu virus just now?

2545
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
The flu virus is indeed that they are very unkempt

2546
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I don't know what happens to people's stomachs

2547
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Then I don't have a virus now, but I am infected with a virus, and I look neat

2548
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
So I guess it might be better to read the light map

2549
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Then it involves the pick you just mentioned

2550
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
What molecule does it represent?

2551
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Maybe it's infected with a virus

2552
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,000
I said that insects can help with a similar answer

2553
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
That means we can take that

2554
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Influenza's surface protein called Hemagotinin

2555
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,000
It is the obvious element that is the most important antigen

2556
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,000
can be transplanted onto virus-infected surfaces

2557
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
So in this case

2558
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
You can read that molecule's pick

2559
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
I'm guessing because I'm leading the way and don't understand at all

2560
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
but i mean, the flu

2561
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
a lot of protein on it

2562
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
You can't quite figure out exactly what protein you're reading about

2563
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,000
But if you move its protein to the time when the virus is infected for 3 minutes

2564
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,000
You will see, because the infection virus must have its original spectrum

2565
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Then you have one more protein, the protein is quite big

2566
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
you will see a special pick

2567
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I'll start off by saying that we maybe the two of us should sit down

2568
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
like the failure to say that two people chatted

2569
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
yes , yes , are dating your colleagues

2570
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Today's A election is not suitable for talking about such reality

2571
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,260
short story just one sentence

2572
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:04,940
that is, not every molecule of every

2573
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:06,100
I just showed you the vibration

2574
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:08,440
you can hear every sound

2575
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:11,140
because it has the problem of choosing symmetry

2576
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:13,840
So there are some vibrating mannequins

2577
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,780
it is impossible to vibrate out

2578
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:18,380
so you're pretty sure

2579
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:20,040
I put this protein on

2580
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:23,080
doesn't mean you can hear it

2581
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:24,780
this is called

2582
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:25,620
in quantum mechanics

2583
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:27,080
selection problem

2584
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:29,360
So this is what we're going to talk about in more detail

2585
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:30,860
When it comes to this level

2586
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:32,520
I think we are more suitable to do in

2587
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:34,760
the two of us wait a minute and we'll go get coffee

2588
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:36,260
Then make a model

2589
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:38,060
mold

2590
01:48:38,060 --> 01:48:38,460
OK

2591
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:40,800
It's more appropriate for us to talk in private.

2592
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,500
OK

2593
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:44,400
good

2594
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:47,040
Teacher, your speech is really touching

2595
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:49,780
Then the question I want to extend is to say

2596
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:51,940
Because the current platform is

2597
01:48:51,940 --> 01:48:53,880
is on the fix the plate

2598
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:55,280
Is it possible for us

2599
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:57,780
convert it to a format

2600
01:48:57,780 --> 01:49:00,100
For example, it looks like a pig

2601
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,740
Is it possible for him to become like a missile?

2602
01:49:03,740 --> 01:49:07,000
Go to our Target with something like this

2603
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,280
For example, cancers that are hard to find and detect

2604
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:16,000
Hard-to-find things like lung cancer or soft-slot cancer

2605
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,380
Someone is doing such a laboratory

2606
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:19,380
but that means

2607
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:24,740
is that theoretically you make some molecules on top of the surface

2608
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:27,580
Those molecules are theoretically conceivable

2609
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:31,380
Then he likes cancer and doesn't like cancer

2610
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:34,180
These are our own wishes

2611
01:49:34,180 --> 01:49:35,580
Then go down and find

2612
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:38,780
At this time, let's go back to the issue of the white grass hidden in the Shenlong room that I just talked about.

2613
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:42,380
Then maybe you should talk to Dean Wang Qihui about this issue

2614
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:44,980
Then if the molecule you found has been found

2615
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:47,380
Then I said I'm wrapping it on a magnetic bead now

2616
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:50,380
Then I use magnetic beads to pull it out with a magnetic field

2617
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:53,180
This kind of thing has been done for ten or twenty years.

2618
01:49:53,180 --> 01:49:56,780
Then this has nothing to do with the spectrum we just talked about today.

2619
01:49:56,980 --> 01:49:59,480
Is there anyone doing that kind of experiment?

2620
01:49:59,480 --> 01:49:59,980
doing now

2621
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,400
In fact, someone is looking for

2622
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:02,600
Secure the In-Tool Mo'Share

2623
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,100
For example, our base center

2624
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:06,400
Professor Zhang Yingzhi in the Foundation Center

2625
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:07,600
you can go talk to everyone

2626
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:10,200
He has a special problem in doing this

2627
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:11,400
If so

2628
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:13,700
Do you want to do experiments like that

2629
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:14,600
i don't understand at all

2630
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:15,800
You go to talk to Zhang Yingzhi and the others

2631
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:18,800
There may be a better way to answer more accurately

2632
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:21,700
That's because I'm using the way I'm familiar with

2633
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:23,400
that their way

2634
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:24,900
I'm more obsessive

2635
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:27,100
So you should still talk to an expert

2636
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:27,600
OK

2637
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:28,400
Thanks

2638
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:31,100
good

2639
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:32,900
he first and then you

2640
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:33,600
good

2641
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:34,600
Professor Wang please

2642
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:37,400
The area just mentioned refers to the two atomic groups

2643
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:38,500
be close enough

2644
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:42,600
Or must two nanometer atoms be close enough

2645
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:43,600
no no

2646
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:46,000
Nano particles are not atoms

2647
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,700
inside a nanoparticle

2648
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:50,600
Like the one at 25, there is still

2649
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:54,600
There are 1 million atoms in a particle of 25 nanometers

2650
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:57,700
25 nanometers and 1 million atoms

2651
01:50:57,700 --> 01:50:59,900
So atoms are much smaller than that

2652
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Atoms are very, very small

2653
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,020
i can tell you

2654
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:04,860
Our surface nails are so big

2655
01:51:04,860 --> 01:51:06,860
I dial a layer of atoms down

2656
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:08,860
just dial it down

2657
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:10,060
every atom

2658
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:12,560
If anyone wants to buy one from me

2659
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,740
a dollar

2660
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:14,940
that total cost

2661
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:18,440
Yes, our national budget can last for a thousand years

2662
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:19,840
But I sell you atoms for a year

2663
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:22,240
Our Institute of Atomic and Molecular Research has started selling atoms

2664
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:25,100
Just peel off the top of my nails

2665
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:27,140
Just drop so much every day

2666
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:28,300
so what are you asking

2667
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:30,300
what about this hot zone

2668
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:31,540
The hot zone is these two

2669
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:34,040
Two lumps of a million atoms

2670
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:35,700
This is durable

2671
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:36,940
very very close

2672
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:38,940
by the distance between them

2673
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:42,100
about twenty atoms

2674
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:44,040
when i only have that distance

2675
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:45,940
The laser light in the middle comes in and says

2676
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:47,340
form a strong consensus

2677
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:49,540
Inside those million atoms

2678
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:52,440
and more than a million electrons

2679
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:53,640
That electron flies to the electricity

2680
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:54,940
when you stand up

2681
01:51:54,940 --> 01:51:56,240
they seem to be out of alignment

2682
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:57,440
like a

2683
01:51:57,480 --> 01:51:58,440
one is twice

2684
01:51:58,440 --> 01:51:59,740
right next to your ear

2685
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:00,040
then

2686
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:09,600
That's very powerful, that is to say, the molecule in the middle emits a very intense light.

2687
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:12,800
That's what this whole story is about

2688
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:16,000
It was an unexpected discovery that only two

2689
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:21,800
Then our contribution is that when we turn stupid beans into ice at once, it is the rule of hundreds of millions of rows

2690
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:23,900
make it fast

2691
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:27,700
Then it is like a net to be on top of it

2692
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:33,600
That is a bacterium with a thousand of these nanometers underneath

2693
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:39,000
Therefore, the whole signal is relatively high from the revival and the stability is also good.

2694
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,600
are relative

2695
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:45,600
So the nanometer refers to its distance not its length

2696
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:48,600
Then you refer to each distance

2697
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:53,300
is the distance between the two of them is the interval

2698
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:55,500
Between strong disadvantages and strong disadvantages

2699
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:57,900
Their average distance is thirty nanometers

2700
01:52:57,900 --> 01:52:59,200
there is one in the middle

2701
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
A gap with nanometers is a gap

2702
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:09,000
That gap is still the worst place for the confrontation

2703
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Sound is from vibrations between two atoms

2704
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,000
that's how to strengthen it

2705
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:21,000
It's the function of the flat nanosphere

2706
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Wang Zhongsheng, do you have

2707
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Then you are very reluctant to say

2708
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Hope is by means of visual molecules

2709
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
on a metal surface

2710
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Then the specific light comes down

2711
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
reflected by it

2712
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Specific inside light map

2713
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Then look at the general idea of ​​its molecules

2714
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
in that and that chemistry

2715
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
The Khing Lim Finger that mentions Bohr

2716
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
mention the first layer

2717
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
and then absorb specific ingredients

2718
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Then Yaoqing went back to the basic one

2719
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Tell me which grade you are in first

2720
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I am a sophomore in Yanfeng Middle School

2721
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,260
Then you are very, very good

2722
01:54:02,260 --> 01:54:03,020
you just said

2723
01:54:03,020 --> 01:54:04,520
You're talking about ball picking chemistry

2724
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:05,520
OK good

2725
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:06,400
very good

2726
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:09,020
that one thing is different

2727
01:54:09,020 --> 01:54:11,520
That is also the energy level of the main circle of electrons

2728
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:16,020
Now we're talking about a party between two atoms

2729
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:17,200
Electronic circle is

2730
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:19,600
Electrons are much lighter than atoms

2731
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:20,720
should know

2732
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:21,960
e.g. for example

2733
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:25,320
is the weight of light atoms

2734
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:28,200
It is the difference between the weight of a direct son and an electron

2735
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:29,120
It's two thousand times worse

2736
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:31,520
People often don't understand

2737
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:33,520
The difference between that electron and ours is that

2738
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:36,680
if you are if you are electronic

2739
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:41,520
That light atom is the lesson of the M60

2740
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:43,480
so electrons are small

2741
01:54:43,480 --> 01:54:44,400
will wrap around

2742
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:45,560
Is there just one electron?

2743
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:47,600
Then this electron has various orbital domains

2744
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:49,520
when it starts beating

2745
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:50,720
it also glows

2746
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,120
Then this is the other one called

2747
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:53,800
A spectrum emitted by electrons

2748
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:56,960
That's an electronic spectrum

2749
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:58,400
That's not what we're talking about now

2750
01:54:58,400 --> 01:54:59,920
Talking about a handful of two

2751
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,720
When the golden circles are placed together

2752
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:03,960
One of their mother's relatives

2753
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:05,800
The middle character of these two parent characters

2754
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:07,000
can be proved like this

2755
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,320
like dumbbells

2756
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:09,800
can go over there

2757
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:11,000
It turns out that it can be proved like this

2758
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,720
Then this has a legitimate frequency

2759
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:14,360
this legitimate frequency

2760
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:15,600
That's what I just said

2761
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:17,640
The sound we just played to you

2762
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:20,720
multiply by 3 by 10 the house of the cross

2763
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:22,160
I just lied to you on purpose

2764
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:24,120
Just take that 3 times 10 cross room

2765
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:25,000
just remove it

2766
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,120
So deliberately pretend that there is no such number

2767
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:28,800
then you hear

2768
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,280
It's actually that simple

2769
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:33,200
OK, here's the one that plays

2770
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:35,320
It's all a lie to you

2771
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:36,320
Professor Na Huang

2772
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,200
you just mentioned

2773
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:39,040
no way to know now

2774
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:42,000
That frequency is specially bought a molecule

2775
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,400
is there a way to do this

2776
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:46,760
There is a way

2777
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:48,960
It's theoretically possible

2778
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,400
but that's called need

2779
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,320
very very hardworking graduate student

2780
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:55,000
Well, we don't have people like that

2781
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,640
Thanks

2782
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:57,880
ok one last question

2783
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:05,940
Hello, Mr. Wang, I would like to ask

2784
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:11,680
Because of your research, I remember that there was a press conference last year or the year before

2785
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:16,440
At that time, it was said that this method could quickly screen the pathogenic bacteria of septicemia

2786
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:19,120
Then I want to ask if so far

2787
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:21,360
For example, it was reported by National Taiwan University Hospital

2788
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:24,600
Has that big hospital used this method in clinical practice?

2789
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:26,560
i and they already hinted to you

2790
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:31,120
That is when you start to really face the reproductive world

2791
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:33,360
the pain just started

2792
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:37,400
When you write a thesis, all your imagination is very pure

2793
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:39,240
But when you get a drop of blood

2794
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:42,440
My first thing is that it's still blood from a healthy person.

2795
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:45,520
The nurse lady mentioned it to me first

2796
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:50,880
Teacher, there are many patients' blood in the blood of real patients

2797
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:53,720
Half a barrel is filled with oil floating on top

2798
01:56:53,720 --> 01:56:55,440
Because he eats very well

2799
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:58,560
So eat half of it, maybe the oil will be lower

2800
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,160
just listen to all the voices

2801
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,300
to the sound of oil

2802
01:57:01,300 --> 01:57:04,340
then we have to go on

2803
01:57:04,340 --> 01:57:05,740
So it's all the same

2804
01:57:05,740 --> 01:57:07,540
like there is actually another

2805
01:57:07,540 --> 01:57:09,400
A very frequently asked question is to say

2806
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:11,240
Then, for example, in mainland China

2807
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:12,940
Everyone three together in peace

2808
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:14,800
Is there Sanjuqing'an in the milk?

2809
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,240
Of course, this method can also

2810
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:17,040
It must be all right

2811
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:18,640
There are also people doing such research

2812
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:21,240
The first thing you need to do is put the milk

2813
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:23,740
Other impurities in the milk powder must be disposed of first

2814
01:57:23,740 --> 01:57:25,640
That's all very deep chemistry

2815
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:27,440
Maybe our vice president can answer

2816
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:31,680
I'm just starting to regret it

2817
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:34,980
When my blog researcher was interviewed by a reporter

2818
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:37,880
some of the questions he answered

2819
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:39,340
Because people have a very strange

2820
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:40,940
That's when the reporters start asking you

2821
01:57:40,940 --> 01:57:42,880
The more he talks, the happier he is.

2822
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:43,840
Then Wen Tang said

2823
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:46,080
You decide how long it will take to finish

2824
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:47,840
I said it should be over in 30 minutes

2825
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:48,800
Because we have a close relationship

2826
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:51,840
It'll cool down in about 5 minutes.

2827
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:53,680
But I don't think so

2828
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:54,880
that sample pretreatment

2829
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:57,080
It might take half a day to deal with that or something.

2830
01:57:57,080 --> 01:58:00,020
you really want something that works for the patient

2831
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
It takes a lot of practice

2832
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
So my answer to your question should be clear enough

2833
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
That is to say, we went in very hard.

2834
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Never move the machine in

2835
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Then I have been doing experiments for others

2836
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Every day is very depressing

2837
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Been doing something I don't understand at all

2838
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
just how to put

2839
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
front of blood

2840
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
something that has nothing to do with this matter

2841
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Then I can use a

2842
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Talk about the first sentence of Ke Wenzhe's meeting with me in one minute

2843
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
I asked him

2844
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Dr. Ke

2845
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
this

2846
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Halfblood is really sick, you can see he's dying

2847
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Then there are probably a few bacteria in the blood he sucked.

2848
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
because i'm going to catch

2849
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
then you always give me one

2850
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Just say that I want to go to a mountain as big as a mountain

2851
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
to catch the mountain machine

2852
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Then you always tell me how many machines there are in that mountain

2853
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
I wouldn't miss it

2854
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Ke Wenzhe is very like that

2855
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
like he was repeatedly told on tv

2856
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Professor Huang

2857
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
we should be in this world

2858
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
no one can answer

2859
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
This big question should be taken to the people

2860
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Then of course I don't believe it

2861
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Then I really want to say yes when we

2862
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
so i just say

2863
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
I go abroad everywhere

2864
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Those outside China may want to cooperate with us

2865
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
very big visit

2866
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,000
everyone is about home

2867
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
what you're really doing

2868
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
he also told me

2869
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
1CC inside

2870
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
probably at most 1 to 5

2871
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,000
only tinnitus

2872
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
doesn't seem genuine

2873
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
In that 1CC of blood

2874
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
What does 1 to 5 mean

2875
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,000
let me tell you again

2876
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
1cc of blood

2877
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Then you replace it with

2878
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,000
primary bacteria

2879
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
That 1CC of blood

2880
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
How big is 1CC?

2881
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Because our fund is 1 million times

2882
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
That 1CC

2883
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:43,000
1CC is 3CC in 1 cm

2884
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
then you convert it

2885
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
How big is that soup

2886
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,000
I convert it

2887
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
For Taipei City

2888
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
You put it as high as Seven Star Mountain

2889
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,000
fill it all with water

2890
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Taipei may be completely flooded with water

2891
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
there is a

2892
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Ke Wenzhe is swimming there

2893
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
then you say

2894
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
that's some things to do

2895
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
The difficulty is of course very difficult.

2896
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:07,000
So biologists don't do such stupid things

2897
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Biologists say let's bring it

2898
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Then every half hour it changes to two

2899
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Then do it for another half an hour and it turns into four

2900
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Then just wait for three days, right?

2901
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
and then on the second

2902
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Twenty and forty parties are coming

2903
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,000
catch one

2904
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Then they are all the same ethnic group

2905
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
then you go and listen to him

2906
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Why are you grabbing one, right?

2907
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Then it starts to become something

2908
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
very strange question like this

2909
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
If you catch it, you won't get it, and you won't talk about it.

2910
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
but it's not true

2911
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
So I'm looking for him to catch that one

2912
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Not because I envy you too much

2913
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,000
But because of that one thing

2914
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
to catch him

2915
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,000
There are many physical and chemical grids that are very far away

2916
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Its a very high question in this challenge circle

2917
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
your first reaction is to say

2918
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Then I will take all the water in Taipei City

2919
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Is it all leaking?

2920
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Then I'm the one in the water

2921
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Just dig a hole in the city hall

2922
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,000
The others with that bacterial blue column

2923
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:04,240
Everything can be done in Ximika

2924
02:01:04,240 --> 02:01:05,560
All the other honeys are gone

2925
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:06,720
And then take it off when it's big

2926
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:08,400
it's easy to say

2927
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:09,360
real things to do

2928
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:11,360
Most of the holes are plugged in

2929
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:13,560
then there too

2930
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:14,960
So then you can't pretend

2931
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:16,960
but encouragement from there every day

2932
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:18,120
then just say

2933
02:01:18,120 --> 02:01:19,280
Many questions are asked every day

2934
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:20,280
what's on your mind

2935
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:25,640
So the real world

2936
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:27,840
Actually something that works

2937
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:29,560
it costs a lot of money

2938
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:32,760
These things are far from basic research

2939
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:35,000
So once there is a breakthrough in basic research

2940
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,080
It can definitely help a lot of things

2941
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:38,840
So I'm going to talk about it here

2942
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:40,480
That is to say, Chinese College

2943
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:42,720
Chinese studies are in great need of everyone's support

2944
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:45,240
Chinese studies also need to be resolved

2945
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:48,120
good

2946
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:50,280
I'm usually very good at timing

2947
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:51,720
because it was supposed to be 11 o'clock

2948
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:52,800
end at 9 o'clock

2949
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:55,560
He has two minutes of timeout on his

2950
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:56,000
good

2951
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,320
Our congratulations thank you Huang Yan
