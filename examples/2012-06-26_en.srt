1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Music

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,000
rate

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The important activities of the school to promote science popularization have been going on for many years. Every month, there are forests, biology, humanities, and mountain masters. Scholars and experts from inside and outside the hospital are invited to watch.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We are very happy and honored today

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Please go to the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Center of our hospital

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Dr. Xiao Gaoyuan came to talk to you

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Is democracy a universal value

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Dr. Hsiao is a member of the Department of Political Science, National Taiwan University

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Graduated from Political Science Institute

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Then went to Yale University for Ph.D.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
After I came back, I was at the Academia Sinica

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Zhongshan Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences Cognitive

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Later, after Zhongshan Humanities and Social Sciences was changed to the Center for Humanities and Social Sciences

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
he's always there

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Currently a researcher at the institute

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Bing is also the executive director of the Research Center for Political Thought

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
At the same time, he is also the member of the academic executive committee of the college.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
deputy executive secretary

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Professor Xiao's field of research is

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
History of Western Political Thought and Contemporary Political Philosophy

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
His doctoral dissertation was dealing with

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hegel's Ethics and Politics

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
China's early research on contemporary political theory issues

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
communitarianism

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and related issues of social identity in Taiwan

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
In a short time after Professor Xiao returned to China

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Just because an article was published in the most important political science journal in the West

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Contact Award from the National Science Council

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I was told so far

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There are only three articles published by domestic scholars in that journal

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, this is the first time I heard the name of Professor Xiao

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
In the past ten years or so, he has started with the history of thought and political analysis

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Research on the historical evolution and theoretical significance of Western republicanism

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
There is already a book of five or six hundred pages that will be published by a certain publishing house soon

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What about Professor Xiao?

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Because he is here today, I dare not speak too exaggerated language

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well, if he's not here, I'm going to say

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He's actually a lot of people who have told me

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He is our most important student of the history of Western political thought

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
loud voice he's on so i speak one

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
hope it didn't trouble him

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Democracy is one everyone knows

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But everyone hasn't read a full

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
title of book on democracy and liberty

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Originally, the topic of thought was very difficult to talk about.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Personally, I never had the courage to speak out.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
problems in this area

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
because it is a feast of knowledge

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
talk about things that are too thoughtful and too philosophical

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Difficult to hold the audience's attention

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
but today i believe

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I hope you have enough attention

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But I think Professor Xiao will be able to complete this task

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Give a successful speech on Western political thought

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
His topic today is Is Democracy a Universal Value?

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
as far as i talked to him earlier

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The most important thing for him is to discuss with you

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How does democracy go from a

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Turns out there were negative reviews

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
then slowly evolved into

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,600
Democracy is now a universal value throughout history

62
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,360
Let's welcome the professor with warm applause

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,840
Thank you, Vice President, Hello, everyone.

64
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,240
Well I am very happy to have this opportunity today

65
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,440
Let me discuss with you whether this democracy is a universal value.

66
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,440
such a topic

67
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,560
Then what Chen Rufei Yanggang just said

68
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,560
This feast of knowledge is aimed at audiences of many levels

69
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,800
Well, this is actually the first time I've given a public speech

70
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,520
So maybe lack of experience

71
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,920
Then I will try my best to use Taiwan's experience

72
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,920
And the entry of some ideas of this daily life

73
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,800
But there are still a lot of unavoidable content

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,520
This one of my majors

75
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,920
That is, hope is really like some concepts in the middle

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
and an explanation of its rheology

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,320
But I hope that after the explanation

78
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,920
able to have some

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,600
We might end up at the end for half an hour

80
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Teach Me PowerPoint

81
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Then I suddenly finished

82
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,000
that may have more time

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
we have more time to do a

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,600
a free discussion

85
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Then I am for democracy

86
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,200
We only need one now

87
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,400
very simple one to start with

88
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
without a very complicated definition

89
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,800
Democracy in the language of the West

90
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,000
It is Demo

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,400
Democracy is Demo and Kratia

92
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,000
It's the word Kratis

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,800
it is a greek

94
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,800
So Demos represent a meaning of the people

95
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,200
Then the word Kratia is basically

96
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,000
Power or Authority

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
the rights of the people

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,200
It represents a right of the people

99
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,600
or the rule of the people

100
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
so its this

101
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,400
such a definition

102
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,600
no need

103
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,400
there is a very specific one

104
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,200
a sign of the system

105
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
so so democratic

106
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,400
not just for orientals or chinese

107
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,600
or Taiwanese

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
When I first came into contact with Western thought

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
or cultural time

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It may be very difficult to imagine the concept of democracy

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
even if

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
even the west itself

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
One thing I want to talk about today is that

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
the concept of democracy

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well it's not just in the rest of our society

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
by learning

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and interpretation

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and implement it in our local environment

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
in the western world

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
in the history of thought

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and in actual politics

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It actually went through the same process

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So democracy is a very special value

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
then i hope i can today

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
take it slow and talk it out

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So of course democracy is a universal value

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
this universal value

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Or sometimes we translate into universal values

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Then of course we say that democracy is a universal value

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
or a universal value

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
it doesn't mean

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
For example, we say that the force of gravity

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
is a universal concentration

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
not a universal in the sense

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
a universal

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,160
but we see now

137
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,100
In a current public discourse

138
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,100
so let's say it

139
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,260
that means we would say

140
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,300
Values ​​that every rational citizen should accept

141
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,040
why i use this quotes

142
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,660
or English quotation

143
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,960
Because this is contemporary political philosophy

144
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,760
Some of the more specific ways of expressing

145
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,000
it means to say

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,460
we are talking about democracy

147
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,060
or when the universality of political values

148
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,860
we didn't try to make it

149
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,560
scientists or even logic

150
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,120
or a generality in the mathematical sense

151
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,020
but

152
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,160
course political philosopher

153
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,120
they will use some different ways

154
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,260
a design for some discourses

155
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,720
to illustrate that a rational citizen should

156
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,820
This should of course be the absolute question right here

157
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,760
So what about the report I'm waiting for?

158
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,020
will speak out slowly

159
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,920
That is to say, in the long history of democratic thought

160
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,620
come and tell us

161
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,880
a reasonable person

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,500
A rational person should accept the democratic

163
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,000
Where is the argument for this value

164
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So the meaning of a question in my speech

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
like this

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Then the vice president just mentioned briefly

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Which means we just have to go back and look at history

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Looking at the context of history

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We say that democracy has universal values

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
is a very established thing

171
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Because human beings in this world have been

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Almost most people live in

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
democracy or aristocracy

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
or other systems

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
or dictatorship

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Democratic society in human society

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Only in the very ancient Greek democracy

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
existed for about two hundred years

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And then when it's seen as after

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
not only in the western world

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
anywhere else in the world

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
except very local

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That is to say, there are some habits of democracy

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Then when we talk about democratic politics at scale

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
does not exist

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,780
but it was around the eighteenth century

187
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,140
began to gradually rise in the context of the West

188
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,040
Gradually collide

189
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,540
until almost the twentieth century

190
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,040
when we were in the second half of the twentieth century

191
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,660
Especially the issue of national universality

192
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,240
Especially after the collapse of the socialist state

193
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,160
From the late 1980s to the 1990s

194
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,200
what about that time

195
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,460
Due to a collapse of this ideology of socialism

196
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,360
Then let the Western world produce a

197
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,840
OK, in that state

198
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,760
So is the value of politics already basically

199
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,100
In addition to liberal democracy

200
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,960
That's what they're talking about now I'll talk about it later

201
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,600
A procedural, a liberal democracy, a concept outside

202
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,800
Then the ideology that competes with him

203
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Basically it's all gone

204
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,400
Then such a statement was made in the first half of the night in the 1990s

205
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,760
is very very popular

206
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,900
When I was studying in the United States, there were many discourses on

207
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,000
with a very

208
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
very triumphant tone

209
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
a historical purpose

210
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Like when I was doing research and Hegel said

211
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hegel has a famous saying

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Said that history is the process of displaying the spirit of freedom

213
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
A very practical statement like this

214
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
in the late 90s

215
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
actually there

216
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
sorry early 90s

217
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Also in public forums in the US

218
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
After a package

219
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Become a human history has reached an end

220
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This end point is beyond Liberal democracy

221
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
it's hard for you to imagine

222
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The other value system is the universal one value

223
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
If you know one of those days

224
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
words of public discourse

225
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
will know that there is a man named Fukuyama

226
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Fukuyama Scholars

227
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
put forward such an argument

228
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That is a Hegelian language

229
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Come to the contemporary forum in the United States

230
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
when socialism collapsed

231
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Some remarks made

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,500
Can face the phenomenon of democracy

233
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,460
It actually has a contradiction

234
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,340
This contradiction means that

235
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,960
On the one hand, it is historically

236
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,760
very later

237
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,000
Is of course it when starting with historical experience

238
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,160
in the western world

239
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,760
is very much an afterthought

240
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,200
But a value of our current politics

241
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,540
or a moral sub bureau

242
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,800
when we ask ourselves

243
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,000
Democracy is not our own true value when

244
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,660
Most people will answer

245
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,260
Yes means that this universality

246
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,660
in many countries

247
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,860
Until now

248
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,580
Already compared to the late 1980s

249
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,280
The Disintegration of Socialism in the Early 1990s

250
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Until now

251
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,660
The degree of support for such a view

252
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,460
In fact, it is getting higher and higher

253
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,280
Then I insert a

254
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Chinese and democratic such a

255
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,680
power point means

256
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,220
Democracy is unimaginable

257
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,880
then in the nineteenth century

258
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,460
When we first started contacting the West

259
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,260
It is not easy to imagine the meaning of democracy

260
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,380
So so in the nineteenth century

261
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,380
In the second half of the night, during the time of Yin and Han

262
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,140
This concept was once forced

263
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
translated into multiplayer

264
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,700
A lot of people mess with the tube

265
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,900
Or the petty people take power

266
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,700
There are many other ways

267
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,700
Then until the beginning of the twentieth century

268
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,200
in a very short time

269
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,000
About ten or twenty years

270
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
then he is stabilized

271
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,900
That is to say, to remove such a

272
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,100
judgment of value

273
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,300
translated into civil affairs

274
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,200
or democracy, etc.

275
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,900
Not only that

276
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,000
He is less than twenty years old

277
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,700
Then in the samurai movement

278
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,600
Mr. De

279
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,500
Of course we are well aware of the history of this

280
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,800
There are many advanced

281
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,600
Also did a lot of research

282
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,500
The so-called Mr. De

283
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Mr. Sai Democracy

284
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,100
and Science

285
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,100
is considered to be one of the rescuers of China

286
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,200
Bolfamen

287
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,800
i sometimes think

288
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,700
I have not done research

289
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,900
Why didn't they talk about freedom and science?

290
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,000
there must be a special reason for this

291
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Is there some sense of democracy in

292
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,900
chance above

293
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,700
on the root

294
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,900
There is some kind of power that touches people's hearts

295
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900
Of course we can come back slowly

296
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,900
discuss this matter

297
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
then this is a

298
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
A few weeks ago I went to a

299
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I was invited to comment on a

300
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
A technical article

301
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's not really my specialty

302
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
but in this place

303
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
it is a survey

304
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It is a survey of East Asian values

305
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
A Thing That Investigates Democratic Values

306
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
we invite you to watch this

307
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
this problem

308
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He said democracy may have its problem

309
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
but it is still the best form of government

310
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
This respondent was asked the question

311
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
answer this question

312
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes is 76.18

313
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
such a number

314
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Then such a number

315
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Let's look at the support degree

316
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
it is almost the highest

317
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's the same as this one except

318
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Which country did the respondent answer?

319
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
this is mainland china

320
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It is man in China

321
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Well then I'll comment on that article

322
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Nothing to do with today's topic

323
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
because for him

324
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It produces a very interesting puzzle

325
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
because he said

326
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Another problem is

327
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I would prefer live under our system of government

328
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
any other than I can think of

329
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He replied that freedom is the best system

330
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,940
Then you can live under this system in mainland China

331
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,560
so they empirical people

332
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,440
That is to say, those who make this empirical theory should return

333
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
I want to ask if this is a fake

334
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,680
or he is cheating

335
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,140
Or he's going to make one of these two numbers

336
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,240
make a bond

337
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,640
Said he was going to offer an explanation

338
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,480
Why do people in mainland China

339
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,440
He himself believes that democracy is a

340
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,480
best value ratio

341
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,800
so tall but he

342
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,740
Basically accept the authoritarian rule of mainland China

343
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,640
That's not one of our topics today

344
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,040
All we're going to see is the

345
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,940
A country like mainland China

346
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,040
Then democracy is also a highly supported

347
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,580
recognized one

348
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,480
one political value

349
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,880
So

350
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,280
I will introduce the following Powerpoints to you

351
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,880
I have one for you

352
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,380
the blue version

353
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,480
is one of my speeches online

354
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,340
Then you can refer to

355
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,240
that is

356
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,340
the one that put a backbone of my speech

357
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,180
put it there

358
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,440
But the main text because

359
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,380
Because of space

360
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,840
I still only put it on the Powerpoint side

361
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,080
so

362
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,600
in the following words

363
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Then based on an experience in Taiwan

364
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,400
Let me introduce to you

365
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,140
How do we view democracy in Taiwan

366
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,900
So one of the key points of this issue is to say

367
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,600
Let's go to Taiwan's public discourse

368
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,040
I'm just very simple

369
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,300
As far as I can remember, I took two paragraphs of text

370
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,200
Then you can see

371
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,740
Can't see where this text comes from

372
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,840
Then the first paragraph

373
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,800
this is a quarter

374
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,200
it is a cryptogram

375
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,700
He said Taiwan's democracy dilemma was never really implemented

376
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,400
constitutionalism

377
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,900
This is the spirit of the original text

378
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,900
Constitutionalism emphasizes separation of powers and checks and balances

379
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,400
Advocating the Rule of Law and Defending Basic Human Rights

380
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,900
And strict constitutional government must not abuse power

381
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,100
This is the necessary foundation for a good democracy

382
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,800
However, in the time zone where democracy was in Taiwan

383
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,700
biased towards elections

384
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,900
The essence of democracy

385
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,300
The idea of ​​constitutionalism

386
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,100
not paying enough attention to

387
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,500
As a result, except for politicians who violated the law and abused their power

388
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,700
All walks of life except greed

389
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,200
Jin can't make a difference

390
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,400
So in modern times this is continuous

391
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,300
modern western democracy

392
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,900
even developed successfully because

393
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,500
Keep the spirit of constitutionalism first

394
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,000
Constitutionalism asserts that everyone has inalienable fundamental rights

395
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,700
Government rights must be limited

396
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,000
the constitution of the law makes everyone equal

397
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
follow the law

398
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,700
The administrative system is strictly neutral

399
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,300
These are the basic principles of a democracy against

400
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,500
Despotism or populism please note this opposition

401
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,700
we'll talk about that later

402
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,700
The key is that this is what we pursue for high-quality democracy

403
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,200
do guarantee

404
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,300
So he went on to say that after he came to power

405
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,500
All efforts to implement the core value of democracy are

406
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,300
Constitutionalism has become the consensus of ruling and opposition parties

407
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,800
We look forward to the DPP, of course this is President Ma

408
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,200
A white arm of this constitutional reform at the time of the first election

409
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,500
still available online

410
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,300
Then we expect the DPP not to be subject to

411
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,000
Taiwanese democracy thereby abandoning their commitment to

412
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Surveillance due to constitutional democracy

413
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
We also advocate the addition of constitutionalism, nationalism, etc.

414
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,200
This is a view of democracy

415
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,900
Well, this view is of course what we generally call

416
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,000
constitutional democracy

417
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,000
Then sometimes his value is Liber

418
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
we are called

419
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,580
Liber democracy is the constitutionalism of this democracy

420
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,080
But Taiwan has other

421
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,740
There is another concept of democracy

422
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,680
the concept it says so

423
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,240
building the nation

424
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,000
It advocates the construction of national sovereignty

425
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,540
Principles of National sovereignty

426
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,000
Create a modern constitutional state

427
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,680
Do not touch the principle of national sovereignty

428
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,800
emphasize some governance

429
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,580
between public opinion as a rule

430
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,740
We recommend strengthening direct civil rights

431
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,380
establish the principle of national sovereignty

432
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,080
Let the people know about the law and the affairs of the country

433
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,880
criminal

434
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,280
create referendum

435
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,580
It's ready now

436
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,280
then it goes on

437
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,520
or another paragraph

438
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,220
citizen hair will be 22 million

439
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,380
The people of Taiwan use it to fight against

440
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,380
Chinese regime on the other side

441
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,420
The most powerful force to annex Taiwan

442
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,020
also the last weapon

443
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,280
even say

444
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,980
Even if the citizen's hair is Taiwan

445
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,780
The Last Trump Card of People's Governance

446
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,280
The last line of defense is not an exaggeration

447
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,120
then this is in

448
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,380
Ah Bian's constitutional policy white skin negligence

449
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,580
before the first administration

450
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,120
That is, it was proposed in the second millennium AD

451
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,020
These two are very simple

452
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,340
A discussion in a public forum

453
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,200
Then their writers are scholars

454
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:09,400
I think so but he lays it out nicely

455
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
That is to say, even in a place like Taiwan

456
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,740
in a democratic society

457
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,700
our value to democracy

458
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,240
concept of democracy

459
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,340
In fact, there is still a different understanding

460
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,540
one way

461
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,500
So are we going to say

462
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,400
Democracy is an inherently contestable concept

463
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,200
so-called inherently contestable concepts

464
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,140
a concept in political philosophy

465
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,680
Called Essentially Contested Concept

466
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,380
For example, some concepts

467
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,680
it's so controversial in itself

468
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,780
So it is never possible to achieve a

469
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,780
a precise definition

470
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,380
which itself defines A must have another definition

471
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,680
The definition opposed to it yields

472
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,540
so we call it an essentially contestable concept

473
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,040
Then let's look at the previous two videos

474
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,780
constitutionalism versus national sovereignty

475
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,780
Then populism should be reversed

476
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,080
fundamental rights versus populism

477
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,800
In fact, in the system of different political theories

478
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,300
can be an important element of democratic political theory

479
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,300
But when it is placed in a different context

480
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,300
when it is combined with each other

481
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,300
it produces a different context

482
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,800
Then it will also produce different

483
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,900
A this of public policy

484
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,800
An account of this orientation, etc.

485
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,600
so in other words

486
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,400
Are these mutual democratic concepts Taiwan's

487
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,700
unique

488
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,300
what am i talking about

489
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,500
this is a

490
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,900
This is a democratic political

491
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,500
or the history of the development of the concept of democracy

492
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,400
is a thing that has always existed

493
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,100
So democracy in the history of Western political thought

494
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,600
It is also a concept that is constantly changing

495
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,200
But we will slowly see

496
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,400
During the development of the history of the twentieth century

497
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,300
its competitor is not democracy

498
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,500
please first

499
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,600
Let me tell you one clue first.

500
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,300
That is to say, democracy is often overshadowed by its opponents

501
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,600
Defined by

502
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,100
so

503
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,760
The second century to the end when his universal

504
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,840
The so-called universal value is his antithesis

505
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,800
After its own legitimacy slowly fades away

506
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,200
A very unique phenomenon that arises

507
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,760
Will there be other historical forms in the future?

508
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,960
Can compete with liberal democracy or democracy

509
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,640
That's one thing I don't know

510
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,440
but

511
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,760
Let's see what we've said so far

512
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,840
is indeed a generation of such a general situation

513
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,240
Then in the following

514
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,240
I will enter into my speech and compare

515
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,480
part of the academic

516
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,520
I will go with you as much as possible

517
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,480
in an understandable way

518
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,000
Do an Intellectual History Review

519
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,440
It is a review of the history of the idea of ​​democracy

520
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,280
Then in all the development of political values

521
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,200
Democracy is characterized by a second coming

522
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,880
is a second coming

523
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,200
Why is he a second coming

524
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,160
That is to say, the generation of political value

525
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Whether it is the East or the West

526
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
In fact, generally speaking, it is actually a specific struggle

527
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
or class conflict

528
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
or one of various

529
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
slowly emerged from a de facto political initiative

530
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Let's go for an example

531
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
the concept of country

532
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The concept of the state itself is

533
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
In fact in the English language

534
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
used for the first time in our present sense

535
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
When the country is uncertain

536
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Almost at Hobbs' legislator talk

537
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That is, 1650

538
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Before 1650 there was of course the word State

539
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But that State it represents some status

540
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
is its state

541
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Or it will become our current concept of State

542
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Because it has a meaning of Political status

543
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
that is to say its political status

544
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
For example, the political state of a monarch

545
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Then these are more vague

546
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
daily life terms

547
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
With this political struggle

548
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Then during the English Civil War

549
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,400
with this aristocracy

550
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,800
Plus one of this sect of various religions

551
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,500
In fierce confrontation?

552
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,600
or not hoping to find

553
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,700
we two see or not

554
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
find a higher point

555
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,400
what about this time

556
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,200
The concept of country has been settled

557
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,500
So what's the difference between him and democracy?

558
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,400
Before the concept of the country was settled

559
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,900
The concept of country is not yet the concept of country

560
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,500
That is to say, when we use the word State in English,

561
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,800
The one that pops up in our heads

562
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,000
associated, that, that, that, that, that semantic

563
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,400
no country as we speak

564
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,100
For example, let's talk about the Republic of China

565
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,900
or thinking about the republic of america

566
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,200
We thought of this certain country

567
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,100
But the concept of democracy is different

568
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,600
the concept of democracy

569
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,300
it self in greek city-state

570
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,000
In the first Greek city-states

571
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,500
Once a Democracy Experience Is Determined

572
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,900
So the political value of democracy

573
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,000
is a bit like China

574
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,900
I'm making an assumption

575
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,000
Forgive my material if there are historians here

576
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,900
For example feudal

577
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,260
or Jing Tian

578
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,660
This concept existed 2000 years ago

579
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,660
So

580
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,960
so it existed as a concept

581
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,460
It was in the 18th century or after the 17th and 8th centuries

582
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,100
it re-emerge

583
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,660
it slowly reappears

584
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,660
And after two or three centuries of development

585
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,200
Obtain an overwhelming advantage at the end of the 24th century

586
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,700
So the fact of its coming again

587
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,200
Not exactly the same as other political concepts

588
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,060
at least in my understanding

589
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:35,860
I hope to be able to tell the difference in a very specific way.

590
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,660
so

591
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,400
But the story of democracy

592
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,560
how to tell this story

593
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,960
That is to say, democracy started from the city-states of Greece 2,000 years ago

594
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,060
to modern democracies

595
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,060
or among countries

596
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,460
we become a democratic country

597
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,160
or a democratic society

598
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,660
Is this story a historical teleology?

599
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,320
it's like i'm going to go back and see

600
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,360
Fukuyama said like that

601
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,200
OK let's put this human

602
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,820
a history of us

603
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,140
In pursuit of our autonomy

604
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,140
We pursue this ego governing ourselves and so on

605
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,040
Then such a kind is regarded as a

606
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,440
as one of our most important

607
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,080
Is it to discuss a kind of dignity of a person?

608
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,520
Or are we going to use some social

609
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,480
What about a theory of the evolution of value?

610
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,920
I think it is in our present age

611
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,160
It's probably not easy to say such a thing

612
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,360
I think democracy is a non-intended process

613
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,060
it is an unintended one

614
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,520
It is an unintentional process

615
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,900
as a researcher of intellectual history

616
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,360
I do not believe in a teleology of history

617
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,560
I believe in history

618
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,700
But what I believe is that in the course of history

619
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,900
Historical agency

620
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,940
the actors of history themselves

621
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,200
it will have its ideas

622
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,240
Its perceptions can have an impact on its actions

623
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,980
Of course this effect we cannot say is a

624
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,140
a british influence

625
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,020
it is complicated

626
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,180
For example, how do I understand democracy

627
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,280
Democracy as I understand it and democracy as you understand it

628
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,900
If we are not the same, we will conflict

629
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,700
but no matter what

630
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,200
I

631
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,200
Our actions are consistent with our commitment to democracy

632
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,000
or other values ​​of this concept are related

633
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So what about such a process?

634
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,500
it has several important features

635
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,500
I have translated it into Chinese in my Hand out

636
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,800
So I express it in English here

637
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,200
First

638
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,400
Democracy is a Herman-Newtics

639
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,200
This is probably a rather strange statement.

640
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,000
I had a discussion with a historian a few days ago

641
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,200
That is to say, history is a whole world

642
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,100
sorry

643
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,300
Democracy, the specificity of the presence of democracy that I mentioned earlier

644
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,900
It's an interesting interpretation of an

645
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,300
it has a feature that we call hermeneutics

646
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,500
Why do we say it has a hermeneutic character?

647
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,100
Because it has a Classical Text

648
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,700
it has a classical tradition

649
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,700
classical experience

650
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,100
The main thing is the politics of Yaris Dorda

651
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,900
There is this classical political philosophy

652
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,500
For Greek democracy at the time

653
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,100
and various other monarchies

654
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,900
the concept of the monarch

655
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,100
concept of aristocracy concept of aristocracy

656
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,600
and the concept of democracy

657
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,400
It has a very complete analysis

658
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,900
So it has a text in that place

659
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,400
In ancient democracy, there was a text in that place

660
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,000
But it has a contemporary

661
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,200
A horizon of historical actors

662
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,900
horizon we know it is a concept of the whole world

663
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,100
That's when I'm learning about something

664
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,000
an agent an actor

665
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,200
either an interpreter or a reader

666
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,000
I probably I didn't read this kalama bless bro before

667
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,400
I may have some vague idea of ​​the literature of the book

668
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,800
one thing i want to know

669
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,400
Well, but my understanding is actually

670
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,800
I have read this novel very thoroughly

671
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,300
To various this inside

672
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,800
A very complex science of a character

673
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
and its dialogue

674
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,400
Grand Inquisitor etc.

675
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,500
after i understand

676
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,500
I can come out and say how I probably understand this book

677
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,200
So is a horizon in this place

678
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,200
So this democracy as an interpretation of an experience

679
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,400
this is thinking

680
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,700
The level of not wanting is not at the level of reality

681
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,700
The level of reality certainly has class interests

682
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,800
Then the material struggle and so on

683
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,200
this undeniable

684
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,500
I'm not saying that people are only determined by their ideas

685
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,100
But the idea exists in this place

686
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,000
Then the idea of ​​democracy

687
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Its special place is that

688
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,700
it has a classical text

689
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,600
there is a classical text in that place

690
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,400
as a reference

691
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,700
But an interesting aspect of the nation lies in this place

692
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,300
It is not like Chinese Jingtian or feudal

693
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,300
we say we are in the modern world

694
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,200
To put such a system into our modern society

695
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,300
that often has a devastating consequence

696
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,300
Did democracy have any consequences?

697
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,900
Democracy in the Western world

698
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,000
also caused great political turmoil

699
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,700
This several revolutions

700
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,400
But it's another interesting one

701
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,900
a state of change

702
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,100
or a changing look

703
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,200
We call it recontactualization

704
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That is to say, democracy itself in the classical period

705
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
as an expression of direct democracy

706
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
After he arrived in modern times he was contactualized again

707
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
His value is re-converted

708
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
He transforms into something different than he was

709
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
so what

710
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
The last point is the change of this value of democracy

711
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It is an innovative transformational idea

712
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
That is to say, it is a kind of political value

713
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
mine new a way of changing

714
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So this process of change in democracy

715
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
let me emphasize again

716
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
there is no one great

717
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
great philosopher or great legislator

718
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Said that democracy should be like this in modern times

719
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It's not the ancient one, it didn't exist

720
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
it is in the process

721
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
in generations

722
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
thinkers in the west

723
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
and when it came to the east

724
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Thinkers in the East

725
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
or among historical actors

726
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
slowly forming a

727
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
what we are now

728
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Then, in retrospect of the history of thought

729
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
here only know

730
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
just a simple one

731
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
orange this place

732
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
That is to say, if we look at the history of Western thought

733
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
it has a classical democracy

734
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
This is what we generally call direct democracy.

735
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
that's done in greek sorry

736
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
greek city-state

737
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Especially the city-state of Athens as a model

738
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Then it has the National Assembly and the People's Court

739
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Almost always by lottery

740
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm sorry, the National Assembly and the People's Court

741
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
The National Assembly is open to all citizens

742
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Then the people's court is very large

743
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
is a lottery, almost all Greek institutions

744
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Except for the most important military leaders

745
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
and financial officials

746
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
all by lottery

747
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Lottery is a mechanism of democracy

748
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
then other

749
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Like the big general I just mentioned

750
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
or finance officials they use elections

751
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Elections for Greek Democratic Theory

752
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It's a mechanism for an aristocrat

753
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It is completely different from what we think now

754
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It's an interesting change in a democracy

755
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
in modern democracy

756
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I differentiate it into two

757
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,400
That's just a temporary distinction

758
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,760
Everyone probably knows

759
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,560
A Democracy I Call Substantive

760
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,320
This substantive democracy focuses on

761
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,240
substantial democracy

762
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,040
It focuses on the concept of democracy or the people

763
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,840
Then as a substantive concept

764
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,480
it is based on the will

765
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,800
it strives for equality

766
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,080
Equality is always at the heart of democracy

767
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,200
most important value

768
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,400
Of course now we

769
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,880
Especially the current society in Taiwan

770
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,520
everyone is talking about it

771
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,800
or the identity of ruler and ruled

772
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,400
This is a more philosophical expression

773
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,000
identity

774
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
which means I don't want to have one

775
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,400
Perpetual existence also with a group of my comrades

776
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,800
king or lord

777
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,600
That's what a comrade looks like

778
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,800
what democracy imagines is

779
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,200
No one is gay with anyone other than us

780
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,000
it must be in

781
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,200
in a process within ourselves

782
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,400
in the process of democracy

783
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,000
in the political process

784
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Another concept of democracy is

785
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
procedural procedure

786
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,800
it is free

787
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,200
We sometimes call it Liberal Democracy

788
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
or constitutional democracy

789
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,000
Constitutionalism is well expressed

790
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
this

791
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,500
the meaning of procedure

792
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,800
that speaks freely

793
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,500
is compatible with the constitution

794
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,500
some concepts of liberty we say libertarianism

795
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,700
I'll talk about that later

796
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,500
What about procedural concepts?

797
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,500
it is rational

798
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,700
in front of will

799
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,200
these are two different things

800
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,500
then it pursues a process of rational deliberation

801
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,300
and then reach a consensus

802
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,100
these are two different

803
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,600
modern concept of democracy

804
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,400
What about classical democracy?

805
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,600
is intentional

806
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
So

807
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,500
Let me briefly introduce

808
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,500
The theory of democracy in this classical period

809
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,800
that same

810
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,900
In our look at Greek political theory

811
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,600
words in greek political thought

812
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,300
We can distinguish that

813
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,800
how democratic democratic actors understand themselves

814
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,400
That is to say your self understanding

815
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,800
your self-knowledge

816
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,500
and what do we do with the concept of democracy

817
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,300
what we call scientific analysis

818
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,100
or academic analysis

819
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,500
that democratic self-understanding

820
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
One of the best in Greece

821
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That is, Perecholus' national business talk is Funeral Oration

822
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,600
It is included in the rest of the physical division

823
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,500
Among Borobinissa warriors

824
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,000
Then one of its contexts is a time in Greece

825
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,500
during the battle

826
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,000
Then there is the messenger of the warrior

827
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Then this Perecholus was

828
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,500
leader of the greek nation

829
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,000
So according to the custom at that time

830
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
This is where these fallen soldiers are buried

831
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
During this funeral

832
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
that is to say, made a

833
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
gave a very famous speech

834
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
what this speech is about

835
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
it's going to inspire

836
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
so it's against this family widow

837
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
What about these relatives of the soldier?

838
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
to tell a story about the Greek nation

839
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
worthy of their relatives

840
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
For such a circle

841
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
a very famous lecturer

842
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Of course everyone is interested

843
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
you can find it for reference

844
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
the Chinese translation

845
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
In the Anthology of many nations

846
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
In ethnic Text

847
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Then one of its main

848
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
actually

849
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,380
He said our system is called a democracy

850
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,380
because the city-state has a majority of people

851
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,880
rather than being managed by a handful of people

852
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,380
We see that when the law resolves its own disputes

853
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,380
Provides equal justice for all

854
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,880
equality and justice

855
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,380
then in public life

856
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,700
priority for public office

857
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,000
Consider a person's talents

858
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,380
rather than his social status

859
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,380
or what class does he belong to etc.

860
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,880
Of course, there is a very small paragraph in the middle of the word.

861
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,880
Well but we see a

862
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,380
The key concept is

863
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,380
Democracy is the rule of the majority

864
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,380
So in the future development

865
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,380
For the concept of the majority

866
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,380
What priority does he have to climb this

867
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,380
he has the legitimacy to rule

868
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,380
This is a key question

869
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,380
So let's look at this now

870
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,380
What about Aristotle's theory?

871
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,380
It is different from the previous rest geography

872
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,380
He is an analysis of what we now call science

873
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,380
Analysis of Political Science

874
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,380
Of course we don't call him political science now

875
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Analysis of Political Philosophy or Analysis of Political Theory

876
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,660
it is the experience

877
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,040
it when aristotle collected

878
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,600
Constitutions of three or four hundred small Greek city-states

879
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Then it analyzes the logic of democracy

880
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,240
it analyzes the logic of nobility

881
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,740
It divides Greek society without a monarchical element

882
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,000
This will be mentioned later

883
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,540
so what

884
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,840
It proposes a very complete text

885
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,040
For Westerners, this structure

886
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,740
understanding at that time

887
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,980
and for us modern times in the West

888
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,580
Democracy regenerates an influence

889
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,240
It acts as a key influence

890
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,740
let's see what it says

891
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,080
Then it appears to be a

892
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,080
very simple classification

893
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,780
then it scales with the number of rulers

894
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,580
I think many of the guests may know

895
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,240
It uses a single individual minority and majority

896
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,880
This is a quantitative standard

897
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,640
Then it divides into its rulers

898
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,280
Is it based on common interests

899
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,580
or it follows the ruler's self-interest

900
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,620
Divided into government and debate

901
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,920
It is a correct system and a

902
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,500
perverted is a formal body of corruption

903
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,000
Then he divides into this single body which is the monarch body

904
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,340
good formal

905
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,040
A good orthodox is a monarch orthodox

906
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,300
aristocratic and republican

907
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,340
I'll talk later

908
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,300
So the body of the defense is the founder is terranine

909
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,540
This is sometimes translated into a tyrant

910
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,540
But terranine is a builder

911
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,660
It is a translation that is more neutral than ours

912
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,540
But everyone knows that it is terranine

913
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,000
oligarch is arigaki

914
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,200
or arigaki

915
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,700
But what we saw was interesting in this place

916
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:37,000
The main body of democracy is placed in the main body of debate

917
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,540
that is to say

918
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:45,700
His logical circularity does not mean that the monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy

919
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,700
Founder or tyrant oligarch

920
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,700
or something to put here

921
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,500
There is also Aristotle's political theory

922
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,300
Political Theories Influencing the West for Two Thousand Years

923
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,260
We say he might have some vibe of some democracy

924
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,160
Well, but you go to see Aristotle

925
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
His articles are not many

926
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
for every regime

927
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
his non-existent monarchy for greece

928
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
he clearly pointed out

929
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
The virtue of his ruler is an extraordinary virtue

930
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
use one of us

931
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
A metaphor well understood by the Chinese

932
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
For example, Dahe Zhishui

933
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Yamato was three generations before

934
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Great and before is kindness

935
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
But Da Yu's virtue is so high

936
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
his achievement is so big

937
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
make the people willing to regard him as a monarch

938
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
this is a monarchy

939
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
That is to say, the monarch's morality

940
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
basis of legitimacy

941
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
is a single individual

942
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
a very special virtue

943
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
the aristocracy is

944
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
The concept of virtual virtue

945
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
then democracies

946
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
We see that his actual analysis is

947
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
equal to the liberty

948
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The two principles are equality and liberty

949
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So Aristotle for

950
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Analysis of Democracy

951
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It's not as simple as we are now

952
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
look

953
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,300
You are biased towards him

954
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,220
Of course there is a little bias

955
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,260
Aristotle thought

956
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,560
What does he think is the best form of government?

957
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,960
It's this kind of regime mixed with this

958
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:12,860
so

959
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,920
What about the rule of many people in the regime?

960
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,460
He's called a republic called a Polity

961
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,220
The concept of Polity is a mixture of oligarchy and democracy

962
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,300
He believes that oligarchy and democracy are the same

963
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,920
At that time the Greek two class struggle

964
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,040
The two most powerful classes in conflict

965
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,740
a class of nobility

966
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,340
The worse state is the oligarch

967
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,720
Then the other is the democratic majority

968
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,480
Bad state is democracy

969
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,580
what about these two

970
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,780
It's all over

971
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,180
This fate means the middle of the mean

972
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,720
Aristotle's philosophy

973
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,380
It's a bit like the Confucian philosophy in China.

974
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,480
The golden mean

975
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,880
So these two are Access

976
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,240
The pursuit of wealth or virtue is not considered

977
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,920
pursuit of wealth or virtue

978
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,920
he both he all he is a good thing

979
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,600
Equality and liberty are also a good thing

980
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,400
But what?

981
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,800
they chased

982
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
After it's over, it becomes over

983
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
After that, we need to put two

984
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,200
through some mechanism

985
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,800
This is the city-state

986
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
What about these mechanisms?

987
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,300
mix it up

988
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,600
then become the so-called republic

989
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,500
What about the concept of Aristotle?

990
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,800
It affected this across the West

991
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,500
a political thought

992
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,000
But what I just said

993
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,700
it actually to some extent

994
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,000
There is a stigmatization of democracy

995
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,400
But this stigmatization

996
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,700
Stigmatization in Chinese

997
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,400
pretty ugly

998
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,100
stigma

999
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,240
That is to say, it actually

1000
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,700
missing a label in that place

1001
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,800
But is there a theoretical reason for this label?

1002
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,400
Let's see there's actually a reason

1003
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,700
it says so

1004
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,200
it says democracy

1005
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,700
是the rule of many

1006
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,900
with a view to the advantage of many only

1007
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,100
That is to say, according to its political system and defense system

1008
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,400
if this category

1009
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,200
What about democratic rule?

1010
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,400
is majority rule

1011
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,500
But it only takes care of its own interests

1012
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,700
Then we will still ask

1013
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,500
this right

1014
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,800
our democratic majority vote

1015
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,100
Then cast out one I am now

1016
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,840
The political party you are supporting is a democratic process

1017
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,740
Aristotle didn't see it that way

1018
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,700
Well, but we don't care about this for now

1019
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,140
focus on this place

1020
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,540
Many is in Aristotle's system

1021
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,940
it's just a part

1022
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:20,540
So democracy is either aristocrats or monarchs

1023
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,740
it's all just a part

1024
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:28,300
This part allows democracy itself to have an advantage in numbers

1025
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,400
we are the majority

1026
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,040
or most of us

1027
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,200
we should have the legitimacy to rule

1028
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,300
What about the legitimacy?

1029
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,800
it wipes it out

1030
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,100
or weaken it

1031
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,440
it's about you

1032
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,240
you are all part of the regime

1033
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,940
You are just a part of the cost

1034
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,100
you as a part

1035
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,600
You said you were going to be the ruler with a few nobles

1036
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,240
Suppose he is virtuous

1037
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,760
This place is where we see the difference between ancient times and modern times

1038
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,900
According to Aristotle, a minority elite

1039
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,900
They are of higher virtue

1040
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,400
or better

1041
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,400
We must have the ability to rule

1042
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,640
it constitutes a claim to a justifiable dominion

1043
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,600
But in our modern

1044
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,800
we do not accept the concept

1045
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,140
We'll see why later

1046
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,400
So

1047
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,040
one

1048
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,800
Another important change

1049
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,240
He said this Many is always poor

1050
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:15,740
that is

1051
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,200
it has an iron law

1052
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,700
that is

1053
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,040
Have you ever seen anything in this world

1054
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,200
in any society

1055
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
rich people are few

1056
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,440
the poor are the majority

1057
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,400
He said there is no such society

1058
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,940
So Many will always be poor or common people

1059
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,740
so we put him

1060
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,640
this is his words

1061
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,040
we replace him

1062
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,940
So his labeling of democracy

1063
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,740
that is

1064
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,840
Democracy is the rule of the poor

1065
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,640
with a view to the delineable poor home

1066
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,240
So

1067
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,040
so

1068
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,940
This is the whole of the West until modern times

1069
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,840
for democracy

1070
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,640
after the pro-democracy demonstrations

1071
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,940
what people remember

1072
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,640
Probably just a Greek city-state over 200 years old

1073
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,940
very confusing

1074
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,640
call back and forth

1075
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,140
So

1076
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,560
Even now we look at the history of Western political thought

1077
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,360
In fact, there is a very interesting example that says

1078
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,260
You go to see Greek democracy

1079
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,360
You can't see democracy itself

1080
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,960
Except the rest body is what I just cited

1081
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,200
this fumal ration

1082
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,500
you don't see a theorist

1083
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,200
For this democracy propose a

1084
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,960
how about a system

1085
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,260
A justification of war promise

1086
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,260
why

1087
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,660
because Greek democracy

1088
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,600
Just like our current democracy

1089
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,460
Most of the action of democracy takes place in that field

1090
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,460
all at that civic assembly

1091
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,920
in the people's assembly

1092
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,760
one of them trained themselves to speak

1093
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,820
an ability to stop

1094
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,220
talking about what we should do now

1095
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,660
What attitude should we adopt towards China

1096
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,020
what should we do to america

1097
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,760
What should we do with American cows

1098
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,260
I'm going to convince a

1099
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,700
sometimes one in ten thousand

1100
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,820
a place for gatherings

1101
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,220
this is greek from sophist

1102
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,620
That is to say, the self-reproach

1103
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,820
training this public one says

1104
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,620
A technique for a public speech

1105
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
We now see the familiar

1106
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,800
This stigma went to one of the Roman era

1107
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,600
Greek historian called Polybius

1108
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,200
Polybius made a correction

1109
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,000
This revision affected the later Western

1110
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
He put the democratic court into the political system

1111
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
At this time, democracy is in the context of Rome

1112
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,800
So the Romans were basically gay oligarchs

1113
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,600
The power of his nobility is still great

1114
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,800
But the concept of people in Rome

1115
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,400
is a legal concept

1116
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,600
So they themselves for this

1117
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,400
The Three Elements of Monarchy, Nobility and Democracy

1118
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,400
It is a more balanced consideration

1119
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,200
So Polybius is here

1120
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,600
Orthodoxy

1121
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,800
It is the right system

1122
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
Then variants are no longer democracy.

1123
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,600
He called him coined a word called mob regime

1124
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,000
Then this is more in line with our imagination

1125
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
democracy is good

1126
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,600
That mutant mob, right?

1127
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,600
each has good and each has bad

1128
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,200
what about the really good stuff

1129
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,400
Just now Aristotle had only two things mixed

1130
00:42:59,400 --> 00:42:59,900
that is

1131
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,040
The de facto nobles and commoners in Greece at that time

1132
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,800
Also ample filling for both factions

1133
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,840
two classes

1134
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,840
What now

1135
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,640
It creates another new concept that is

1136
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,640
A mixed constitution is three mixed

1137
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,200
Of course it's because Rome

1138
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,600
He himself before becoming a republic

1139
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,560
there is a shift in monarchy

1140
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,440
So

1141
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,340
re-enter the modern

1142
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,540
Actually I need to go faster

1143
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,140
i found out that time is not enough

1144
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:29,940
So

1145
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,540
i want to talk a little bit

1146
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,840
That is in Aristotle's concept of politics

1147
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,240
i will call it

1148
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,740
Xunhua Democracy

1149
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,840
That is to say, democracy is a

1150
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,140
is a difficult one to control

1151
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,640
a political process

1152
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,040
So it has to cycle

1153
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,440
So the classical theory

1154
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,340
Its cycle concept is called regimen

1155
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,440
called politics

1156
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,640
is pollution

1157
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,640
polythea

1158
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,340
This concept is sometimes used in English translations

1159
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,840
translate it into constitution

1160
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,040
not a good translation

1161
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,760
Now that the better one is translated into regimen

1162
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,560
Although sometimes in contemporary politics

1163
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,200
Regime also represents the concept of regime

1164
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,360
but we are

1165
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,960
I usually translate it into politics

1166
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,400
for a very specific purpose

1167
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,360
So Aristotle for politics

1168
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,240
He brought it up to say

1169
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,400
for official position

1170
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,160
Especially this authoritative official position

1171
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,760
an arrangement of a political order

1172
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,960
Then the point is the next decision

1173
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,760
He said that no matter what type of city-state

1174
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,560
His authority must rest with a ruling body

1175
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,520
That is to say, in terms of classical theory

1176
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,960
The very machine world we just talked about

1177
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,800
Classification that looks very machine-bound

1178
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
His focus is on

1179
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,760
a group capable of forming a mixed rule

1180
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,920
So out of six or three of these pure regimes

1181
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,320
He said, for example, that democracy is

1182
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,400
Democracy is the authority of the common people

1183
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,720
An oligarchy is a minority with authority

1184
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,120
Well but what they hope to do

1185
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,880
this mixed constitution

1186
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,080
His purpose is to bring democracy

1187
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,760
Democracy into a mechanism for a balance of power

1188
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,600
is a balance of power

1189
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,960
So whether it's oligarchs or democracies

1190
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,660
In Aristotle there are only two powers

1191
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,360
or royal aristocrats

1192
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,000
It's Malaysia and Astaksi

1193
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,860
Plus the three forces of democracy

1194
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,960
Three groups of Dingli

1195
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,000
This is from the Western period

1196
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,660
A heart of an art of classical politics

1197
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,960
The entirety of Western politics predates modern times

1198
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,060
It's basically clouded by this analysis

1199
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,900
that is to say

1200
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,100
If you have read Plato's Republic

1201
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,900
It's Utopia

1202
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,360
you will see a

1203
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,160
We are called the Guardian Model

1204
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:35,760
that is

1205
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,900
So the concept of politics in the West is the balance of power

1206
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,160
It is not an

1207
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,000
That is to say, politics should have a professional

1208
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,900
this ruler with true knowledge

1209
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,960
or defenders to rule over us

1210
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,460
not such a concept

1211
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,500
when you look at plato

1212
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,860
You'll see another very specific concept

1213
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,100
But what about that concept?

1214
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,760
In the development of the West, it is not the main

1215
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,400
The mainstream was developed by Aristotle and Rome

1216
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,700
This republic and the concept of mixed constitutionalism

1217
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,700
So I'm going to move on now to our comparison

1218
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,500
actually takes more time

1219
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,300
modern democracy and competition

1220
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,500
then in my mind

1221
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,400
or in my interpretation

1222
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,000
What about modern democracy itself?

1223
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,400
it begets itself because of its competitors

1224
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,300
a repositioning

1225
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,800
a new identification

1226
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,700
So this competitor followed the modern

1227
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,000
A development in different phases of this politics

1228
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,600
Then the earliest ones are State Building and Nation

1229
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,000
Tell us about nation building and democracy building

1230
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,200
What about the construction of this country and the construction of democracy?

1231
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:51,800
Let the concept of democracy revisit Monarchy and Aristocracy

1232
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,200
These two things launched a new wave of a struggle

1233
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,300
It's different from the ancient struggle

1234
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,100
what about after this fight

1235
00:46:59,100 --> 00:46:59,700
yes

1236
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,300
Compared with the later liberalism

1237
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,400
That is, we will see constitutionalism versus despotism

1238
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,440
this concept

1239
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,100
A Concept of Despotism is a Novelty Pro Concept

1240
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,300
Its Aristotelian system does not exist

1241
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,500
the word is greek

1242
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,300
but it didn't exist

1243
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,000
We will see this word later

1244
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,800
It has an influence on China

1245
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,700
Because authoritarian politics refers to Chinese style

1246
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,800
one politics of the monarch

1247
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,100
That is what Montes said about

1248
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,500
Then in the second half of the nineteenth century

1249
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,400
a contender for the last wave of democracy

1250
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,700
It is the social revolution

1251
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,000
When it comes to Marx and the socialist revolution

1252
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Generated another wave of democracy versus dictatorship

1253
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,600
the concept of dictatorship

1254
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,000
Or later when translated into this

1255
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,800
dictatorship of the proteria

1256
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,900
is the proletariat

1257
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,300
officially translated as dictatorship

1258
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,700
But the word dictatorship

1259
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,100
In fact, it is better translated as dictatorship

1260
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,800
But that topic probably won't be discussed today.

1261
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,400
then i'll go back

1262
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,700
The first important context is democracy

1263
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,300
its first

1264
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,960
The first week is related to the modern sovereign state

1265
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,920
The concept of sovereignty is very familiar to us

1266
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,960
But the first definition of sovereignty was in

1267
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,060
not only in the six volumes of treatise on states

1268
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,360
Six Books on the Commonwealth

1269
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,200
a definition it proposes

1270
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,840
Around 16, 16, 70 years

1271
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,520
it says that sovereignty is owned by the political community

1272
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,720
absolute and permanent right

1273
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,640
Absolute and perpetual

1274
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,200
These two properties

1275
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,000
Then this attribute is in addition to absolute and puppetual

1276
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,800
I just talk to you today

1277
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,680
It also adds a very important thing to the discussion

1278
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,280
called indivisible

1279
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,280
Indivisible?

1280
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,720
Democracy and nobility and monarchy

1281
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,120
it produced a different one theory one

1282
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:48,880
not just theory

1283
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,000
that is to say an actual

1284
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,280
A change in the arrangement of our political system

1285
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,640
It is because sovereignty is indivisible

1286
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,120
So it overturns

1287
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,080
The classical common

1288
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,420
he's a balance of power vs a mixed one

1289
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,420
a concept of constitutionalism

1290
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:09,420
That concept is mixing and balancing

1291
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,420
Then a topic that gave rise to a whole new theory

1292
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,420
So there can only be three forms of a sovereign state

1293
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,920
So there are no longer six

1294
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,420
In terms of HOPS, only monarchy, aristocracy and democracy

1295
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,420
The so-called tyrant is just you don't like the monarchy

1296
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:29,620
The so-called mob is nothing but

1297
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,620
you

1298
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,620
That is to say you go to say this person

1299
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,620
I don't like democracy

1300
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,620
say no three things

1301
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,620
sorry

1302
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,620
There are no six things, only three things

1303
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,620
what about this time

1304
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,620
What about monarchy and aristocracy?

1305
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:44,620
they are about to establish

1306
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,620
Who is the sovereign in this struggle?

1307
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,620
in the age of absolutism

1308
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,620
the most important one

1309
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,620
a political issue

1310
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,620
but this time

1311
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,620
yields a classical theory

1312
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,620
A problem that doesn't actually arise

1313
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,620
people are diverse

1314
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,800
People, we are now, we have one hundred and fifty or sixty people here

1315
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,440
Then there are more than 22 million people in Taiwan

1316
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,040
right

1317
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,040
Then among the Greek city-states

1318
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,640
In his heyday, he had about 50,000 people

1319
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,540
but no matter how many people

1320
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,240
He will not appear in the same field at the same time

1321
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,040
How can a multitude of peoples become what we are if we say

1322
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,040
We want the sovereignty of democracy by democracy

1323
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,800
This concept of sovereignty is similar to that of Aristotle

1324
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,340
Talking about the ruling group is different

1325
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,540
Well, at this time, this is what the Chinese have just encountered

1326
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,280
A confusion in the concept of democracy

1327
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,440
That is to say, what is the so-called principle of democracy in this democracy?

1328
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,980
what is the main reason

1329
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,880
Then there is another topic at this time

1330
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,280
I spend a little time here

1331
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,840
Then it will be a little bit more technical

1332
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,480
The rise of the sovereign state coincided with the social contract

1333
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,180
social contract earlier

1334
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,880
But the previous social contract was more religious

1335
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,820
So we're not talking about the social contract today

1336
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,600
The concept of dominant country

1337
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,760
What about the combination of the two concepts of the host country?

1338
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,840
at hobbs

1339
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,800
Is a

1340
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,640
I think it is an ideal theory

1341
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,560
The most distributed and best system

1342
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,360
let's not talk

1343
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,040
that is

1344
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,320
The most compact system

1345
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,880
Hobbes proposed the state of nature

1346
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,600
i don't know how many guests

1347
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,000
Know

1348
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,800
but

1349
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,440
He presupposes equality

1350
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,560
This is a core concept

1351
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,280
people are equal

1352
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,480
in classical theory

1353
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,560
he is not equal

1354
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,160
people are different

1355
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,400
and there is inequality

1356
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,120
Your ability to pursue mathematical knowledge is better than mine

1357
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,160
Your ability to pursue knowledge in the machine world is better than mine

1358
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,960
So you are born unequal

1359
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,360
So he is in a different field

1360
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,720
he can win

1361
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,000
He can be in that field

1362
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,880
become a good one

1363
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,600
There is the same presupposition in politics

1364
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,360
But

1365
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,880
Hobbes' state of nature

1366
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,040
very interesting premise of equality

1367
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,400
but his equality

1368
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,520
not equality in the moral sense

1369
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,360
so he is saying

1370
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,760
in a state of nature

1371
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,160
Although we have physical differences

1372
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,400
Not everyone has the same strength

1373
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,160
it is impossible not to accept

1374
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:07,060
But each has a similar chance of killing everyone else

1375
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:07,760
destroy others

1376
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,400
That is to say, the strongest person

1377
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,000
when he sleeps

1378
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,400
i could stone it to death

1379
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,260
so he don't bully me

1380
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,700
If you say it, you say it

1381
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,300
if you tie me up now

1382
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,000
I can't run of course I obey you

1383
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,100
But you want me to ask you to sleep

1384
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,200
I can't cut the rope and run away

1385
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,100
this has to be justified

1386
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,360
So one of Hobbes' premise is that

1387
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,360
everyone he destroys everyone else's heritage

1388
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,760
This created a generalized mutual fear

1389
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,760
Then he is in an unstable state

1390
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,760
what about this time

1391
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,360
His natural state is called a state of war

1392
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,160
Well, I don't think we'll talk much about this

1393
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,560
But people fight each other

1394
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,760
But Hobbes told a

1395
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,160
Maybe it's our modern reaction

1396
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,160
He said the fear of death

1397
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,060
fear of death

1398
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,560
you are afraid to hate

1399
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,060
you don't want you to sleep

1400
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,060
you are already in heaven

1401
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,460
or face it in hell

1402
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,960
Then he let hit this place

1403
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,960
Please pay attention to this word

1404
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,440
That is to say, people who have not yet become a community

1405
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,840
He is willing to follow the lead of reason

1406
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,840
To create a political community following the laws of nature

1407
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,040
that's how it came

1408
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,640
so hobbes

1409
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,840
If we look at textbooks on the history of political thought in general

1410
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,440
he will tell you

1411
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,840
he is the defender of absolutism

1412
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,000
There is no problem

1413
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,740
But Hobbes' logic

1414
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,280
in many, many places

1415
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,040
influenced modern concepts of democracy and liberty

1416
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,540
This is the Paradox that I want to talk about today

1417
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,180
What about natural ratings?

1418
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,880
His important place is here

1419
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,340
He produced a democratic priority

1420
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,240
why

1421
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,580
This is the original text of Hobbes

1422
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:41,440
He said when people come together to build a nation

1423
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,540
almost as soon as they party

1424
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:44,540
we get together and talk

1425
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,940
how we protect ourselves

1426
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,680
right

1427
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,580
Aware of this, it can be said that he is building a democracy

1428
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,880
people get together

1429
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,640
he is a democracy

1430
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,680
Then from their resource meeting topics

1431
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,240
They are said to be subject to the

1432
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,280
is a decision that is agreed upon by the majority

1433
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,280
And as long as this meeting lasts
