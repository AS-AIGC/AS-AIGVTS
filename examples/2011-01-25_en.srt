Zheyan Rescue

9
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,500
very important

10
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,140
an activity

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,660
have been around for a long time

12
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,140
every month

00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,340
all early

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,540

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
some are

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,700
various university societies

20
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,400
the following

21
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,900
academia

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,200
come talk to everyone

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,700
in various fields

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,500
latest development

25
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,700
i think today we

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
very happy

27
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,500
also very honored

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,800
please come

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,600
Zheyan Rescue

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,480
current director of the Institute for Statistical Science

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,240
Dr. Li Kezhao came to tell you

32
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:19,640
The subject of our knowledge experiment this time

33
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,280
Dr. Li graduated from the Mathematics Department of National Taiwan University

34
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:32,720
He went to the University of California, Berkeley

35
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Practicing a Ph.D.

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
practicing statistics

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,920
He is in residence at the University

38
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:50,320
Go to UCLA

39
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,320
Institute of Statistics

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So he's basically UCLA's over there

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
From Professor Zhu to Distinguished Professor

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Professor Li is engaged in the research of statistical theory

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
His academic contributions are very high

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:41,000
His greatest and most admired contribution by the statistical community is in his most

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What is the Chinese translation? Multi-variate high-dimensional

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Statistical Analysis of Variables in High Dimensions

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The main reason is that the actual

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
in the data used

49
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,600
Whether it is experimental or natural data,

50
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,400
many probably almost mostly high dimensional

51
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,800
Then ordinary statistical methods to study this

52
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,800
is always flawed

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,800
So everyone thought of many different ways

54
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:36,800
To use statistical methods to analyze such complex data

55
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Neither was very successful

56
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,000
Dr. Li invented a method in the 1990s

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,500
It is recognized by everyone as doing this thing

58
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,500
One of the most effective and best ways

59
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,700
So his contribution in this aspect is really quite big.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:14,000
In the last ten years or so, he has put his interest in biostatistics,

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The achievements above are also very large.

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Since he returned to Taiwan six years ago and served as the director of the ten-year research institute,

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
With Taiwanese scholars, especially Taiwanese medical scholars,

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Cooperate with doctors who actually work and use the latest statistical methods,

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Do very difficult, but also very important analysis of biological and medical data.

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He and the very outstanding scholars of National Taiwan University,

67
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,920
Including Yang Pangci, the dean of the School of Medicine at National Taiwan University

68
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,000
Academician lung cancer group

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,560
made recent quite groundbreaking research results

70
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:22,920
These results have been used in practical medicine

71
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,120
Medical top

72
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,960
Today he talked about this topic

73
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,960
apply other statistical methods

74
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Statistical processing and analysis of genetic technology information

75
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,960
He called him chaos

76
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,960
let's welcome him

77
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,120
I choose this topic today

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The first aspect is my interest

79
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
On the other hand, because I know the words of this talk

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
There are many different backgrounds for this listener

81
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
When it comes to statistics, most people are in awe of three points

82
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
My cesar advisor is called prof. Jack Heaver

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He is also a National Academician of the United States unfortunately a year early four

84
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He once said that when he was flying

85
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There's a lady sitting next to me

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Then the two of you chatted and it was very interesting

87
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
what do you do

88
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He said I was a professor of statistics

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Immediately stand alone

90
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
i hate statistics

91
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Because statistics have a whole bunch of companies

92
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
How is it? I don't know what's going on inside

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The words in my talk today

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I want to change your point of view

95
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,280
Because statistics are actually because there are many such computers and so on.

96
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,600
Can help you deal with those company issues

97
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,160
Your company doesn't need to memorize it, you only need to memorize it once

98
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,960
The rest of the things are called pressing a button and everything comes out.

99
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,520
So what the memory worker is is not a very important key

100
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,440
The most important key is statistical thinking

101
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,640
This is a fairly logical thinking

102
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,200
Then this processing data

103
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,720
You see or see some information in the society, etc.

104
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,600
I hope that it can have this statistical spirit in it

105
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,400
Then see a lot of that

106
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,920
It's a social thing and you'll keep it in your heart

107
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,400
The most basic characteristic of that statistician

108
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,520
He just won't believe him when he sees the information

109
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,680
He will answer a big question mark

110
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
so

111
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,360
Is it really like that?

112
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,840
Then I think today although I use the

113
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,400
This biotechnology information

114
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Then I hope that the last message brought to you is a concept

115
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,800
Everyone can use it in daily life

116
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,600
Thanks

117
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,800
Well, that gene we all know now

118
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,000
science is very advanced

119
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,200
The species that says mostly a lot cannot say most

120
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,000
The sequencing of the genes of many species has come to an end

121
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And what about the next job?

122
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,300
biologists rely on some so-called vitamin

123
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,000
this way or vitamin glyconucleic acid

124
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,800
And some Next Generation

125
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,900
This is something that the second generation is sequenced to and so on

126
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,100
generate a lot of data

127
00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Use it to help with complex diseases such as cancer

128
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
research or you are in crops you want to change its important shape

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
For example, genetic factors such as endurance, high yield, etc.

130
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So in so many different fields

131
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Different in the domain of this creature

132
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Everyone uses especially the same nature of these materials

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Then how to rely on this computer to wait for this

134
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
grant to do this analysis of the data

135
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
find out the rules

136
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Well that's an interesting question for the guy we do the stats

137
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Because there are so many variables involved

138
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So today I mainly give some simple examples to introduce to you.

139
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And when it comes to statistics, like the average person pays this head on

140
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's like this striking power, like Wang Jianmin's

141
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,920
It depends on how much impact you need.

142
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,000
or some polls

143
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,520
Like how many people win a certain policy

144
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,000
while opposed to etc.

145
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,840
then why did i choose to do this

146
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,320
biology

147
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,160
This time the most important thing is

148
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,520
because according to many people

149
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,720
The so-called 21st century is

150
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,520
Nero, Bio, Info

151
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,800
that is to say

152
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,760
Nero is Namimi's technology

153
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,360
Then Bio is biology

154
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,160
Info is information

155
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,320
The so-called three major technologies of the 21st century

156
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,000
Of course statistics are not here

157
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,280
very frivolous

158
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,340
Then I chose this piece because of this

159
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,420
biology he is gradually changing

160
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,240
that he

161
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,080
by some of the past

162
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,160
Probably some observations and some more qualitative

163
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,440
east and west

164
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,240
Record what this thing is when you see it

165
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,300
Work like that gradually

166
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,160
Doing some rather quantitative reason is quite quantitative

167
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,960
need to make some inferences

168
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,760
this kind of work

169
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,880
That's what makes this a lot of mathematicians including statistics

170
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,980
Mathematicians, including scientists, have a lot of room for this activity

171
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,600
Then we can use some of our thinking abilities

172
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,120
come to help

173
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,440
this from this

174
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,720
huge amount of this

175
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,300
Find some rules in financial data

176
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,160
The human genome is

177
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
This financial project

178
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,920
It was roughly completed around the beginning of 2000 AD

179
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,160
The main thing is to do some regular work

180
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
that in that respect

181
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,500
At the beginning, everyone thought there were about 30,000 gold

182
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,960
But now it turns out that there aren't that many

183
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,500
More than 30,000 gold is mainly based on some knowledge at that time

184
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,660
Estimated from some computers

185
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,500
Then this slide was produced by the US Department of Energy

186
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Originally promoted this project

187
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:41,160
Then the remaining problems after decoding begin

188
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,300
Because there are twenty-five thousand gold

189
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,000
What is the function of each gold?

190
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,820
Then is it in the genome world

191
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,500
Different genes can form a functional body

192
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,200
between the different functions

193
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,700
What is its interactive relationship like?

194
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,900
Then there are two-year-old cells

195
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,300
How do you use these genes to regulate his metabolism?

196
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,200
issues of growth

197
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,200
Then there are many problems

198
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,800
a bunch of these

199
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,300
Iton, I can’t talk to each and every one of you

200
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,800
introduce

201
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:17,900
That

202
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,700
So from

203
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,600
In basic biology, there is probably an idea that it is hoped that the

204
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,500
use these genes

205
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,600
This information about genes

206
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,100
Then form a science

207
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,600
then research this

208
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,700
The various components in this cell

209
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,000
Then

210
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,400
To describe which gene has how much?

211
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,600
then when does he show it

212
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,300
What is the result of his performance and his influence?

213
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,900
Wait, make a big, big mathematical model

214
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,900
Then right on the computer you might be able to

215
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,600
Even make a so-called Virtual Cell

216
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,800
just one by one

217
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,300
imaginary this

218
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,100
cell but

219
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
The function inside is just like the performance inside

220
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,200
It is exactly the same as normal real cells

221
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,000
So it's a fairly

222
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,560
It's a pretty great one

223
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,000
enough for me to be there

224
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,600
Hope to be able to do some cells

225
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,400
How do you respond to external stimuli?

226
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:29,600
But before accomplishing such a great task

227
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,920
This Medical Research

228
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,360
In fact, it is more advanced

229
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,040
they can't wait

230
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,760
Because if you want to do this basic scientific research

231
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,840
Nothing to do with practicality

232
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,840
In fact, there is no support from any government

233
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,440
Because it is a complex disease with many direct

234
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,080
Everyone thinks it has something to do with genes

235
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,000
what is the relationship

236
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,560
how to use these

237
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,160
Although the knowledge of this gene body of the incisor just now

238
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,760
is able to do some help

239
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,160
just inside

240
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,960
I will list one here

241
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,840
Currently doing the easiest to identify

242
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,840
a doable goal

243
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,600
so-called molecular diagnosis

244
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,440
is the traditional words

245
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,400
according to the pathologist

246
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,400
this slice and so on

247
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,560
make some judgments

248
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,840
Judgments like that are often wrong

249
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,160
Method doesn't get enough queries

250
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,840
So now based on some molecular

251
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,280
The method is through some genetic

252
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,480
performance measurement

253
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,280
See if there are any mutations in the gene, etc.

254
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,480
do some diagnostics

255
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,280
Then

256
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,880
So his goal is to hope that this

257
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,360
Physicians can use this

258
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,080
Before diseased tissue stroke

259
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,680
can predict

260
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,480
express like cancer cells are

261
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,280
it might happen etc.

262
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,880
and then further able to

263
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,040
The medical quality of treatment has

264
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,680
substantial improvement

265
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,440
and then even

266
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,400
Someone mentioned whether your genes are bad

267
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,000
I can help you remodel and so on.

268
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,600
Then when we talked about how to do this analysis

269
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,800
Such complex information on this gene was previously

270
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,200
We must have some of the most basic of this

271
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,400
Ballage Background

272
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,800
So I'll post it in a few minutes

273
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Soon Goal through these so-called Knowledge

274
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,700
So if this is the case

275
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,700
We have some consensus in the talk below

276
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,700
Then one of the most basic biological

277
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,200
a so-called law

278
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,400
A dogma is its message

279
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,100
It's inside the organism called the cell

280
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,500
Its communication The communication of this instruction is from

281
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,000
this DNA

282
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,200
Then inside this chromosome

283
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,200
Then this DNA

284
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,000
Chrysostom

285
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Then after this transcription is transferred to

286
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
into this messenger RNA

287
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
messenger RNA

288
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Then translate into this protein after translation

289
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
is our protein

290
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Some biological functions are carried out by proteins

291
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That is of course a dogma here

292
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
For everything in biology, there are examples and there must be counterexamples.

293
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So there are counterexamples

294
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So there are quite a few cases like this one

295
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
information flow will be

296
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
not complied with

297
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
that that

298
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
you open a cell

299
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Fetch something from the cell when it makes sense

300
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The most important component is the chromosome

301
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Chromosome words

302
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
We all know it is through

303
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Four different nucleotide compositions

304
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
ATG type

305
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,400
that's a pair

306
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,020
Then it's highly congruent

307
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,900
These two will

308
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,900
If it is A, it must be received by T.

309
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,020
If it is G, it must be received by C.

310
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,620
Then you don't understand people's words

311
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,000
conceivably say yes

312
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,300
A is a relatively large

313
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,600
This probably is

314
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,200
Then T is relatively small

315
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,500
so one big and one small

316
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,800
This way it matches Size

317
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,300
That G is relatively large

318
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,500
That C is relatively small

319
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,400
no symmetrical relationship

320
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Then A cannot match G

321
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
etc.

322
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,300
That gene is actually this

323
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,300
the whole this very long this

324
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,700
A short passage from ChromoSong

325
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,200
a fragment of it

326
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,900
it has a message

327
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,800
kana order

328
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,700
what is its message

329
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,920
based on these

330
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,100
Let's say your DNA is double-stranded

331
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,400
then you are single

332
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,600
For example, this stock is GCA

333
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,560
GCA will be transferred

334
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,320
translates to an amino acid

335
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,320
We have a total of 20 different amino acids

336
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,120
20 amino acids are arranged and combined through ATGC

337
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,520
translate it

338
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,720
After talking about genes

339
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,920
an important thing

340
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,320
It's this Messenger

341
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,520
ribonucleic acid

342
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,420
What is message RNA

343
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,020
It is a certain segment in this DNA

344
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,880
Especially in this part of the gene

345
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,920
near the gene

346
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,120
it will have a

347
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,840
This mechanism puts the ATGC of this section

348
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,300
make a copy of it

349
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,540
copy over

350
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,240
Then this copy will be sent outside the cell box

351
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,500
Then go through this Ribosol

352
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,000
Ribosol imagined as a large

353
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,440
processing plant a manufacturing machine

354
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,540
It can put this oil slick in the cytoplasm

355
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,940
Some amino acids hold it together piece by piece like this

356
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,540
According to your ATGC

357
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,740
It will look for those relative Amino Acid

358
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,140
snap it out like this

359
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,440
So there's nothing wrong with that

360
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,740
So this is a natural structure like this

361
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,040
That is, a certain section of your ATGC will be automatically translated

362
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,440
I just said that's right

363
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,440
In fact all living organisms

364
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,540
In fact, there are quite a lot of mistakes

365
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,440
is a lot

366
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,040
Then it will have some correction mechanism

367
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,940
The words there are also a great knowledge

368
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,200
This is a different version of what I just said.

369
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,500
This view wing map is the nucleus.

370
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,880
Then through this transfer work from the gene

371
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,920
Why do cells need to do the job of transferring

372
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,800
At first I thought it was strong

373
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,760
Because you are inside the Cromosome of the Code of DNA

374
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,300
If you use this Ribos every time

375
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,260
What you want to transfer is directly from this gene

376
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,700
If the code comes out directly

377
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,460
The original one is often used

378
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,700
So he can be easily damaged

379
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,700
It doesn't matter if you destroy this Messenger IM

380
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,500
because you regenerated

381
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,900
You can also copy one more

382
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,500
So this is a pretty clever design

383
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,160
At the same time, in higher organisms

384
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,260
it has a nucleus

385
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,060
Then the outer words are the cytoplasm

386
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,620
So these Messenger IMs will be sent out

387
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,060
so inside it won't

388
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
There will be a state of traffic chaos

389
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,080
So we just talked about this protein

390
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,040
Protein is made up of 20 Armino-S

391
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,480
A series of Armino-S for sightseeing

392
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,240
Actually it doesn't work by itself

393
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,920
it relies on some of its

394
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,320
interaction near each other

395
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,820
Form a so-called Protin Fold

396
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,720
it has to be folded into a shape

397
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,680
this shape it is

398
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,260
The most important protin is relying on its shape

399
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,340
Is there a hole in it or something?

400
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,840
To determine its nature

401
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,480
words like this are

402
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,960
This is to show

403
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,720
A synthetic beauty called ATD inside the force line body

404
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,820
ATD is what we call Hot Cache of Energy

405
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,580
thermal diving

406
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,440
if you want to generate fuel

407
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,440
You must go through ATD

408
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,120
This one in the vertical line is a synthesis of ATV

409
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,220
In this two different this

410
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,360
There is an EcoLine in the bio, which is what the large intestine looks like inside

411
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,660
the words on the left

412
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,280
I didn't write this here like a monkey or an orangutan

413
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,880
They look the same, but they are actually very similar, although the level of this creature is much different.

414
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,720
But it's fairly consistent on the most basic units

415
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,380
At the same time, it can be seen that the ProtinBis attachment I just mentioned

416
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,940
very church made form

417
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,260
attached to a different this shape

418
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,080
It's like a jigsaw puzzle, especially so this

419
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,160
this is a very interesting question

420
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,860
OK

421
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,960
The other more interesting question is that we have the same memory

422
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:17,040
We know that after the combination of the heavy bag and the gold side of the egg

423
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,040
This one cell begins to divide

424
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,040
Those cells will grow into different tissues

425
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,040
The DNA in every tissue is actually the same

426
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,080
then you will wonder why

427
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,080
The shape of the nose is different from the glasses

428
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,080
The cells in there are exactly the same

429
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,080
That is how the matter

430
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,080
The mechanism is in the expression of this gene

431
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,080
Because you will form a different organization

432
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,080
And the results of many different protins will be different

433
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,080
Those protins are expressed by the wear debris gene

434
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,080
that's in a different organization

435
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,120
The expression of various genes will be relatively different

436
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,120
so in this

437
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,060
Slowly distribute from this embryo

438
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,520
it's a lot of fun

439
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,820
Which genes are expressed and when

440
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,060
Anyway, those things are formed first

441
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,660
what is formed after

442
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,000
That's a whole lot of knowledge

443
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,200
Biologists rely on data

444
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,560
Such a large data transfer

445
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,600
Slowly and slowly make this thing out again

446
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I just talked about how cells receive external stimuli

447
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and then some reactions will come out

448
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
let it grow etc.

449
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
this is a wanton

450
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It is to receive some stimuli from the outside in the biological cells

451
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
usually on the outermost part of the cell

452
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
There are some proteins called receptor protein

453
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
lean body

454
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,020
will accept small molecules

455
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,020
put this together

456
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,520
Then it will have some chemical management

457
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,260
wait

458
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,260
and then at the end its ultimate goal

459
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,760
is it possible to send this message to

460
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
inside the nucleus

461
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,260
Then there will be some of this protein

462
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,460
These proteins are called transcription factors

463
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,700
The protein will bind to the DNA

464
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,000
Then bring a certain segment of the gene

465
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,020
This section of the gene it will

466
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,020
copied by this into this

467
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,360
message says this

468
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,860
Then through the message, there will be protein

469
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,860
then there will be some

470
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,060
The role of protein

471
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,260
those effects

472
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,560
It can also drive and possibly interact with other protein

473
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,560
driving combination etc.

474
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,320
So accept this signal from the outside

475
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,820
There are a lot of proteins, there are a lot of receptors

476
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,820
So you can accept different signal

477
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,240
so which protein

478
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
Can

479
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,240
What kind of signal does this accept

480
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,640
Then what happens underneath

481
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,440
This whole thing is called signal transduction

482
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,320
chain of information transfer

483
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,440
This is something that biologists really want to know

484
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,280
That also relies on the so-called bi-information

485
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,160
is what bioinformaticians are currently doing

486
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:37,760
Let’s go back to what we just said that the entire length of Keelung has about three B-faces.

487
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,480
30 3 billion Nuclear type base failure

488
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,760
So there is a lot of information in the words

489
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,120
Now we know that there are about 25,000 genes

490
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,000
Then it occupies only a small part of Keelung

491
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
But there is a so-called intro in this gene

492
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
There is so-called excel

493
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,720
intron is the useful part

494
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,520
intron is the useless part

495
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,120
extron is the useful part

496
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,600
Then there are some permutations and combinations of these

497
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,840
Then what is the outside of this gincoding doing?

498
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,160
I used to think it was junk

499
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,880
But now it is very important

500
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,760
Because there are some transcription factors

501
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,000
to bind in front

502
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,640
Then if it says that it was stimulated by some fakes, etc.

503
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,000
then it won't work

504
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,520
So there is a lot of research on that area.

505
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,160
So this transfer medicine

506
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,000
It is hoped that through these genes

507
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,200
able to promote these

508
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,800
Immediately be able to do something that can be done immediately

509
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,200
the most important job

510
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,600
Of course, is it the information

511
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,800
can be used to help patients survive

512
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
survival of life

513
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
Of course there is some information

514
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,800
Of course there is some information

515
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
Of course there is some information

516
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,600
used to help patients survive

517
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
survival of life

518
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,280
of course live

519
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,360
So the first question is to say

520
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,440
Are you able to rely on the information

521
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,200
can be used to predict

522
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,000
don't talk yet

523
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,340
First predict to see how long he can survive the patient

524
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,120
According to your comprehension

525
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,620
no choice

526
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,900
From these materials

527
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,680
can be compared to the traditional for example

528
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,460
Staging

529
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,500
you heard this

530
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,800
stage of lung cancer

531
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,340
What is the approximate survival rate?

532
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,360
Is it better than those

533
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,160
there is this pathologist

534
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,120
according to their tissue lesions

535
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,000
See if he transfers and so on

536
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,020
able to be more precise

537
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,560
this is the first goal

538
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,100
And what about the second goal?

539
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,880
can you can

540
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,680
according to your this

541
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,980
Elite performance status

542
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,060
see if i use this drug

543
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,340
how will he react

544
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,100
He can

545
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,120
more effective

546
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,160
or less effective

547
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,220
even

548
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,300
I hope to do some two-case detection

549
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,080
before the disease occurs

550
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,560
let's see if

551
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,280
start soon

552
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,320
Then try to do prevention

553
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,340
finally

554
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,680
Of course, you can hope to improve your quality of life

555
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,960
quality of your life

556
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,440
Then we use the so-called this

557
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,760
What exactly is this resource?

558
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,320
what can be used is

559
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,600
this

560
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,940
Biochemists have many techniques

561
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,320
Now this biotechnology can see a lot of data

562
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,880
probably which data

563
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,680
my side

564
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,720
just slightly

565
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,920
describe

566
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,960
there is

567
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,720
micro array is

568
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,000
micro certificate list

569
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,040
micro certificate list

570
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,840
genetic information

571
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,380
Then there is another

572
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,440
called

573
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,240
array CGS

574
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,960
array CGS is fetched

575
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,800
Probe says it's this

576
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,360
DNA的 copy

577
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,640
it is known

578
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,920
that usually

579
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
A Sale has two chromosons, that is, a pair

580
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
If you card DNA, you have Kirby

581
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
but in some cases

582
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
no change etc.

583
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
It will be more than Number for this card

584
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
For a certain paragraph it is

585
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
The reason for how to continue has been repeated many times

586
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
repeat a lot

587
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Then you will affect the expression of the last gene

588
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It's just that certain genes are overexpressed

589
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Sometimes those Kabi Numbers suddenly decrease a bit

590
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
That's the part that doesn't work

591
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
or for no reason

592
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
when passing from one generation to the next

593
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
lost

594
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Then there is Single Nucretypulomorphism

595
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
This is a genetic variant

596
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
This piece is also quite a lot of information

597
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Then there is something called Transcription Factor

598
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Information about Binding Side

599
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
is what we just mentioned

600
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
A Transcription Factor

601
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Can Binding in this

602
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,280
Where is this DNA

603
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,600
什麼transcription factor by the way

604
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,920
this is a great knowledge

605
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,220
There are some techniques that can be used

606
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,520
There is also one called micro-init

607
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,080
This is a violation of the peace talks

608
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,120
those performance

609
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,160
Very important

610
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,680
That

611
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,220
this is currently

612
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,580
The so-called very, very popular one that everyone talks about is very expensive.

613
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,340
that is

614
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,640
This sequence in the new century

615
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,200
He took this test

616
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:34,800
a whole genome of this

617
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,840
DNA

618
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,120
each nuclear

619
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,160
can order it out

620
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:43,000
In the past, this was an impossible, almost impossible task.

621
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,020
Too much

622
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,040
but now

623
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:45,820
you actually

624
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,140
can be in about a week or two

625
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,200
you can put your gene

626
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,240
genetic

627
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,060
All the nuclear all take you

628
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,340
order out

629
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,080
This progress is very open

630
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,600
but still quite expensive

631
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,400
Then my most important thing today is

632
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,600
focus on this

633
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,000
micro rate of this technique

634
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,200
that many other this

635
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,600
Race, CHF, SNP

636
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,700
His basic spirit is the same as this

637
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,100
that next generation

638
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,300
He made it completely different

639
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,400
technique

640
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,300
But we use some statistical methods

641
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,800
can pass

642
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,700
use that

643
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,600
micro

644
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,500
This is a micro certificate column

645
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,900
This chip is certified

646
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,800
it looks like this

647
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,700
every place words

648
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,000
there is a spot of light

649
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,200
The brightness of this spot

650
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,000
represent this place

651
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,200
it's early

652
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:49,800
this

653
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,300
This Messenger ion is bright

654
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,600
every imaginable

655
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,500
Every place is a carbon needle

656
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,600
ours

657
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,100
can put

658
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,560
All genes are one by one

659
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,840
straight up here

660
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,640
because we already know its sequence

661
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,440
Then

662
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,740
that according to its this

663
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,360
on the DNA

664
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,540
complementary binding

665
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,080
is A to G

666
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,600
G to C

667
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,100
so

668
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,400
it can find its relative

669
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,680
stick it on

670
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,760
So the whole technology is already very mature.

671
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,780
so

672
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,680
This microRNA can

673
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,280
because it's pretty much telling you how much the gene is expressed

674
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,560
How much is this gene expressed

675
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,620
so it can be used for many things

676
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,400
mark this creature

677
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,680
do this

678
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,960
with this

679
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,800
With this biomarker some drugs can be developed

680
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,900
We can use the expression of these genes to divide cancer

681
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,460
So it's very, very useful

682
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:59,140
Then this is just one of the earliest applications

683
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:08,600
The Elegant group of the Broad Institute in the United States made such a result very early

684
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:20,600
There are two different types of Leukemia related to leukemia

685
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,600
in terms of gene expression

686
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,200
We find the set of genes

687
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:37,200
Leukemia performance is relatively high

688
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:44,200
In AML, it is the snow white disease of acute femoral water disease

689
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,700
low performance

690
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,200
Another set of genes is just the opposite

691
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Since you can find genes like this

692
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,200
So in the future you have to use it to judge that it is the ideal of this person.

693
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,700
What type of this Rukimia got

694
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:08,100
by measuring the expression of these genes

695
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,100
make a judgment

696
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,900
Then let me briefly introduce

697
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,900
This is mine just now

698
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,200
Director Liu Fuye also mentioned this National Taiwan University

699
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:33,200
That Professor Yang Panzi is currently the dean of this medical school

700
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,600
What their research team is doing

701
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,500
that their most important

702
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,800
is doing lung cancer research

703
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,900
What about lung cancer?

704
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,800
in taiwan can

705
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,200
There are two types of lung cancer

706
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,500
is a small cell

707
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,900
one is non-small cell

708
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,600
Anyway, of course there are other kinds

709
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,100
The current research

710
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,760
So the hot part is no longer small cells

711
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,800
Because non-small cells are more

712
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,960
nephrocytes

713
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,360
Non-small cells can be further divided into two categories

714
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,600
One is an Arduino Castle

715
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,000
adenocarcinoma of the lung

716
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,400
Then the other is to ask for Squamous Cell Cancer

717
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,200
on-going cells

718
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,240
This pathology looks

719
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,080
This slice looks quite different

720
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,320
The length is also different

721
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,520
Then this Arduino Castle

722
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,920
The reason why there are so many researches

723
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,920
most importantly

724
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:44,320
This epidemiology found that it is this

725
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,520
female non-smoking

726
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,920
especially easy to get this kind of

727
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,920
That is to say, women do not smoke

728
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,120
So if the doctor tells you that you have lung cancer

729
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,240
The skin is definitely the fat gland

730
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,740
Very few people will get the cells of this Scramers

731
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,240
It is generally believed that smoking causes cancer

732
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,440
that doesn't smoke

733
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,960
why cancer

734
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,040
It's still a pretty big puzzle

735
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,840
that don't smoke especially women

736
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:31,220
got a specific type of cancer

737
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:38,380
Then his research

738
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,500
In medicine, that is now very popular.

739
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,060
Especially when he discovered a drug

740
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:50,160
is to do this with a mutation to EGF

741
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,240
A mutation in a gene called EGF

742
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,540
is a production technology

743
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,840
lower level

744
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,040
EpDemo

745
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,380
Ghost Factor

746
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
what is it called shrimp skin

747
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,000
Shrimp tissue this

748
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,600
to grow

749
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,400
factor

750
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,800
that kind of thing

751
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,900
Mostly in the outbound cell growth

752
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,800
It is used a lot in fermented products

753
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,900
over there

754
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,300
a certain one

755
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,800
Nucre-Tide

756
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,500
have a mutation

757
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,100
or was deleted

758
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,300
You have a drug with that mutation

759
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,600
Very effective to keep your cancer under control

760
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,000
so

761
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,600
the whole

762
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:35,700
this

763
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,100
above number 1

764
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,300
or treatment

765
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,000
a very important discovery

766
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,500
That

767
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,500
Teach them the whole of this

768
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,000
Most of this treatment of lung cancer

769
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,600
hope to do is

770
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,400
be able to do this gine screaming first

771
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,700
For example, I just mentioned that it is you if the gine

772
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,000
There are some legal

773
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Then you can put the screen out

774
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Then there is a cure

775
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
That opinion law is not the only mutation

776
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
you may have other different mutations

777
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Is that the opinionality of being able to discover other genes

778
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Those structures that have mutations or mutations that are different from normal

779
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Can be taken out as a target of your drag

780
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Make something to target it with medicine

781
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Then this is currently hoping to find some drag targets

782
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
so what

783
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
This you can do some early detection

784
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
capable of some dalgonosis

785
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Then mentioned many times here are all biomarkers

786
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Biomarker is required for screen early detection

787
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
The biomarker

788
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
What about the biomarker we used?

789
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,140
There are so many, you can have pictures, and then you can also use the expression of this gene, microRNA

790
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,480
What about Teacher Yang's team, this

791
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:16,380
OK, that is BioMarket and so on, this has just been mentioned

792
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,020
Teacher Yang and their greatest contribution is on this day

793
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:28,420
The article is on New English Medicine, the first author is Chen Xuanyi

794
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:35,580
Currently serving in our unit, this is his work when he was a doctoral student at National Taiwan University

795
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,220
They found five genes, the five genes

796
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:48,120
What about the performance of your five genes, here

797
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,740
This picture shows 13 genes, about 16 genes.

798
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:57,600
Finally, they found out from these sixteen genes, and finally found out five genes

799
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,120
Then according to the sixteen genes

800
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,840
In terms of genes, you can see that the expression chain is relatively high

801
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,160
The higher performance chain is yellow

802
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,760
Some genes have a higher expression chain

803
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,700
Making other genes high is a very good performance

804
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,500
Then according to these heights?

805
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,600
It can do a math with the above formula

806
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,460
compress it to

807
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:21,100
Then make a this to predict this

808
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:25,260
It's an indicator of the patient's survival

809
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,760
The higher the number of months, the higher your risk

810
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,220
Then they can prove from this clinical data that

811
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,620
What about the marker they got?

812
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:41,320
is very effective in distinguishing between the relatively low risk

813
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,720
higher risk

814
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,960
What about this picture?

815
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,820
In fact, statistical biometrics

816
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,360
One of the most famous pictures

817
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,360
It's called the shipping chart

818
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,020
This picture of that CAP-CAP-MILLE

819
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,420
Then it reads as

820
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,160
All your patients start out alive

821
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,160
then learn

822
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,680
In the course of time people start dying

823
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,400
If one is not dead, he will drop one.

824
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,100
How much does it cost? This is learning to have one of this

825
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,680
There is a formula above the statistics

826
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,440
so fall faster

827
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,840
If you click more, it means your this

828
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,280
is a risk

829
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,780
the greater the risk

830
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,300
So your low risk can hardly drop

831
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,980
high risk falls quickly

832
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:32,860
Then Teacher Yang and their results

833
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,660
then come in this

834
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,260
data in the west

835
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,820
this nature

836
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:40,660
There is a genetic medicine

837
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,660
2008 people this shedon

838
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,460
They also mentioned in their works

839
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,660
And then it turns out he's still just as effective

840
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,100
so no matter in

841
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,740
Eastern sources in Western sources

842
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:56,060
It can also be used to do this

843
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,660
This none small sale cancer

844
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,960
this lone cancer

845
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,240
BioMarket can be used to predict the survival of his patients

846
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,780
by the way SheddonLead author

847
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:13,580
This is American is my former student at UCL

848
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,380
Is it actually the author's side when he does it with me?

849
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,960
he's just a statistician

850
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,660
He's in Michigan now

851
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:26,320
He can actually be the first science in Natural Medicine

852
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,820
This article is very good

853
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:36,380
He is combining about four or five large American institutions to build the Long Cancer Center.

854
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,980
the collected data

855
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:41,320
bring it all together

856
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:50,460
To see which way to predict patient survival

857
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,760
which one is better

858
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,500
Because stuff like suspense they do is just one way

859
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,180
There are others who have different information and find out different methods

860
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Their article is to use different marks for direct comparison

861
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Another job is to do what's called microsugar

862
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Micro ribonucleic acid is micro-init

863
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
micro-init is a little bit bigger than normal Messingale

864
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It only has about 22 nucleotides

865
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
With so compact micro-init

866
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Generally speaking, it is believed that it can be attached to some Messingale

867
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
The above init can destroy it or make it non-transferable

868
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So it has a regulatory effect on this gene

869
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So while making a lot of Messingale like this

870
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
In principle, it is to be translated into Protin

871
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Bringing out INA is equivalent to killing you or destroying your entire project.

872
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,240
make you a whole can

873
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,320
So this MICRO-INA is very important

874
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,800
Although it is a small tax

875
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,320
Tax is small, people are small, ghosts are big

876
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,320
According to this article

877
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,680
This is our team with that

878
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,680
Yang Panzi's team worked on this Consol Cell

879
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,720
Just find these five MICRO-INA

880
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,520
and then do the same

881
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,680
Find a RISC score

882
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,080
This RISC score is also based on Cox Regression here

883
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,560
is a method of biostatistical analysis

884
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,040
go find it this

885
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,840
The degree of influence on the survival of this certainty

886
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,880
and then give it a different weight

887
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,480
different weight

888
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,080
Then find out a RISC score like this

889
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,480
Then you look at the place where the RISC score is higher

890
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,440
This side is this time of survival

891
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,660
The same color means dead, most of the dead are more

892
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,340
At the same time, the living time is relatively small

893
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,340
A little less, life is higher here

894
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,220
If the soil is like this, in fact

895
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,340
Without some statistical analysis

896
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,740
Originally speaking, it was very messy at all.

897
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:20,140
Then here is according to this certain order

898
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,240
It must be added so that you can see it

899
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,340
This looks very orderly

900
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:33,340
Then of course you can also put a different marker

901
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,480
put it together

902
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,980
For example you can put this

903
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,660
Use gene expression and this micro as a combination

904
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,060
can get this shipped

905
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:45,540
This prediction can do better

906
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,340
OK, so to put it simply

907
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,840
through life support data

908
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:59,040
The future theme is mainly hope from the patient

909
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,440
draw blood, etc.

910
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,960
then go through this

911
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,520
microarray

912
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,040
You just put the number of this gene

913
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,000
order out

914
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,280
Then do some math analysis

915
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,040
then you can bring

916
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,200
look at yours

917
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,160
how is the current situation

918
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,280
It probably depends on how advanced the disease is, etc.

919
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,280
or

920
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
OK

921
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
good

922
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Then the many effects we just mentioned

923
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
then i want that now

924
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
make a

925
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
a little summary

926
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Then I hope that today I can give you

927
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
There is a relatively healthy

928
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
because I just kept saying

929
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
we can do this

930
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
that some and every time you mention these things say

931
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,360
There can be statistical methods and so on, and at the end it will be your result

932
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,000
like that i think

933
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,400
There is no deep-rooted effect, but if I say that I want to

934
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,200
All in all, there are too many companies, so

935
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,960
I decided to just tell you guys

936
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,760
Some very important concepts. What about this concept?

937
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,920
Can be used on this gene to behave like that

938
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,560
At the same time, you can also take it home and use it in your other

939
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:41,360
life or you deal with other data above

940
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:46,560
Then I hope to be able to do something like this

941
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,720
good

942
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,760
Let's start from here

943
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:59,760
Science is usually advanced and depends on some

944
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,760
info

945
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
inferences, make some inferences

946
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
These inferences are usually drawn from some already known

947
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
or partially known, to speculate on those who do not know

948
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
or partially know

949
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,000
that in this statistician

950
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
that they often use a method

951
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
is to use some so-called this

952
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
random, Marko-random model to

953
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
is that you put each variable

954
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
each variable as a

955
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Treat it as a node like this

956
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
With this, A is a variable

957
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
B is a variable

958
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
This R is a parameter etc.

959
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Then this variable can control the variables below, etc.

960
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Well, the statistics are more interesting

961
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
that's what they do

962
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
a corollary that can do something like this

963
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
That is, if I talk about the variable A

964
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,600
I can get some data

965
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,600
For the variable C, some data can also be obtained

966
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,100
E is also available

967
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,600
D is also available

968
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,400
But I don't know R and V

969
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,100
these are my interesting

970
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,400
Through some so-called Bation of computation

971
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,800
This calculation method of Base

972
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,800
If you already know this before and after

973
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,400
relationship words

974
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,800
it can go backwards

975
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,400
You can get what is the variable in this R

976
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,100
That

977
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,700
But a structure like this

978
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,600
pro set is

979
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,500
First

980
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:42,100
There are quite a lot of these nodes in the biological system

981
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,200
That

982
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:43,900
at the same time

983
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,000
You know a lot

984
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,800
Let's say you now have 25,000 genes

985
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,500
You now have 25,000 nodes all know

986
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,800
but there are many things in it

987
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,900
don't even know

988
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,900
There will be more things I don't know

989
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,800
So there are many of this dimension

990
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
some problems

991
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,000
how to overcome this

992
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Dimension Difficulty

993
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
On Base Computation

994
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
great progress so far

995
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Statisticians invest a lot

996
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Many so-called MCMC Algorithms

997
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
what about that part

998
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I won't talk about him here

999
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
That's what I just mentioned about Macopher's

1000
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
this principle

1001
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So what I want to talk about today is

1002
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
This is the comparison

1003
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
as a more general

1004
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
just don't need to say yes so carefully

1005
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I have to know this identification

1006
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Which one to identify

1007
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
what kind of relationship

1008
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
This is comparing a Generic Purpose

1009
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
This is the relationship between identification and identification

1010
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I do not know anything

1011
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I don't need to make any assumptions

1012
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
then you can fetch

1013
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Do this to maintain the drop-down above

1014
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It's just that I have a lot of information

1015
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
But according to these common methods

1016
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
we can reduce it to its dimension

1017
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Comparably capable of mastering these data

1018
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Then there are several ways

1019
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
One is Principle Component composition analysis

1020
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Factor Analysis

1021
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And then there's the division of powers and so on.

1022
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Behind these methods

1023
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
In fact, the most important concept is

1024
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Correlation

1025
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
That's because there are many variables

1026
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
So different Correlation is a lot

1027
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Then it looks like a matrix

1028
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
It is Correlation Matrix

1029
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Then this Correlation

1030
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
You can also look at it from another angle

1031
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It can also be regarded as similarity

1032
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Large and polyphasic

1033
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
High Correlation indicates that the two verbals are very similar

1034
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
wait

1035
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
ok so let's get back to this

1036
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,400
Expression of this gene in Micro-A

1037
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,500
you see these bright spots

1038
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,640
first step

1039
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,400
you need to analyze the data

1040
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,400
You're going to do a lighten on this intensity

1041
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,400
The lighting is very simple

1042
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,800
That's what it's called how bright it is

1043
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,000
But the measurement of brightness is not enough

1044
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,800
In fact, if you put this image

1045
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,000
transfer is the expression of the gene

1046
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:29,400
There are a lot of statistical

1047
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,560
Application service

1048
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,500
how it goes

1049
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,000
Because every different color has some bias

1050
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,500
There are also cases where this wavelength is different

1051
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,200
it will have some of this deviation

1052
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,100
it is to correct

1053
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,200
Then different just above this space

1054
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,400
Different points may have some deviation

1055
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,500
These things have to be corrected

1056
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,800
Then some background noise

1057
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:57,000
Then so this part belongs to the part of this image processing

1058
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,200
then more trouble

1059
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,000
this paragraph

1060
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,160
after processing

1061
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,680
Usually all you have to do is

1062
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,440
Action of Chip and Chip's Nong Ma Lai

1063
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,200
I am now in today's laboratory

1064
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,640
make a plane

1065
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,000
After the next five minutes, another piece of machine noodles was created

1066
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,880
But it is in this film and the film

1067
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,400
There is a different treatment of this

1068
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,320
not saying different

1069
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,440
the same way

1070
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,760
But the operation is always different

1071
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,280
Then the words inside

1072
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,080
There may be many, many factors

1073
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,840
For example, sometimes your machine capacity is slightly different

1074
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,040
poor temperature control

1075
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,360
Or in this Processor

1076
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,480
you have to go through cleaning and so on

1077
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,560
It is quite complicated Processor

1078
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,000
Any step can go wrong

1079
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
From then on we often see

1080
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,240
This one looks very bright

1081
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,400
That one looks less bright

1082
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,720
what about these

1083
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,000
These require statistical methods

1084
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,760
to do Normalization

1085
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,200
Now here comes the problem

1086
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,520
everyone can do

1087
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,000
because

1088
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,560
There are too many statisticians

1089
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,600
In fact there are different teams

1090
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,420
Each team's words are also quite famous

1091
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:10,240
For example, my former colleague is now

1092
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:14,080
Academician Wang Yongxiong

1093
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,380
Now at Stanford

1094
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,720
They have a method called D-CHIP that must be used a lot

1095
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,760
The other word is

1096
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,320
Terry Speed's One

1097
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,600
that

1098
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,900
Berger Professor of Statistics

1099
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:30,720
He has a very popular method

1100
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,500
what about different methods

1101
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,300
Everyone uses a lot but

1102
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,120
The trouble is this result

1103
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,160
the result is different

1104
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:40,700
Message out

1105
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,980
tend to create

1106
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,560
different and that difference is quite a difference

1107
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,100
so what about this

1108
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,900
there is no way

1109
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:52,220
The only suggestion is

1110
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,320
You may need to use a little more method and find out his commonality

1111
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,080
Then

1112
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,100
hope at a different time

1113
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,560
According to this experiment in the next step

1114
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,120
to determine which one would be better

1115
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:09,480
The other concept I want to tell you is that

1116
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,520
Relative amount

1117
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:15,880
We hope that in fact we want to say how many votes a certain gene has

1118
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,160
but this kind of thing

1119
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,200
he is so far unfeasible

1120
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,000
there is no way to do it like this

1121
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:23,040
Now the only thing that can be done is

1122
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,900
The relative amount is the relative amount of this gene to that one.

1123
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:28,680
this thing

1124
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,980
can be detected

1125
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:40,200
What about after this preprocessing?

1126
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:43,780
What we got is this kind of out-of-string data is

1127
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,620
Here each row represents a gene

1128
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:53,000
This is the gene. The first gene, the second gene, and the third gene are those light spots.

1129
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:53,760
Then

1130
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,560
listed like this

1131
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:56,840
First

1132
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,920
The first column is in this

1133
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,380
The first piece, you need to make a

1134
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,960
The experiment obtained by the operation is this kind

1135
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,080
You found a situation and got

1136
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,940
It is a chip that represents a

1137
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,440
a condition

1138
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,600
is the condition

1139
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,120
I use this below

1140
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:26,000
This cycle of filial mother bacteria to explain

1141
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,600
This filial mother fungus in its lifetime

1142
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,600
he only does one thing

1143
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,600
that is

1144
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,600
In copying one cell divides into two cells

1145
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,600
But this process is quite complicated

1146
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,600
Filial piety mothers want to know

1147
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,600
at a certain stage

1148
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,600
Which genes are expressed

1149
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,600
Why can it be done from one place

1150
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,600
which one next step

1151
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,600
So there is something like this

1152
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,600
gene expression data

1153
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,600
According to the data of such performance

1154
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,600
would have been very complicated

1155
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,600
But after the so-called

1156
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,000
So Cruster's method is to group genes with the same or similar expression

1157
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Then you will see that if it is a certain piece of A, it becomes very similar

1158
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
And then this say this is the original part

1159
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Then you take the same piece of a certain piece and enlarge it

1160
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
You can see it and see what its gene is doing

1161
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
For example, most of this area is rival zone

1162
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
It is the body of the translation of the gene that we just talked about

1163
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,000
These things make the biologist happy

1164
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:41,000
He said that through these complex things that seem to have no clue

1165
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
After you line up like this

1166
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Then it can be seen that the function of its gene is roughly the same

1167
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
So how does this work?

1168
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
In case there are some genes in this piece

1169
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It also has a different notation

1170
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,240
I don't know, that is to say, he doesn't know his function yet.

1171
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:06,100
that is placed by this in the same

1172
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,000
you can go and see

1173
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Then his function is probably the same as others already known

1174
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,400
So this is the most basic one, an application

1175
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,800
What about this grouping method?

1176
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,640
most important idea

1177
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,540
that's the similarity

1178
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:27,440
How is the similarity obtained?

1179
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,540
Statistically above

1180
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,880
is to use the so-called correlation coefficient

1181
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:34,580
The correlation coefficient is used a lot in daily life

1182
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:35,600
like you

1183
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,700
height and weight

1184
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,640
We all know that there is a proportional relationship

1185
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,300
taller, heavier

1186
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:45,200
that's roughly the way it is

1187
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,340
what about sometimes

1188
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:50,580
This correlation will become the inverse relationship

1189
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,180
Let's say your test scores

1190
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:54,080
Questions that you answered incorrectly

1191
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,880
The more mistakes you make, the lower your score

1192
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,120
In other cases, less obvious

1193
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
For example, age and speed

1194
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,600
Age and speed are roughly the same as running five strings

1195
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,900
when you were very young

1196
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,100
Probably the older you are, the faster you run

1197
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,400
but when you grow old

1198
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,800
The older you get, you can't run

1199
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,600
So the relationship is different

1200
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:18,400
Then the correlation coefficient is obtained according to a formula like this

1201
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,400
Then let me dance a little here to talk about some ceremonies

1202
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
What about the correlation coefficient?

1203
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It is rarely used by mathematicians, high teachers, etc.

1204
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,600
But on the statistical series

1205
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:37,400
Everyone admires this guy named Gelton

1206
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:43,200
He did a lot of interesting research during this period

1207
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,200
Then he published an article

1208
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:49,400
His article is typical low heredity

1209
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,700
Mate has a lot to do with biology

1210
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:56,900
Then later KL Pearson promoted his method

1211
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,700
The usual correlation we are talking about now is

1212
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
It turned out to be Gelton

1213
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Scientists at Gelton's time knew pretty much everything.

1214
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Another explorer and Georgia, Mentor, etc.

1215
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
He's a Half-Carson from Darwin

1216
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,000
so he's very interesting about the agenda

1217
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:31,000
One of the most important jobs he did was regulatory analysis

1218
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:38,000
He used the relationship between the elevation of the previous generation and the next generation

1219
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
He downloaded it one by one based on the information at the time

1220
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Then it is very hard to draw this picture

1221
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,000
This diagram is the most successful part of empirical science

1222
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,000
He just depends on how much the rise, the rise of the father, and the rise of the children

1223
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
appear, several times in this position

1224
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,300
Such a frequency graph to deduce that

1225
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:03,600
This Distribution

1226
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,840
It is a flower circle with the same probability of equal height

1227
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,200
Everyone is round

1228
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,740
are all circles in the same direction

1229
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:14,840
According to this thing, it can make some mathematical inferences

1230
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:20,340
Then add some normally distributed variables

1231
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:23,600
It can put the two-bit Normal Distribution

1232
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:23,900
come out

1233
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,800
But this is a very important formula

1234
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,720
Everyone knows that the normal distribution is that Cov is long

1235
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,800
So it looks like a Bell

1236
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,840
more in the middle

1237
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,840
relatively few aspects

1238
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:46,000
Let's take a look at a very simple application

1239
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,100
Here are four genes

1240
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:56,160
Called MCM1, MCM2, MCM3, MCM4, MCM5, MCM7

1241
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:00,020
Let's not worry about what it's doing for now

1242
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,880
Let's use the graph of its gene expression to see

1243
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,840
look at this

1244
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:07,680
mcm6 and mcm5

1245
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,480
7

1246
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,280
What about each of these two genes?

1247
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:15,360
Indicates that each point is a different condition

1248
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,900
its performance

1249
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,720
So here it means that when mcm

1250
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:21,000
when it was high

1251
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:24,060
When mcm6 is high, mcm7 is also high

1252
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,340
when d is also d

1253
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,140
So it is positively correlated

1254
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,700
So mcm7 is with

1255
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:32,700
mcm6 has a positive correlation with this one

1256
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:34,560
5 are positively related to this

1257
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,100
4 have a positive correlation

1258
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,180
3 has a positive correlation, this correlation is slightly less

1259
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,200
what about this

1260
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,240
Correlation is very weak

1261
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,520
hardly relevant

1262
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:46,340
Then take a good look at these

1263
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,620
you will find

1264
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,920
This mcm1 is very strange

1265
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:53,500
How does mcm1 relate to everyone?

1266
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:54,540
are very weak

1267
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,120
The other relationships are stronger.

1268
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,120
so what would you infer

1269
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,640
So 2 to 7, its functions on creatures should be more like

1270
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,360
Then the function of MCA1 will be relatively poor

1271
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,160
That's actually what it looks like

1272
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:22,680
The role of this MCA2 is to replicate this chromosome

1273
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,520
It helps in the replication of chromosomes

1274
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,480
This MCA1 it is a transcription factor

1275
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,560
is the transferred factor

1276
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,720
It is bind in front of this gene

1277
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,720
promoting

1278
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,880
So the two functions are completely different

1279
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:40,320
So just relying on this simple statistic

1280
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,720
You can make an inference like this

1281
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:54,320
The one I'm going to talk about next is more advanced than similarity

1282
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,040
higher level

1283
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:00,040
Then this is quite surprising

1284
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,600
What about this concept?

1285
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,160
it was me in 2002

1286
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,360
I just started jumping into this time

1287
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,500
I find

1288
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,800
At that time a lot of people have done a lot of things

1289
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,960
like this Crossing

1290
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,560
everyone did

1291
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,600
then i was thinking

1292
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,360
what am i doing here

1293
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,800
Is there anyone who already knows

1294
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,400
Everyone can use computer

1295
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,560
then i will think about some

1296
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,760
Is there still fish in the meat net?

1297
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,200
There are some ideas

1298
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,360
Everyone hasn't thought of it yet

1299
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,360
but don't be too responsible

1300
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,160
because you talk to the school of life

1301
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,560
Or what, you talked too complicated all at once

1302
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,960
they can't accept

1303
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,060
Then there will be some in the middle

1304
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:35,960
There are some gaps

1305
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,860
Then I hope to find a very simple solution

1306
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:40,660
but there's still something you can do

1307
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,660
Let everyone unexpected at the same time

1308
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:45,160
Is it possible to convince the school of life that

1309
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:45,860
also useful

1310
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:49,060
Then this article is here

1311
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:51,860
that PNS

1312
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,460
that is

1313
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:56,960
The PNS above in 2002

1314
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:59,460
post below

1315
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:00,060
then i

1316
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,340
Because just now the dean and the vice dean also mentioned that I was born in the Department of Mathematics

1317
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,660
in college

1318
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:14,500
What we often ask in mathematics is a logical relationship

1319
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,300
if a then b

1320
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,300
if a holds

1321
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:22,500
This b is established if this is a true statement

1322
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,800
Then its counter-narrative may not be correct

1323
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,200
If b is right, you may not be right about a

1324
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,900
This is a logically important concept

1325
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:33,300
So ask a question like this

1326
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:38,300
Just now we know that your two genes have a high degree of similarity

1327
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:42,400
Then we biologists focus on its biological function

1328
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,200
will be more or less the same

1329
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,000
So one question I ask is

1330
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:52,000
If two genes are related

1331
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,700
is very similar

1332
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:59,900
ok that ok

1333
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,000
you two on this creature

1334
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
it's related to genes that act a lot like

1335
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
it's this expression it's the expression

1336
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Is the degree of belief very high?

1337
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
i repeat

1338
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
What we saw earlier is

1339
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
If it is two genes, its expression is above

1340
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
its similarity is high

1341
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Biologists will accept that it functions above

1342
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
There is a fair chance it will be the same

1343
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
or similar

1344
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
What we are now asking is the opposite

1345
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
That is, two genes are related in the same way.

1346
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
participating in the same function

1347
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
It's on this gene expression

1348
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Will it be that there is often a great degree of similarity

1349
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
that answer is wrong

1350
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
It's because of our genes

1351
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
its regulation

1352
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,320
it's too complicated

1353
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,720
My first Ns is of course that micro-ray is too noisy

1354
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,000
but noise is another matter

1355
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Because of the regulation of your gene

1356
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,960
is a very complex structure

1357
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,720
So while two genes are participating in the same industry

1358
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,760
Because there are many external factors interfering there

1359
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,600
so your words won't be consistent

1360
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,480
Here are some reasons for the list

1361
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,240
do i think i'll just skip this part

1362
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,720
don't talk about it

1363
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,720
in fact

1364
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:37,920
on a further molecular level

1365
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,280
There is also a phenomenon

1366
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,960
I'm here to say quickly

1367
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:46,120
That is, your genes fall into the so-called Histone

1368
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,960
the so-called main protein

1369
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,160
you are some chromosomes

1370
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,520
Then

1371
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,760
So it by itself suppresses the expression of this gene

1372
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,240
You need to open this thing first

1373
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,040
make it not wrapped in

1374
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,000
You can have genetic expression

1375
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,200
So there's a gene here

1376
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,200
There is a transcription factor

1377
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:09,700
it works weird

1378
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:15,400
even if it is a repressor

1379
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,900
is also an activator

1380
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:22,300
what is repressor

1381
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,800
its turn factor

1382
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,600
it suppresses gene expression

1383
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,300
activator is just the opposite

1384
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:31,700
But in some cases it can do both

1385
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,000
The reason why it can do both

1386
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,900
It turns out that there are other factors at work

1387
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,800
This example is a pretend finite number

1388
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,700
This pretends to limit this Harm to do its job

1389
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:47,600
It has a structure without pretending to be limited

1390
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,600
There are pretending to limit the number of its structures to change

1391
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,300
so we often say

1392
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,700
a certain turn factor

1393
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:56,600
It is positively regulated

1394
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,100
a turn factor

1395
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:59,600
attached regulation

1396
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,760
This way of speaking is too five paragraphs

1397
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,660
Some of these regulators

1398
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:05,860
There are forward and reverse

1399
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:10,960
that controls whether it is forward or bidirectional

1400
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,100
are some other extrinsic factors

1401
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,000
Now here comes the problem

1402
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,500
these extrinsic factors

1403
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,000
how do we know

1404
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,860
the biologist

1405
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:23,060
he because

1406
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:24,900
many things are sprouting

1407
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:25,760
limited knowledge

1408
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:26,560
so he doesn't know

1409
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,160
Then ask our ruler

1410
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,260
more laymen

1411
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:29,760
how do you know

1412
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,460
you don't know of course i don't know

1413
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,960
then i

1414
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,460
but i just told you

1415
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,260
what about statisticians

1416
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:39,200
something mathematicians are not afraid of

1417
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,900
is that we can make some assumptions

1418
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:42,720
we want to start from position

1419
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,200
there is something from the chair

1420
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,000
or part chair

1421
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,720
we go to test the location of things

1422
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,300
made some models

1423
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,660
So let's make an adult's assumption here

1424
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:52,060
OK, if the gene

1425
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,060
with the things it regulates

1426
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,400
in a certain state

1427
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,400
it has positive

1428
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,000
It is a

1429
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,040
positive transfer

1430
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,500
then in another state

1431
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:03,580
it has a reverse feed

1432
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:06,240
But I control this turn

1433
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:09,500
The forward or reverse of these timbres

1434
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,080
I have no idea

1435
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,700
But I make an assumption

1436
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:15,340
Say this, these sound quality, or this state

1437
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:17,880
will be on a certain pitch

1438
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,080
will be shown

1439
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,800
it's just an assumption

1440
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,680
So in this different this

1441
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,580
For example, when Hormono

1442
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:26,180
For example, when Hormono

1443
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:27,880
This State 1

1444
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,980
its fundamental tone it doesn't show

1445
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,220
But when there is less hormonal

1446
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:33,860
This pitch is more than expressed

1447
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:35,460
then i can

1448
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:36,680
There is a hypothesis like this

1449
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,460
I don't need to know that it's hormonal that affects this

1450
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:41,560
I just need to know that it affects it

1451
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,820
Just a certain pitch

1452
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,460
Although this thing is the most important

1453
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:46,960
but its performance

1454
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,920
So I make an assumption like this

1455
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:51,420
So through a situation like this

1456
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,460
In addition to saying that the pitch and its

1457
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:55,160
This is a transfer sound quality

1458
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,880
This is the pitch of its regulation

1459
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,320
It is sometimes a positive regulation

1460
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,520
negative regulation

1461
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,160
but you not only

1462
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,400
Knowing this is true, you would think

1463
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,600
he doesn't matter

1464
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,400
But if you say that through this third gene

1465
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:10,700
When your third gene doesn't express

1466
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:11,600
all green

1467
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,300
just these times

1468
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,900
If it's red, that's all

1469
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:17,900
So it's a very simple concept

1470
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:20,400
that's how it behaves

1471
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,700
But it's so dark here that it's us

1472
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,400
can't be the same

1473
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:28,100
Previously it was only necessary to link two genes to see how similar they were

1474
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:30,600
That now turns into studying three genes

1475
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,100
That's X, Y, Z

1476
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,200
that's more complicated

1477
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,200
What is the level of complexity?

1478
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,800
we are doing

1479
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,900
Like the example just now, when making filial mother fungus

1480
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:42,400
Probably around 6,000 genes

1481
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,400
Of the 6,000 genes you have to take three

1482
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,600
thirty eight

1483
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,000
This is 5878

1484
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,800
Counting is 33.8 triplets of point B

1485
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,700
That's too much

1486
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:54,300
If the quantity is too large

1487
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:56,500
I can't say a triplet

1488
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,400
Just use the priest method just now to look at his relationship

1489
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,000
I must

1490
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,860
Provide a statistic for the computer to calculate

1491
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:06,360
What about the amount?

1492
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,600
How did you recruit them?

1493
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:12,000
I inferred from some of these mathematical statistics

1494
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,080
I'm sorry about this

1495
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,040
i'm just here

1496
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,840
It's just like show off

1497
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,320
Just a reference

1498
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:23,400
So after some statistics, some definitions above, etc.

1499
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,400
found that under such circumstances

1500
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:26,800
there is a nice formula

1501
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,200
You can use this to calculate this

1502
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,160
The formula is simply

1503
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,160
x1 y1 z1

1504
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,960
cover up

1505
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:35,920
multiply up add up

1506
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,000
What is x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2

1507
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,440
That is, the three genes are different

1508
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,600
Performance under condition

1509
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,320
so very simple

1510
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,400
in a certain state

1511
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,840
how much the first gene is expressed

1512
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,880
how much the second gene is expressed

1513
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,600
how much the first three genes express

1514
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,360
just ride it up

1515
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,160
everyone will be punished

1516
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,680
in the second case

1517
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:56,800
add it up too

1518
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,120
So all your data adds up like this

1519
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,560
This is my consideration

1520
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,600
Then this example is called liquid association

1521
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:08,200
Liquid association is a relatively abstract concept

1522
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,760
It is mainly used to describe

1523
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:11,780
this

1524
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,340
correlation

1525
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:15,360
will be like

1526
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:18,180
Liquids flow like water

1527
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,740
Sometimes it's positive, sometimes it's negative

1528
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,040
there will be this fluttering

1529
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,320
image

1530
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,360
What about a formula like this?

1531
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:29,180
In fact, it is equivalent to a

1532
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:31,740
Fissure yes correlation a generalization

1533
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:36,600
Fissure i fissure is arguably the most famous statistician in the world

1534
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:37,380
That

1535
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,180
Yes, it is also looking for a very important statistician

1536
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:40,960
then they

1537
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:45,300
When doing this correlation before, he didn’t follow the same route as Pearlson

1538
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:46,080
he is

1539
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:49,660
Do say I just put this first each

1540
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,780
Statistics first make it a normal score transformation first normalize it

1541
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:56,060
then you

1542
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,600
After normalizing it

1543
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,860
I want to calculate his two correlation is very simple

1544
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
It's fine if the two inherit each other.

1545
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,600
this is their method

1546
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,600
This method has its benefits

1547
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,600
it for those

1548
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,600
The so-called Outline

1549
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,600
Sometimes the data is messy

1550
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,600
some words jump especially big

1551
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,600
This method will not be so Sensitive

1552
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,600
can limit

1553
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:16,900
my method

1554
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,900
almost equal to this replica of it

1555
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:19,900
add an extra gene

1556
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:23,400
But the math behind it is completely different.

1557
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,900
so that's

1558
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,400
I'll do a little math for the benefit

1559
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,400
So here is the Normal distribution

1560
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,400
how did it work

1561
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,800
back to this

1562
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,800
This example of filial mother

1563
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,800
let me tell you one

1564
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,800
only one application

1565
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,800
Because what I said today is that there are several applications left

1566
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,800
But maybe I'm not here because of time

1567
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,300
keep talking about this app

1568
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,800
this application

1569
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,800
looks very complicated

1570
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,800
actually

1571
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,800
you know other results

1572
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,800
The secret is actually quite simple

1573
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,800
This is a

1574
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,600
path of chemical reaction

1575
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,400
Its main purpose is to illuminate the Aquini

1576
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:07,000
This Aquini is crystal dark acid

1577
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,800
It is a series of chemical reactions

1578
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,200
Every chemical reaction involves an enzyme

1579
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:21,000
Its original source is from ancient times

1580
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,800
Gutmey is blessing dark acid

1581
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,200
Through this ARG2 enzyme

1582
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,200
ARG2 is this synthetic beauty

1583
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:38,400
And then make this called Osli Bird Dark Sour

1584
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,400
and then after here

1585
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,600
Its chemical reaction is going this way

1586
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,800
If you come here, the next step is to become this Psytrillion

1587
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,800
is hanging dark acid

1588
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,800
Then wait until the end to get Crystal Dark Acid

1589
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,600
When your crystal dark acid if too much

1590
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,800
it will be broken down again

1591
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,600
This breaks down into

1592
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,640
back to this bird dark sour

1593
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,440
So this is a cycle

1594
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,600
This is quite effective

1595
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,240
Because this has uria cycle

1596
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:08,800
word from here

1597
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,800
After this crystal dark acid is decomposed

1598
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,800
will run deep in this uria

1599
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:17,700
So what about the loop

1600
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:19,700
Although on filial mother fungi

1601
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:22,200
The same is true for the human body and the kidneys

1602
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,540
is a very important mechanism

1603
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:27,000
Then if you look at a picture like this

1604
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,240
look at these chemical reactions

1605
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:30,840
how do i know

1606
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,040
But this is very certain

1607
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,540
imagine these chemical reactions

1608
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:40,340
In fact, it is like a string of processing factories.

1609
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:41,640
so stuff comes in

1610
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,640
I just parse it

1611
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,640
So let's say

1612
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,340
when you want to take this thing

1613
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:48,440
this thing must have

1614
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:49,640
So the more this thing

1615
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:52,740
I will show more of this thing

1616
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:54,940
But my goal is to follow this

1617
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:57,240
So if say this CR2

1618
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,440
nuclease

1619
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,240
have something

1620
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,240
also expressed a lot of words

1621
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:05,120
Then this Ostiny thing

1622
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,960
Will it be broken down immediately?

1623
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,560
Then it would be wrong to do false work for nothing.

1624
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,280
So you'd guess that yes

1625
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:15,360
When ARG2 it expresses high

1626
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,560
When the synthetic surface is high

1627
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,560
this thing shouldn't exist

1628
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,720
It should express less

1629
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,640
Otherwise, you just go in

1630
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:24,680
It will be digested immediately, and it will be a waste of work

1631
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:29,000
So you would speculate that the relationship between these two

1632
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,640
should be related

1633
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,880
This is higher and this is lower

1634
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:34,440
Then let's see if Data looks like this

1635
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:39,040
Sorry, this jumps a few pages first

1636
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:43,200
I'll come back to this later

1637
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,840
Let's look at Data first

1638
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:49,560
This data is for everyone not to look at these two lines

1639
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:52,920
Also don't look at these red dots or different colors

1640
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:56,320
Every point is a data point

1641
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,880
This information is from what we just talked about

1642
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,160
The information on Sale Cycle

1643
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,100
Exactly the same but I use it to study different things

1644
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:06,000
You said oh oh, check to see if there is anything related

1645
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
It cannot be positively correlated without correlation

1646
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,700
If it is positively correlated, it should look like this

1647
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,700
Direct phase is not reverse

1648
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:15,000
Not reverse is no correlation

1649
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,200
that's not relevant

1650
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,500
Then we just speculated that

1651
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,500
Just now I speculated that it was these two, if so

1652
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:27,600
Cell needs RNG saying these two should have a negative correlation

1653
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,000
why didn't that

1654
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Then I said ok then it's okay

1655
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Then maybe if the cells disappear forever, it will be RNG

1656
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,500
Not called RGN

1657
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,000
it maybe sometimes it doesn't need

1658
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,500
how do i know

1659
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:42,000
How do I know when it's needed and when it's not

1660
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,500
Then I will use this liquid manual to learn how to use it

1661
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:47,500
My hypothesis is that maybe at some point it will

1662
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,500
maybe it doesn't

1663
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,000
what time does it want

1664
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,500
Maybe some of the elite will be shown when it wants to

1665
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,000
which elites

1666
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,500
how could I know

1667
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,000
I don't know it's okay

1668
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,020
find one by one

1669
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,820
so how do i find it

1670
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,360
this is me

1671
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,520
I take this thing as x

1672
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,840
This thing is regarded as y, so there is no

1673
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,900
without that

1674
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,680
correlation so it is

1675
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:21,500
To count this liquid association

1676
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:28,420
For each gene, there are about 6,000 genes in total, and each one is counted, so the basic calculation is not too big

1677
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:30,980
then arrange it

1678
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:35,080
and then went to see its largest and found

1679
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,640
The eighth largest here is the small

1680
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:38,920
this

1681
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:41,740
negative biggest

1682
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:46,080
Find this gene as soon as you look for it, that's good because there are 6,000 genes

1683
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:48,140
The eighth is around here

1684
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,920
so this

1685
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,740
It can be said that it was hit

1686
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,500
hit

1687
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,560
Not only that

1688
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:59,400
Here it is, if you look more closely

1689
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,320
But you can see that when the CPA is

1690
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,380
when performance is high

1691
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,920
it has a negative correlation

1692
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:08,960
The negative correlation we want is when

1693
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,260
CPA is when performance is high

1694
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:13,560
When the CPA performance is small it is

1695
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,840
multiply positive correlation

1696
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,400
Is this relationship reasonable?

1697
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,460
let's look back

1698
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:24,320
What does it mean when this gene is expressed high?

1699
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:28,680
If this thing is high, it can take this Gutmin

1700
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:32,280
Decomposition then yields this

1701
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,820
This metabolite of Carbomile phosphate

1702
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:36,120
What about this metabolite?

1703
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,640
Can Oscling with this

1704
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,720
Through this ARG this synthesis

1705
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,000
to synthesize this

1706
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,020
so

1707
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:46,860
When this you do RG0

1708
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:49,420
Right and wrong need not only Oscling

1709
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:51,720
At the same time you also need this Carbomile

1710
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,760
Then you need Carbomile

1711
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,080
It's about to come out. If you don't have this synthesis, you won't have it.

1712
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:56,840
so

1713
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:00,120
My explanation is that when the composition does not show

1714
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,800
It will represent that the cell needs RG0

1715
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,480
When the cell needs RG0

1716
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,800
ARG2 is just negatively correlated with CR2

1717
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,800
So this is completely represented by our picture

1718
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:17,440
Another situation is when CR2 does not perform

1719
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:20,040
It happens to be DR's WareRound

1720
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:21,600
just another situation

1721
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,680
That is, when there is no here, it means that there is no need here

1722
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,080
those are the times when you don't need it

1723
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:31,800
In that case, it means that the cell

1724
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,240
Maybe this arginic acid is too much

1725
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,280
If there is too much arginic acid, it will break down

1726
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:39,040
So when you want to decompose this thing should show

1727
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,120
So when you are still tall

1728
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,360
If your stuff is not high

1729
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,400
that's bad

1730
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:49,800
It will also be forced on this may produce more

1731
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:52,680
So the best solution is when this high

1732
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:55,680
The god you produce is digested immediately

1733
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,560
broken down

1734
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:00,080
Use CR2 performance to decompose it

1735
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,400
So this is a rather subtle

1736
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:06,000
right here

1737
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,400
The enzymes in the shells that we often eat

1738
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,000
Inside a little angry bag

1739
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
by the expression of this gene

1740
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
complicated inside

1741
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
6000 genes inside

1742
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Let's watch these

1743
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
It's all in this picture

1744
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,500
Then you look out and see it's totally irrelevant

1745
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:28,000
But you should use statistical methods well

1746
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,000
go

1747
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
From what is already known to infer some positions

1748
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Can find a quite reasonable explanation

1749
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Then this method can be used a lot

1750
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
means you have two genes

1751
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I'm going to find a third gene that regulates these two

1752
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
there is a way

1753
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
That can also be said in reverse

1754
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I one I can start with a gene

1755
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
See which genes it can regulate

1756
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
wait

1757
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Then this method can also be extended to

1758
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
more genes above

1759
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
That uses some other math

1760
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,200
Are these just for reference?

1761
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,000
that's in this

1762
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,600
ah early words

1763
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:09,640
ah for publication

1764
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:12,200
During the paper period, I went to find some

1765
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,200
this on the gene

1766
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,200
Information

1767
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,000
and found

1768
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:17,400
there is a group

1769
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:20,500
The information can be brought here

1770
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,200
do some of this

1771
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,300
Ah, the research on human genes

1772
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:27,540
According to that information

1773
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,440
ah

1774
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:30,340
At that time, for some reason

1775
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:32,540
Special interest in dementia

1776
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:34,440
then read some books

1777
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,540
then just

1778
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,940
ah see some of this

1779
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,840
major gene

1780
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:41,440
that is

1781
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:44,040
ah on top of this

1782
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,940
I just saw some black ones that are called

1783
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:49,240
amino acid beta peptide

1784
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:50,540
this thing is made of

1785
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:51,940
a large protein

1786
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,940
After two of this chemical this

1787
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,040
Enzyme changes, this

1788
01:26:57,140 --> 01:26:59,540
7. I just feel that I can use the lump at the bottom to compare

1789
01:26:59,640 --> 01:26:59,940
want

1790
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,500
show it

1791
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,400
That's the big one

1792
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,600
This red part is

1793
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:09,400
This is what caused your brain age

1794
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,600
eat the most important ingredient

1795
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:15,200
Then this ingredient needs to be cut by two enzymes

1796
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,200
Then one by one

1797
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:20,400
just on the left

1798
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,600
Then a knife is on the right

1799
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,600
Those two are two different enzymes

1800
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,900
good

1801
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:30,400
That

1802
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:34,400
Then the APP’s role in general physiology

1803
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,800
Actually it's not clear

1804
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:38,800
Then in 2001

1805
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,200
it was me just then

1806
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,600
Really like this liquid phone

1807
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,000
When I first started researching

1808
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,800
This paper just came out

1809
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:48,400
Then what

1810
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,400
it's taken from some chemistry experiments

1811
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,200
It found this APP?

1812
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,500
with these two proteins

1813
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:57,900
were caught together at the same time

1814
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:59,100
They use a

1815
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,000
a kind of that

1816
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
It's like saying you're going to commit a crime first.

1817
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
he opened the cell

1818
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
then make some discoveries

1819
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
found this thing combined with him

1820
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
This thing is combined with him

1821
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
if that thing is put together

1822
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I would deduce that he should have

1823
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Fang Xiong should have related

1824
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Fangxiong related words

1825
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
on the expression of this gene

1826
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
not necessarily relevant

1827
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
because i this is my original subject

1828
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
then he is

1829
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Correlation is indeed very little

1830
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
His correlation is very little

1831
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
so i say

1832
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Then this is EH maybe use liquid

1833
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
The method learned

1834
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
So I put this APP

1835
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
When X and Y are regarded as one of them

1836
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Then

1837
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Here is the human body

1838
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
So this whole gold probably

1839
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
At that time their gold piece

1840
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
technology limitation

1841
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
probably made almost ten thousand

1842
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
So just the same job

1843
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
one to find those related

1844
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
first to find this

1845
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
PSEN

1846
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
this is the code

1847
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
this

1848
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
oops , a little too fast

1849
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
you want to go back

1850
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Sorry, one of them may have been skipped

1851
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
OK, that one dropped in the second place

1852
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
That is to say, simply explain

1853
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
this

1854
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
what about my result

1855
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
It's in that very high ranking

1856
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
just found this

1857
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
it has related this

1858
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
PSAN

1859
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
then this thing is

1860
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Gama Security

1861
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
what about the other one

1862
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
same, good

1863
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
This X, that's another

1864
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
was caught at the same time as it

1865
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
then go to see

1866
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
The result you see is this

1867
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Base 2, that is

1868
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Veta Side's APP

1869
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Cricked Entire

1870
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Simple explanation, just use this method

1871
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
it's ingenious

1872
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,020
That is, in 10,000 manager heads

1873
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:05,160
Use this XY to find

1874
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,320
I found out that it happened to be these two audio loaders.

1875
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,020
Its score is very high

1876
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:14,620
And then down here is an app

1877
01:30:14,620 --> 01:30:16,720
That's because there is a doctor

1878
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,560
I know that at UCL

1879
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:19,920
this postdoc

1880
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,860
He is from Human Genetic

1881
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:24,460
he sees these results

1882
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:26,400
he is very interested

1883
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,460
So I found his instructor

1884
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Come and discuss with me

1885
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,460
Then his team is right about this

1886
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:36,100
Multiple Sclerosis

1887
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,160
polymorphism

1888
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:39,360
very interested

1889
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,960
the european white

1890
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,960
This specifies a lot

1891
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:47,040
Then it's a Neuron's this

1892
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,440
Simply put, the immune system

1893
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,700
this cell that is attacking this nerve

1894
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:54,640
put this outside this

1895
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:56,000
The Mining of the students

1896
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,500
persecuted it

1897
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:00,040
so he starts this

1898
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,700
there are some scars coming out

1899
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:05,500
Then it recurs after a while

1900
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:10,000
that's usually looking for the gene

1901
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,500
Generally, it is the route of Genovice

1902
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:16,800
That is, where do you go to see people doing some Genovice

1903
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:21,700
at that time i was

1904
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:23,900
Learning while doing Liquid

1905
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:29,100
So what is used is a quite different method from ordinary people.

1906
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,900
What was used at that time was

1907
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:35,600
This data is completely Geneexpression data

1908
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,300
Not this marker data

1909
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:38,400
gene expression data

1910
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,800
At the same time, these Geneexpression data

1911
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,900
It has nothing to do with this Multiple Sclerosis

1912
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:46,200
this one is

1913
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,100
researching this

1914
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:51,600
i-Zen is different from i-C8

1915
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:55,000
Then additionally these data are

1916
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,900
looking at the different organs of the body

1917
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:00,100
expression of these genes

1918
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
how to be different

1919
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:07,000
These data are completely unrelated to Multiple

1920
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,000
And what about the MVP?

1921
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
is a gene

1922
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
it is

1923
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,000
It is the cell in this Mining

1924
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
In the outer layer of nerve cells, there are many manifestations

1925
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
So it's a very important Proton

1926
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
So take it as X

1927
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
what is Y

1928
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Y is provided by our collaborators

1929
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
They were very interested in this gene at the time

1930
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Because they are this difficult TIN

1931
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
where he found

1932
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,000
After some genetics above this Typing

1933
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:46,000
It was found that this gene is likely to be related to this Multiple Sclerosis

1934
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
So he just provided the gene

1935
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
and this gene

1936
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Then the rest is our bioinformatics method

1937
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
find these information

1938
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Then some with Liquid's hands

1939
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Then I found this gene in the second place early in the morning

1940
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,280
Then use this gene

1941
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:04,100
And do liquid association with this gene

1942
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:05,120
is xy

1943
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:06,140
find it related

1944
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,420
Find a lot more

1945
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:08,700
According to different data

1946
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,260
This way you get a table

1947
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:12,540
Most importantly, this gene

1948
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:13,820
the word of the gene

1949
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:17,160
Our collaborator is very interested

1950
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:20,220
because they were doing a

1951
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:21,500
Research

1952
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,040
The gene itself is interesting

1953
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:24,320
Because it is Glutamate

1954
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:25,600
Glutamate is a

1955
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:27,400
neurotransmitter

1956
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:29,180
it's very important

1957
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:32,260
This gene is specialized in this neurotransmitter

1958
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,840
A very important thing that is sent from the inside of the cell to the outside

1959
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:37,140
this

1960
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:38,400
protein

1961
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:41,220
OK this

1962
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:42,240
because

1963
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,560
sorry this is barely watchable

1964
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,120
Because I'm using MaconTosh

1965
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:50,440
Every time you turn to this, it turns like this

1966
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:51,720
of course it doesn't matter

1967
01:33:51,980 --> 01:33:54,280
These incomprehensible things

1968
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:58,320
In fact, it was my team who did Gino typing

1969
01:33:58,580 --> 01:33:59,360
found this

1970
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,780
there is an association

1971
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:04,100
But what?

1972
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:07,180
The problem is because they use too little data

1973
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:08,620
Only about 300

1974
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:11,020
So we are publish wanting to publish

1975
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:13,300
So referee told us to do more

1976
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:14,860
That

1977
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:18,580
Because of this personnel, resources are limited

1978
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:20,480
so we didn't go ahead

1979
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:21,760
But what?

1980
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:24,980
It happens to be a gift that fell from the sky

1981
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:26,100
just in

1982
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:29,440
In 2007

1983
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:32,240
在 New England Journal of Medicine

1984
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:34,000
There is an article like this

1985
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,300
this is a very large

1986
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:38,240
generalized study

1987
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:39,280
he used

1988
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:43,940
There are about 12,360 subjects

1989
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:47,080
There are 609 family to you etc.

1990
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:48,840
very large and is

1991
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:51,340
Cross-centre and transnational cooperation

1992
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:54,840
They use this generalized association method

1993
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:56,800
Find the two most important experiences

1994
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:00,320
One is IL-2R and the other is IL-7

1995
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:00,500
ah

1996
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:02,700
Then I see iOS 11

1997
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,800
This thing seems familiar

1998
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:09,100
I'll go back and have a look

1999
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:14,600
Hey, if you look at it, this iOS 11A you look at here

2000
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:19,140
So from this totally unrelated genics

2001
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:20,100
Franchon data

2002
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,600
Through this and this Genex

2003
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:23,800
so go find this

2004
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:26,900
Then this item is already in referring’s hands

2005
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:28,200
So we just write a letter saying

2006
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:30,500
that this

2007
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,200
find is

2008
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,400
New England Journal of Medicine

2009
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:37,300
The gene found in the magazine is our gene

2010
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:41,100
So this will be unlocked soon

2011
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:41,800
actually

2012
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:45,000
story behind that is

2013
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:46,300
at this

2014
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:49,800
There is a marker near our gene

2015
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:53,000
Use their data with this generalized data

2016
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:55,600
look this his this

2017
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:56,900
Lot score

2018
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
His significance is in fact

2019
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:00,200
better than this

2020
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,360
This I-L7R is still high

2021
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,840
It means more significant

2022
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:06,640
at the same time

2023
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:08,400
What about the two GINs?

2024
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,040
actually very close

2025
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:13,160
This is the I-L7R

2026
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:16,720
With this SL C1S

2027
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:18,760
actually very close

2028
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:20,400
So what about this paper?

2029
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,400
it's easy to accept

2030
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:23,600
But here

2031
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:26,040
One thing this Person is complaining about

2032
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,080
Actually this I-L7R

2033
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,200
I'll go back and check

2034
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:31,680
Because the sound is very deep

2035
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:33,280
Just check my E-mail

2036
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:37,280
I sent my Corelibrator in an e-mail

2037
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,040
In fact, there is a special mention of this

2038
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,040
I tell everyone yes

2039
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:42,360
Between this GIN and this GIN

2040
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:44,560
very short gap

2041
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,480
Then this is also very important GIN

2042
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,720
can they do something

2043
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,160
This Validation and the like

2044
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:53,360
but they didn't do it

2045
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,520
The reason is because of that E-mail

2046
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,280
Bounced back

2047
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:59,320
they didn't send out at all

2048
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:00,080
so this

2049
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,040
But he might not be able to do it even if they are the same generation.

2050
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:07,440
because the words here

2051
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,640
Sometimes it's later

2052
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:15,760
We still have a project that is working on this new era

2053
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,160
It is solid playful

2054
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:17,960
what about here

2055
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:20,080
There is more information involved

2056
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,800
We do Geneexpression probably

2057
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:24,600
Get the sneeper array of 30,000 Gene

2058
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,240
like this next generation

2059
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:28,960
Its output this data output is

2060
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:30,760
200 MacBits and more

2061
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:33,000
This is a very large data

2062
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,520
So behind this needs a big ID team to do it

2063
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,680
Then we have some computer

2064
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:42,480
use some of this

2065
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:45,760
Through some clusters and so on

2066
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,400
do something like this

2067
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:50,640
Then we also have a very good note

2068
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,880
he may not be here

2069
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,600
but he designs

2070
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:57,760
The most important thing is to hope that here can

2071
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,000
through some information

2072
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,200
Accidents that can happen automatically

2073
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:04,120
Because what we often encounter when dealing with these problems is

2074
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:05,880
you do something today

2075
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:06,920
do something tomorrow

2076
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:08,800
If there is no system

2077
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,400
error prone

2078
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,520
If this error occurs, it will affect many

2079
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:14,960
so everything

2080
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:17,520
We're all about wanting to be able to

2081
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:18,200
online

2082
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:20,000
Can use online code to get it out

2083
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,240
If you are right, you will always be right

2084
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:24,040
If you are wrong, of course you will always be wrong

2085
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:26,640
So you have to be very, very careful when you first start

2086
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:29,400
After that, it doesn't matter

2087
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:31,680
Today is this person's operation, tomorrow is that operation

2088
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:32,960
you won't have

2089
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,520
This information will be passed on

2090
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:37,800
generate some errors

2091
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,360
so information

2092
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:43,920
Engineering talents help our lab a lot

2093
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:49,000
Then I want to end with this thing

2094
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:51,880
in 2004

2095
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:53,640
this

2096
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:55,840
Professor Joe Cohen

2097
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:57,160
he is

2098
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:58,760
one of rockfellow

2099
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:00,120
very famous population

2100
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,380
Professor of Genetics

2101
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:04,300
He wrote articles like this

2102
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:05,900
The picture itself is very obvious

2103
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:06,800
Mathematics is

2104
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:09,900
biologist's next microscope only better

2105
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:13,500
biologist's mathematics next physics only better

2106
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:15,200
that means yes

2107
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,900
in biology

2108
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:18,900
Is it a problem in many trees?

2109
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:20,100
are developing

2110
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:21,900
After that, there will be more and more business

2111
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:26,700
So this is a pretty important direction

2112
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,600
That

2113
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:31,800
Almost over

2114
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,500
Then this liquid association

2115
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:36,100
Here is a profile from this creature

2116
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:37,600
Concepts developed

2117
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,400
Can it be used in other contacts?

2118
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,400
I'm sure there are many places to use

2119
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:46,400
Actually, I told my daughter before

2120
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,700
I want to explain what this liquid association is

2121
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:51,600
Just think about your relationship with your friends

2122
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:52,500
good relationship sometimes

2123
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,500
That's like repository creation

2124
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:56,400
but when you're in a bad mood

2125
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,300
The machinery is broken

2126
01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:00,000
Then your relationship with him may be

2127
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
So your positive negative

2128
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Does it change with your mood or how?

2129
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Sometimes it will be positive and sometimes it will be negative

2130
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
look at it from another angle

2131
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
look at another question

2132
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,000
It should be a few days from now

2133
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Many people may have to take the exam

2134
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Then you see from the exam

2135
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Your preparation time and your grade

2136
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Is it effective?

2137
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
You may talk to your children, friends

2138
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
noisy for a long time

2139
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Sometimes it works

2140
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Sometimes it doesn't work

2141
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
The more you prepare, of course the grades will come.

2142
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I have been preparing for half a day

2143
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
But these many different backgrounds

2144
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
For example, a state of health

2145
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
If you say you are in good spirits

2146
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
you are of course very effective

2147
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
The more you prepare, the better your grades

2148
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
then your health is not good

2149
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
you have been sick

2150
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Then you'll be wasting your time if you're ready.

2151
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Then maybe there is no correlation

2152
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
or have cross-correlation

2153
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
So this idea that liquid has learned

2154
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
is actually quite common

2155
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
almost in personal life

2156
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
He can use various

2157
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
This data, its calculation method is also very simple

2158
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,000
In that regard, I think this

2159
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Basically the relationship between these two variables

2160
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,000
In fact, is it forever?

2161
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,000
then i want to carry the message here

2162
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
OK everybody

2163
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
That's some relevant information

2164
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
If you are interested, go and see

2165
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Then I want to thank some past colleagues

2166
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:32,000
And then there are colleagues who are currently working on this

2167
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
And this Haida team

2168
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
There is also this Director of Combat Skills who can turn around in the sea

2169
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
And provide us with a lot of information

2170
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
ok thank you everyone

2171
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Thanks

2172
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
What's your problem?

2173
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:15,040
I would like to ask a question, now we are making the entire genetic line of the wedding paper in Taiwan

2174
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:21,460
Came to find this Target Drog Dachanghai seems to have a special achievement

2175
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:27,020
But the cost is very high, and health insurance costs more than 20,000 yuan

2176
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:33,420
I think this will have a relatively stable price in the future around your research journal

2177
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:35,720
or expand to other cancers

2178
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:39,320
I think you may be asking the wrong person.

2179
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:42,880
Because we do statistics, I can't help

2180
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:48,520
I guess our job is to help people who develop

2181
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:53,380
Then maybe be able to find a more effective marker

2182
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:55,940
If you only need the proper information

2183
01:42:55,940 --> 01:43:00,300
If those markers say that elder brother lost

2184
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,300
not much and very effective

2185
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:06,900
In fact, its price should be much lower than that of

2186
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:09,000
so this is

2187
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Eventure will also have

2188
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,300
The ultimate goal, of course

2189
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:16,140
The whole method should be quite civilian

2190
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:19,960
So these things like genetic testing are still

2191
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:23,800
the future is if it really works really

2192
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:28,400
It's really easy to promote

2193
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:32,240
Must be pretty cheap when mass produced

2194
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:36,840
like i just mentioned

2195
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:39,400
EGFR Mutation on lung cancer

2196
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,240
Now I listen to that Professor Yang

2197
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:45,300
You have been judged as lung adenocarcinoma

2198
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:49,900
Especially if you are a gland, you will definitely make one like this

2199
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:50,940
Pest

2200
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:52,460
EGFR TEST

2201
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:56,040
Because there are already medicines over there that can target this aspect

2202
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:59,880
Then our current work is mainly aimed at

2203
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Of course that medicine is effective, but not everyone is effective

2204
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
still some people are bad

2205
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Now it's just the gas meter

2206
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
He wants more than 20,000 yuan

2207
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Just look for that gene's calmness

2208
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Calm down, I don't know about the holidays

2209
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Thank you

2210
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Hello, Professor, I would like to ask

2211
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Questions about experiments

2212
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Professor, I just said that liquid sometimes learns to choose

2213
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,000
The professor mentioned that he needs many conditions

2214
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,000
That Error to find out the Target

2215
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Well, I have two questions

2216
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,000
One is to say how many conditions are needed to do this

2217
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Then there is the second question

2218
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
like this is to do it yourself

2219
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Or is there some online

2220
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:55,000
It may be that someone else shares it for analysis.

2221
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
i think that

2222
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
in two programs

2223
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,600
One is to tell you how to do it

2224
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:07,000
When can some interesting results be found

2225
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,800
Or the results that are believed in by statistics

2226
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,400
How much condition does this need

2227
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:14,900
This depends on your liquid itself first

2228
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:17,500
About the size of your earring

2229
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:20,200
If it is a student of Liquid, his strength is very high

2230
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:23,800
Then the conditions you need will not be very big

2231
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:26,300
Then we did an analysis before

2232
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:28,700
About the same number of conditions

2233
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:32,400
Probably around 50 or so

2234
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,900
If the fifth is

2235
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:38,100
Roughly the results obtained are statistically

2236
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:41,900
Probably none that reaches a certain level of salience

2237
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:43,700
this is this one

2238
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:46,200
According to our semiation study

2239
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:52,100
Is it possible to use the data of this public domain

2240
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:54,100
my answer is yes

2241
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:57,200
Because the first one is useless

2242
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:00,200
With the lady over there, you can get it out and you can

2243
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,400
some relationships can be found

2244
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:05,400
and then further confirm

2245
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:08,600
that in fact we are

2246
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:12,300
like the examples I just gave

2247
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:13,900
is an example of Multiple Squares

2248
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:17,400
That's exactly Public Domain stuff

2249
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:21,100
at the same time

2250
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:25,200
Now maybe your own personal laboratory

2251
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,600
Take some data yourself

2252
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:28,100
that amount may not be much

2253
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:31,000
Then you can find some examples of genes

2254
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Moderators can go further with these little experiments

2255
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,500
I found several genes

2256
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:37,000
Then you have to go further

2257
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:40,600
Go and see the genes related to the influence of these genes

2258
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:44,700
You can go to the Internet to look up more information about this performance

2259
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:45,900
Then through this method

2260
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,000
come with SIMELE

2261
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,400
Students who use Corealization or Request

2262
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:52,000
In fact, our lab uses both

2263
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,800
Then you can get some more information

2264
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:56,700
then bring it back

2265
01:46:56,700 --> 01:47:00,000
Then you can take your experiment a step further

2266
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,740
So these are auxiliary

2267
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:04,100
or tools

2268
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:11,020
Hello teacher, thank you for your lecture

2269
01:47:11,020 --> 01:47:12,360
i want to ask

2270
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:14,860
When using liquid association

2271
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:17,600
There are a lot of situations coming out

2272
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:18,840
but i think

2273
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:20,000
According to what you just said

2274
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,140
It seems that there are at least three situations

2275
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:24,140
Positively correlated positively correlated with each other

2276
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:26,120
Of course if this

2277
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:27,740
positive correlation and positive correlation

2278
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:29,040
There are also positive correlations with each other

2279
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,040
or the one of omniscience and interrelationship

2280
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:32,440
If the demarcation point is not adjusted properly

2281
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:34,440
In fact, the data is still messy

2282
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:35,840
That

2283
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,840
At the beginning of the research

2284
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:41,080
For example, how did the professor find out

2285
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,580
How to cut those states

2286
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:43,920
OK

2287
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,640
the cutting words

2288
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:49,680
because our theory is

2289
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:51,380
no need to cut

2290
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:53,340
we're thinking of it as this

2291
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:55,540
state is a continuous state

2292
01:47:55,540 --> 01:47:57,780
Then through some calculus methods

2293
01:47:57,820 --> 01:47:59,420
go get it out

2294
01:47:59,420 --> 01:47:59,920
so

2295
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,400
It's not that it's OK, I'll cut to this side, to this side

2296
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:04,500
then compare

2297
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:05,300
That is

2298
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:08,400
I originally thought the same way

2299
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:10,700
But want to say like you just said

2300
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:12,800
Then I have to cut 50%

2301
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,400
or 30%

2302
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,500
how is it possible

2303
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:17,300
Every gene is different

2304
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:19,300
Well, that's actually what we saw in the end.

2305
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:21,900
so that's why this

2306
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:22,500
Well

2307
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:23,800
do some math with words

2308
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,800
There are always some people whose problem is

2309
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:26,700
oops

2310
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:28,800
Although uh intuitive

2311
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,700
It is easier to think about it with this discrete method

2312
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:35,200
But doing the math above is to think of it as a continuous

2313
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:36,200
will be easier

2314
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:38,300
So here, the whole sear

2315
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:40,100
this definition of mathematics

2316
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,900
is to use an assumption to say that this change

2317
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:45,700
In fact, the change of state is a continuous change

2318
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:47,700
Then it has normal discretion

2319
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,400
Then through a lema called a stine

2320
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:53,100
that's professor of stine fire

2321
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:54,100
then he does some

2322
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:55,600
uh director

2323
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:58,400
And then at the end of the day to quit that simple company

2324
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:00,200
and then to the last words

2325
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,900
Then find out how to cut this gene

2326
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:05,300
that's easier

2327
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:07,500
You can try it with

2328
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:11,200
We are on our computing workstation

2329
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:13,300
On the Internet, we do two ways

2330
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:15,900
One is to use the Maxmolecular method

2331
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:17,700
The other is to use Discrete

2332
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:19,200
directly to calculate

2333
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:28,100
Director Li's speech is wonderful

2334
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:30,400
i meet you after the afternoon

2335
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,900
Won't go there again...

2336
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:35,000
run away

2337
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,200
i have two questions

2338
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:41,400
The first one is about the lung cancer thing you just talked about

2339
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:49,100
Later you also mentioned that non-smoking women have a high incidence of incidents in Taiwan

2340
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:51,900
Are these five signature genes related to that?

2341
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:54,800
That is to say, did you subset when analyzing?

2342
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:57,600
See which respects are in the end

2343
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,700
with that...

2344
01:49:58,700 --> 01:49:59,600
that...

2345
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:05,600
The paper of the five genes, I think they didn't do the classification like that at that time

2346
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:12,000
At that time, according to the title, he just flew the small one

2347
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:15,200
that lung cancer

2348
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:20,800
For this classification, it is divided into this adinocasinoma

2349
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:23,600
is our latest job

2350
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:28,400
And then our latest work is now this adinocasinoma

2351
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:34,000
At the same time, it is based on whether he has EGF ammutation

2352
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,600
Let's do a comparison and then look at the formula on his molecule

2353
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:42,800
So what are you still doing because it's important

2354
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:45,600
I heard that only the ones in Taiwan have this kind

2355
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:48,400
In comparison, there are actually a lot of Asians

2356
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:52,400
For Japan, there are a lot of things to wait for

2357
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:56,400
But there is a fundamental

2358
01:50:56,400 --> 01:51:00,000
That is, Teacher Ya and the others are most interested in it.

2359
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,600
That is, although everyone has discussed a lot about the connection method

2360
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:07,000
Anyway, I think this Adino Castiglino

2361
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,640
It was Adino Castiglino who was only recently recognized as

2362
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:12,140
of a new form

2363
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:15,940
In the past, it was probably mixed with Squamers

2364
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:17,040
recent words

2365
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:21,400
So according to the world this is just an international organization

2366
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,600
Have had it tested on the ring saying it's a

2367
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,940
So in this piece

2368
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:29,440
At present, what I want to know most is

2369
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:34,180
According to Mutation and without Mutation

2370
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:36,080
what is the difference

2371
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:39,180
It's not just a single Mutation that makes the difference

2372
01:51:39,180 --> 01:51:42,580
There are already many other classics in the surrounding area that have followed suit

2373
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:45,980
That's what I'm currently working on

2374
01:51:45,980 --> 01:51:47,880
So we base this

2375
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:52,080
Copy number of variation and gene expression等等

2376
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:53,980
I believe many people are waiting to see

2377
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:55,380
this very important program

2378
01:51:55,380 --> 01:51:58,080
The most important thing is to need a large sample

2379
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
the most important

2380
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
I have another question is

2381
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
about for example

2382
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
When it should have been broken

2383
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
It is Messy data

2384
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
In fact, for biologists

2385
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
A lot of it is that the system itself is very messy

2386
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
So it's not easy to do experiments

2387
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
part i believe many

2388
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
biological data

2389
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Without doing statistics

2390
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:20,000
because make it last and equal to one

2391
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
There are many times when we do experiments

2392
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Because a lot of money

2393
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
or resources limit

2394
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
hardly anyone says

2395
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
do an experiment to repeat

2396
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Experiment twenty times can

2397
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
到statistically significant

2398
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
so i don't know

2399
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
developments in this area

2400
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Said whether it has reached a certain level

2401
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
So can biologist

2402
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,000
some suggest

2403
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
How to use the least method

2404
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
results that can be obtained

2405
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
able to be treated like this

2406
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Statistically significant data like this

2407
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
because you know now

2408
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
final result

2409
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
A while ago they found out that

2410
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Almost even if it's a different company

2411
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
with the same data

2412
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
The results of these cups are about 40 to 50 completely different

2413
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:08,000
So, for example, by using your method to see

2414
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Could you please help us solve these problems?

2415
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
How to design an experiment

2416
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I think your topic is very good

2417
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Because you said N equal to 1

2418
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
In fact, many times although you have a lot of N

2419
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,000
But the last words are only in the case of a N equal to 1

2420
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Because another experiment was placed

2421
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Although they took 100 pictures

2422
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,000
But his N and N are under completely different circumstances

2423
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Then this one is to think about it from the perspective of the network

2424
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
That is to say, if today

2425
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Many units are willing to send money down

2426
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Then do some more systematic design

2427
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Then don't say you just thought of something

2428
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
just think of what to do

2429
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Between many N equal to 1

2430
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,000
can also have some hosts

2431
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,180
will be better

2432
01:54:01,180 --> 01:54:02,140
If so

2433
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:04,440
you can combine different labs

2434
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:06,640
A big M comes out like a string

2435
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:08,480
that's there

2436
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:10,980
Now it is through the Internet

2437
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:12,880
a lot of this information

2438
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:14,080
you can take it

2439
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:15,580
charge up

2440
01:54:15,580 --> 01:54:17,420
Do some Metal Analyze

2441
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:19,280
I don't really like Metal Analyze

2442
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:20,020
this idea

2443
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:22,420
Because many times it is Trivial

2444
01:54:22,420 --> 01:54:23,360
ready to use

2445
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:25,160
that means ok i do this

2446
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:26,600
what to see

2447
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:27,420
Significantly

2448
01:54:27,420 --> 01:54:29,200
I will make it a PV

2449
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:30,700
those things have

2450
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:31,900
Significantly

2451
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:32,900
Just post it as a PV

2452
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:34,480
In the end you use a

2453
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:35,600
Same level company

2454
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:36,780
A PV that was born

2455
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:37,980
Actually Metal Analyze

2456
01:54:37,980 --> 01:54:38,780
its

2457
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:40,080
significance

2458
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:41,140
more than this

2459
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:42,940
it should go to enalyze

2460
01:54:42,940 --> 01:54:44,140
After all

2461
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:45,180
which laboratories

2462
01:54:45,180 --> 01:54:46,680
Why with which labs

2463
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:48,820
Which laboratories will be the same

2464
01:54:48,820 --> 01:54:50,120
with which labs

2465
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:51,820
why is it different

2466
01:54:51,820 --> 01:54:52,480
That

2467
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:54,060
where is the same reason

2468
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:55,460
or same reason where

2469
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:57,160
The reasons for these are the number of positions

2470
01:54:57,160 --> 01:54:57,760
right

2471
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:58,500
But the number of positions

2472
01:54:58,520 --> 01:54:59,500
if you have eyes

2473
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:00,000
it will be

2474
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,200
then no one knows

2475
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:02,600
So we can make an assumption

2476
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:03,920
Perhaps these positions are

2477
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:07,320
Maybe it can be expressed through some variables

2478
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:08,720
those variables maybe

2479
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:10,600
In fact, it may be the condition of the West

2480
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:11,800
how like

2481
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:13,200
Then these things can

2482
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:15,520
expressed by certain genes

2483
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:16,800
So in fact there is a way

2484
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,520
When there were many genes

2485
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:19,600
Liquid Association

2486
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:21,760
in fact a

2487
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:22,520
I think

2488
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:25,200
The formula of Liquid Association is not necessarily necessary

2489
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:26,920
but the basic idea of ​​it

2490
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:29,440
It should be able to be used to manage

2491
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:32,400
Because the most important thing is to find some potential factors

2492
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:34,480
If the factors that existed before

2493
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:36,000
Original words look

2494
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
two time to make it

2495
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,600
The result is not related at all.

2496
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:40,720
that may be under certain conditions

2497
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:42,000
they will have related

2498
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:47,880
ask your boss

2499
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:49,840
just now you mentioned that

2500
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:52,520
Is it correct to match the big A with the small questions?

2501
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:54,480
That G type

2502
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:56,800
Then A and G are not compatible

2503
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:57,840
That

2504
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:00,000
If say cross match

2505
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,000
G matches T, A matches, okay?

2506
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
G matching type, A matching type

2507
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Like this, is it possible?

2508
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,000
The No. 8 calculus seems to be forming wind

2509
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:16,000
So fixed A must match T

2510
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Can't change the cross

2511
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
No way, it has some chemical properties

2512
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:26,000
It's swords between each other, how about its attraction

2513
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,000
and its structure

2514
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
In fact, this is an important concept

2515
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
In this way, it will be...

2516
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:38,000
It is this DNA that will make a pair and not mess up

2517
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:43,000
If it is not like that, then the structure is very unstable

2518
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Hello Professor

2519
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,000
We are now working on the Biohometase part

2520
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Generally speaking, there are two ways

2521
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
One is the statistical way you just talked about

2522
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,800
It’s just that everyone compares it, and what many people are using is data mining.

2523
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:07,400
In your opinion, what is the biggest difference between these two people?

2524
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:10,000
Or how do people feel that these two

2525
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Is there some kind of special opinion?

2526
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
ok that's a good question

2527
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:20,000
That data mining is actually an informatics scientist

2528
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,000
I don't know if it was stolen

2529
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Imagine a rather new way to develop statistics

2530
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
because statisticians

2531
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:38,000
This statistic itself sounds like crying and tasteless

2532
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
data analysis sound analysis data

2533
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
to call out a

2534
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
How about BetaMade in Chinese?

2535
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
data mining

2536
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Mining doesn't sound good.

2537
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
But carbon health is not good

2538
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
But English itself is very nice

2539
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Yes or no

2540
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
is data mining itself

2541
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I'm human so what do you think

2542
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
data mining you turn it into data

2543
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:05,280
Do you want to poke around like the unminer?

2544
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:06,740
Does that sound like a lot?

2545
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:08,940
It's not that hard, is it?

2546
01:58:08,940 --> 01:58:12,740
But DataMind is going to dig some information

2547
01:58:12,740 --> 01:58:17,740
A lot of statistical concepts are used there

2548
01:58:17,740 --> 01:58:21,740
There are many things of course a computer scientist

2549
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:24,940
himself according to his intuition

2550
01:58:24,940 --> 01:58:27,340
can match many things

2551
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:29,040
these things

2552
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:32,640
Let's not talk about which school this is.

2553
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:37,640
For example, DataMind uses a lot of support vector machines

2554
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:42,640
If it supports vector machine, it is used for classification

2555
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:46,040
Vasus has a set of discreement like RFVsure

2556
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:47,040
Who is better then?

2557
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:53,040
So that actually depends on the structure of the different states

2558
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:58,040
When there is a lot of noise in the Vsure of RFVsure

2559
01:58:58,040 --> 01:59:00,040
it will be more effective

2560
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,820
SupportVeq's Machine is in the data

2561
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:05,000
its this

2562
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:06,960
Less noise

2563
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:09,160
But the state is complicated

2564
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:13,600
When the Covered Manifold is more complicated

2565
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:14,560
it will be more effective

2566
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:16,960
So each has many different degrees

2567
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:17,800
That

2568
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,200
concepts used

2569
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:21,320
you could say statistics

2570
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:22,260
aka mathematics

2571
01:59:22,260 --> 01:59:23,720
anyway

2572
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:26,400
It's all logic

2573
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:29,920
A methodical approach to data analysis

2574
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:32,960
so it can be useful in certain situations

2575
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:37,560
OK

2576
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:38,560
besides

2577
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:39,360
close first

2578
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:40,300
we today

2579
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:42,700
this page you know so far

2580
01:59:42,700 --> 01:59:44,060
thanks again

2581
01:59:44,060 --> 01:59:44,860
Thank you Zhou Da
