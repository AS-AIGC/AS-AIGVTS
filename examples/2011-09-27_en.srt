1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,680
with we believed

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
President Zhang, distinguished guests, welcome to today's feast of knowledge

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So today we are very honored to invite President Zhang Guoen, President of National Normal University

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Demonstration universities are leaders in domestic education circles

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So today he will talk about a topic that also belongs to his profession.

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Research on the Application of Information Technology in Education

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Principal Zhang is a very outstanding scholar in this field

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He was once a professor and librarian at the National Model University

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Professor and Vice-Chancellor and then President of Model University since February 2010

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He's very young. He's 47 years old.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So I think he is the youngest national university president in the country

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But he just reminded me that there is another one, but the scale of the school cannot be compared with the Normal University.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So he's a very young, promising and highly academically accomplished principal.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He is a very representative scholar in his field

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,300
He has won two National Science Council Excellence Awards

16
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,300
a total of six years

17
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,600
he too

18
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,600
Executive Director of Zhizhihui

19
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,100
especially important

20
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,300
As far as I know, he is the founder of the Digital Learning Quality Certification Center

21
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,600
centralized builder

22
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,100
Then this center is in my impression

23
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,600
Certification and Promotion of Digital Learning in Taiwan

24
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,200
had a great effect

25
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,900
Professor Zhang and I have a special marriage

26
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,600
Because of a national action plan funded by the National Science Council

27
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,500
Digital Archives and Digital Learning National Program

28
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,200
Then this year and next year will end

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,000
So this project is ten years old

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,800
what about this plan

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,300
It turned out to be two plans

32
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,100
One is the national travel plan for digital point leaders

33
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,000
One is the National Roadmap for Digital Learning

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,500
National Travel Plan for Digital Point Leaders

35
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,100
In my impression

36
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,800
at the very beginning

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
Should be the first in the world

38
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,700
with the power of the country

39
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,100
The Power of a National Action Plan

40
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,600
to drive digit length

41
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,000
then digital learning was established later

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Probably the first in the world

43
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,500
I'm not sure about this part

44
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Probably the first in the world

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,040
Directly the first of its kind to promote digital learning with a national program

46
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,840
The two programs were later merged

47
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,240
then it's a very special project

48
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,800
More than ten years ago, the logarithmic point was long

49
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,040
Including me can be said to have no idea

50
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,840
I don't know what is the digit length

51
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,920
After ten years I think many people

52
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,080
At least you've heard the term

53
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,560
even know how

54
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,200
and it's easy to do

55
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,400
Nobody heard of digital learning even a decade ago

56
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
At least I'm not familiar with this myself

57
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,560
But now Taiwan's top 1,000 companies

58
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,040
Basically almost all have been more or less

59
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,560
Using digital learning to train employees

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,080
So I think the development of these two fields

61
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,680
It's very special in our country

62
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,360
Principal Zhang Guoen is a leader in digital learning

63
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,040
He just said what I just introduced

64
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,120
Digital Learning Quality Certification Center

65
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,280
He is the founder and general convener

66
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,760
And he also serves as a digital point chief

67
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,240
Co-host with Digital Learning National Initiative

68
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,360
I am the host

69
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,720
So the co-hosts of the digit-long segment

70
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,800
Center Adult Principal

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,800
He used to be the director of the Information Institute, Zhongyan Information Institute

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,880
He is the person in charge of the digital learning side.

73
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,800
So today we are very honored

74
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,040
Can invite such an important scholar

75
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,600
Let's talk about a subject he's doing well

76
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Research on the Application of Information Technology in Education

77
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,240
We welcome Mr. Zheng with warm applause

78
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,400
Thanks

79
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,640
We thank Mr. Wang Huyan

80
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,040
In addition, there are many old seniors of mine here.

81
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,440
and our school teachers

82
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,640
and classmates

83
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,640
In addition, representatives from various

84
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,640
then i want to be very happy

85
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,840
And it's a great honor to be here

86
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,640
Share our information technology with you

87
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,840
Applications and research in education as part of

88
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,040
Then I think this field has developed to the present

89
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,240
In fact, it's been almost 20 years

90
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,440
from the earliest very simple

91
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,040
One is used in the classroom

92
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,840
We call it the Association for Integrating Education

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Until now, apart from the integration of information into blood

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
but also promote to industrial application

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Especially the computer has changed a lot

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Now there are camp technology and mobile technology

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So its platform is getting more and more complex

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
then we all know the theory of trading

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's a hundred years old It's a hundred years old

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But this century-old history usually takes place in

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Classroom Inside the actual classroom

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
a result obtained

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But now there is an information platform

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The information platform is very complicated

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
A platform with a marketing platform A platform with mobile technology

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Internet-based platform

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Of course there are platforms for personalized learning

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So under such a platform

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
we may have to rethink

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Think about how to develop

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
A Variation in Trading Theory

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
how to apply

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Put information technology on top of our entire school

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
There are also students' self-learning

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But because of such Yangu

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It does raise a lot of questions

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
what's the problem

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,600
Children often forget themselves as long as they are in front of the computer

119
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,000
so there will be a phenomenon of fame

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The so-called poisoning happened.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,500
It's very easy to develop a warm habit

122
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,000
If Xin Xin gets used to it, there will be a big problem

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
big problem

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,500
So he does have a lot of hangovers

125
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,000
that under such aftermath

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
how do we apply it

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
At present, Taiwan is integrating information into classroom teaching.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,500
I think there should be a history of 15 years

129
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:41,000
Now most of the teachers have the means to use computers to help his teaching

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The student also has the means to use the computer to aid his own learning

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So where is the problem now?

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,500
Today's technology changes too much

133
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,000
Because there are many sequelae

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So how do we import more bone-setting places

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Then let this bone-setting place make a greater contribution to education

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I will go to the mainland for a while

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Central China Normal University

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's when I knew they had a big, big plan.

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Taiwan probably can't compare

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It is also a plan to promote information and agriculture into teaching

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Related to Elanin

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
His promotion is an astronomical figure

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
300 billion RMB

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
300 billion RMB

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
is very scary

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Therefore, it means that the production value of this supernatural power is also very large.

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
but we also know

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
They hardly know how to push

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He's a lot like what we were like twenty years ago

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
When information first arrives in education

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
don't know how to push

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So from an industry point of view

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Our business opportunity is great

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
we can make their money

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
but we can teach him what was ten years ago

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
After he had reached ten years ago

157
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We have progressed for ten years

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So use an angle like this

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
In addition to this, there is actually another very important

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
There may be a big change recently

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Twelve Years International

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
In fact, in the past 12 years, I think about Taiwan's future development

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If we look at it from a long-term perspective

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It can indeed change the entire education pattern

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
at least three years

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It used to be six years, now it's three years more

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Therefore, there are nine years in which normal news can be obtained.

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We know that it should be under the joint examination system

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So our students' academic achievement

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Academic achievement of our students High academic achievement

171
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It does not mean that its future competitiveness is high

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Especially in the era of Internet, computerization and technology

173
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
you have so much ability we must develop

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
For example, we often say that we want to promote night reading

175
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
children need to read more night

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But the ranking of our night reading

177
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Ranking is not high in the world

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm not tall, I remember like

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
is better than that one

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
One that is lower in Macau

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Macau is a gambling country

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We come in for night reading part is lower than theirs

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
How could such a problem be caused?

184
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Because our education stage

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
from primary school

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
First grade through high school

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We never teach students to find jobs

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
We also never teach students

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Get it from reading

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
get very interesting

191
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
we just let him read

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But you can see

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
when do we teach young children

194
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Organize knowledge from professional reading

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Find out the key points in the professional reading

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
These organize knowledge and find out the key points

197
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It is often made by our Pingliang

198
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
we are not now

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Middle school has to take the entrance exam for high school and high school has to take the exam for university

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
There are many booksellers who have created many Pingliang editions.

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
how to organize this

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Then I said why this sequelae

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
getting bigger

204
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
There are too many things to read in the Internet age

205
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
is on the Internet

206
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But even this basic quality

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
did not build

208
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Information provided by the Internet age

209
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Instead, many students

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,120
students are a burden

211
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,560
is a burden

212
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,920
So there is a side effect like too many

213
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,680
So I said why the influence of the country will be so great in 12 years

214
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,000
because we at least

215
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,560
If our policy is done well

216
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,160
all our parents

217
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,520
If you brighten his thoughts and eyes

218
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,120
maybe we can cultivate

219
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,600
What we call in educational terms

220
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,240
Make it Metascale

221
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,600
Metagability

222
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,520
so-called metacapabilities

223
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,040
What is meta-capability

224
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,800
That is to say, I can activate the ability of knowledge

225
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,200
I can activate the ability in my brain knowledge

226
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,040
For example, your communication skills

227
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,480
your ability to read

228
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,920
your inquiry skills

229
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,080
right

230
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,480
wait for these abilities

231
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,520
Opportunities that can be cultivated in the future

232
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,320
should be more

233
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,480
Of course there is a very important premise

234
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,280
we must make good use of

235
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,800
extra three years

236
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,000
Make an overall plan for the whole course

237
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,440
I hope that within nine years

238
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,160
cultivate these abilities

239
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,040
Absolutely better than you to cultivate Guoying's learning achievements in natural mathematics

240
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,280
This manpower is more important

241
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,840
I think this is our big government

242
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,000
if you can see this

243
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,640
maybe the twelve kingdoms

244
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,840
It is really important for the future development of Taiwan

245
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
is a very important opportunity

246
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:22,640
That's because people today may come from many different places

247
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,000
so i assume

248
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Try to use more common

249
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,840
In a relatively unprofessional way

250
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,840
let's talk about this topic

251
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,840
then if there is any question

252
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
we can discuss

253
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,840
let me share

254
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
that information is in the educational app itself

255
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
There are several tasks and goals

256
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,840
Finally, we hope to continue to do

257
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
also hope to be able to complete

258
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
First

259
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
The first of our learning journey

260
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,840
throughout the learning process

261
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,840
How we use information technology

262
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,840
to help humans learn about human development

263
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
thank you all

264
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,200
In fact everyone must have a progress in his learning process

265
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,200
Then in this learning process

266
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,600
For example, if you study

267
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,300
Is there any part in this course of study

268
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,000
We can help through information technology

269
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,300
come to help you and can develop some of your academic and reading skills

270
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,100
Now an obvious example is ebooks

271
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,300
I think everyone knows about e-books

272
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,300
Whether it is the iPad or our domestic manufacturers

273
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,400
Epad is also good

274
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,700
The era of e-books has really come

275
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,500
but where is the problem now

276
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,500
We now have an e-book for everyone

277
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,100
But can he let us do in-depth homework reading?

278
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,800
And the way we're designing e-books now

279
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,100
All are using the Skin reading method

280
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,800
What is the so-called skin reading

281
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,300
general practice book

282
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,900
He can't help you draw the key points for the first e-book, right?

283
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,200
Then you can't write down your thoughts.

284
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,200
Like many of our books there are

285
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,460
Then there is a little activity, let you use your brain

286
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,500
it has none in it

287
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,500
So in a stage of development like this

288
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,000
Will there be any sequelae on the liquid poison?

289
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,700
But whether this road will go, it will definitely go to Asia

290
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,200
but this way

291
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,300
is there a good way

292
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,700
channel it into the most important development of our learning human

293
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,900
If you are watching when you were young, watch Jin Yong when you were young

294
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,900
maybe it doesn't matter

295
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,900
it doesn't matter

296
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,700
But if you read ordinary textbooks

297
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,500
Read math, read English, read nature, etc.

298
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,700
Let you know how to let you in the whole liquid poisoning process

299
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,500
Emphasis on learning workforce development

300
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,800
So in order to achieve this one

301
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,300
That's obvious from the specifications of our e-book

302
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,700
to modify

303
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,500
That is, it must increase some

304
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,900
The functions related to the study of liquid poison put it in

305
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Well, there are already many groups doing this

306
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,900
you are working on this one

307
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,800
Is it possible to come up with the specifications of a good e-book

308
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,760
Then on the students' learning

309
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,060
it is helpful

310
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,860
This is a part worth studying

311
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,900
Then in addition now

312
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,460
In a competitive environment in the 21st century

313
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,160
Because a recent statistic

314
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,060
in the twenty-first century

315
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,860
What kind of manpower will affect future competition

316
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,760
you personally will have an impact

317
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,760
One of the most important is cooperative learning

318
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,760
a cooperative learning

319
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
this used to be possible

320
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,420
We in Taiwan rarely pay attention to this

321
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,420
We value personalization

322
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,920
Is there any way we can cooperate with others

323
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,420
Collaborate to solve common problems

324
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,920
You may need this one to enter the society

325
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,920
The ability to cooperate

326
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
How to train the ability to cooperate

327
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,920
In the Internet age, it could have helped acting skills

328
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
in a kaohsiung

329
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,920
one in japan, one in america, one in taipei

330
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,920
those four

331
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
How can one work together to solve some problems through the Internet?

332
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Networked Collaborative Learning Capabilities

333
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Or the ability to cooperate and solve problems together

334
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
how to build it

335
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So how can we help it in this process

336
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This is all in the whole training process

337
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
A part of what we hope to be able to achieve

338
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
so this is the first

339
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Second, we hope to use the digitized eye of a fellow student

340
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
To enrich the experience of ability learning

341
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and learning methods to improve it

342
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
this is very interesting

343
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
once there was a teacher

344
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
a primary school teacher

345
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Then he wants students to find information through the Internet

346
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and then make a report

347
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Then I remember his first topic

348
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He wants elementary school students to organize a

349
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Life of a Butterfly

350
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Then I hope that after the students sort it out

351
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
then find a report

352
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,020
After the result report came out, the teacher was very sad

353
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,860
Because everyone's homework is similar

354
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,100
Why? Because all use copy passed

355
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,560
All with copy passed and no bets

356
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,720
students did not gamble

357
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,180
So later he laughed at himself and said

358
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,100
I was going to let them know that butterflies

359
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,380
Turns out it only taught them the human power of the computer

360
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,540
called copy passed

361
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,220
Nothing else was taught

362
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,780
So Taiwanese teachers are also good.

363
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,980
he will wake up

364
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,460
He'll think that's wrong

365
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,780
this will be problematic

366
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,780
He later came up with another topic

367
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,460
like the insect doctor

368
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,220
But does he want students to read?

369
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,560
So you're going to teach the insect doctor when the report comes out

370
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,500
must focus

371
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,840
You have to draw key points to be able to teach

372
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,380
As a result, when he got it back, he was very sad again.

373
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,760
Why are you sad?

374
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,520
Because everyone wrote another trick called underline

375
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,380
called underline, it will do nothing

376
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,620
that will do nothing

377
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,820
So you see that computer tools do have a lot of sequelae

378
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,160
Then later he thought

379
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
he doesn't do that much

380
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I still can't read anything like this.

381
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Originally identified as Baidu Film

382
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Learning by doing should be for students to learn by doing

383
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The result is that the teacher does the middle school by himself

384
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Because he wants to distinguish the difference in nutritional work

385
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And it's hard to separate

386
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Because everyone is similar

387
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So he thought it was wrong

388
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
he wants to change the method

389
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
he said that's good

390
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Don't use that word for this

391
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You just use Powerpoint

392
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
don't write too much

393
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
All in Powerpoint

394
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And he also stipulated that Powerpoint can only be five pages

395
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
right

396
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and the focus of each page

397
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
his title

398
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
set the title

399
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Each bar below that has its own phone

400
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
In fact, this is a change of concept

401
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
that is

402
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
In transaction theory there is a

403
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
phonetic writing

404
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
construction theory

405
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Constructive theory he has an emphasis on

406
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
all knowledge

407
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
build by yourself

408
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
what you want

409
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
self-construction

410
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,460
must give him a scaffold

411
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,400
This is like we cover the yellow fish

412
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,720
give him the scaffold first

413
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,140
After he wrote Ye Duo

414
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,000
The scaffolding needs to be removed slowly

415
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,340
So his homework is done with the concept of scaffolding

416
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,860
That is to say he brought up a lot of headlines

417
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,400
The title is just to tell the students

418
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
you follow the direction of this title

419
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,440
go find your material class

420
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,040
This is a bit of belief

421
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,440
human beings who believe in knowledge

422
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,200
or this

423
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,160
As for Powerpoint, teachers don’t have to use it

424
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,440
Students can also use

425
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,000
Students organize knowledge through Powerpoint

426
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,040
Where are the resources?

427
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
on the web

428
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,740
but we must also admit

429
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,400
Too much information on the internet is wrong

430
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:38,740
right

431
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,040
and the most wrong

432
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,240
I want to learn the scariest of the above

433
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,040
will cause a lot of misconceptions

434
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,800
What is the concept of myth

435
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,800
It's just a false notion that you think you're right

436
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,640
essentially it's wrong

437
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,700
but you think you're right

438
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,300
However, if myths and concepts are not rooted in childhood,

439
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,400
Sometimes growing up is hard

440
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,120
There is indeed such a lot of myths on the Internet

441
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,920
if you don't teach your students

442
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,500
It is very likely that students will step into the trap of knowledge

443
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,820
That myth must be rectified.

444
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,360
if not corrected back

445
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,640
big problem

446
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,680
You can do experiments when you go back.

447
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,760
We have been taught since childhood that

448
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,300
what will happen to finger ye liang

449
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,440
ears will fall off, right?

450
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,520
right

451
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,040
is this right or wrong

452
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,840
wrong right wrong

453
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,920
Wait a minute and go back up to see if you dare to point

454
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,980
Many people really dare not point out

455
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,520
we have done

456
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,620
Not only dare not point it out, but some point it out reluctantly

457
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,900
You will solve the strange ears

458
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,240
That myth concept is very complicated and difficult to reverse

459
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,800
So the sooner you get it all out

460
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,600
the reverse is better

461
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,400
It's smart to have a teacher

462
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,400
he

463
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
he knows us

464
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
There are a lot of mistakes on the Internet.

465
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,500
So he can't let Xiesheng look at it casually

466
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,000
He just had a homework

467
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,500
that homework is very simple

468
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
So once one direction is changed, the whole will be changed

469
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
he has a website

470
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
There are many mistakes in it, and he will tell you

471
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,500
There are many mistakes in it

472
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
But you guys go online and find out what's wrong

473
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
do you know what i mean

474
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,000
this is one

475
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,500
Use the words of the Internet to achieve the purpose of cooperation

476
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
This is a very simple method

477
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,500
So like our digits are long

478
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Actually there is an important part

479
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Taiwan has many precious things

480
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
We want to do something recently

481
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Of course it has its difficulty

482
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,500
For example, because

483
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
There's a lot of trouble being the principal at Shida University

484
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
the most painful thing for me

485
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
Every time I go to the art exhibition

486
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
I really can't see some art exhibitions

487
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
There are some abstractions that I can't see either

488
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
don't know how to appreciate

489
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
so i was thinking

490
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
if there is someone next to you

491
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
I have someone to accompany me to see

492
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Then they are explaining this painting to me

493
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,000
how nice he is

494
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So I sometimes go to the boss of the art department

495
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
teacher go together

496
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,500
And every time they tell me

497
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,000
Just let you read the book by yourself

498
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
oh

499
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,500
because

500
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,000
because there are many abstractions

501
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,500
oh

502
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
But it's hard to explain

503
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Maybe my math literacy is too low

504
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,000
He didn't bother to explain to me

505
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So I then thought of a question

506
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Is it possible for me?

507
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
is it possible

508
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I took an iPad

509
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
He has a camera or an Epad camera

510
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,500
Then let's take a picture of this picture

511
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,000
After taking a picture, he will naturally

512
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Someone who will automatically have a commentary will run out

513
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
then help me explain

514
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,500
can it be done

515
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
sure

516
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,000
Now this technology is called Augmented Reality.

517
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We are working on an agreement now

518
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
right

519
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
like this

520
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Music is the same

521
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,500
we listen to music every time

522
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
right

523
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,500
like this week

524
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,000
me a week

525
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm going to be forced to listen to music

526
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,500
Then every time you have to go to the first position

527
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,000
I say the first position

528
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and put me in the fifth position

529
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
so i saw you later and said

530
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
not the first position

531
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What move do we have? Fifth position

532
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
that's the same

533
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
you always have to understand

534
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So we just want to say

535
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Is there any technology to help us look at the music industry?

536
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't use the listening industry, but the watching industry

537
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What do I use to take a picture and take a picture of it

538
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
or after taking a picture

539
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
it naturally explains to me

540
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I explain a whole change this whole night

541
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That's why I say technology can achieve this

542
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
it is a secondary attack

543
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Then in our digital content

544
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
There are actually a lot of works of art in the collection

545
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
that's a lot of interesting stuff

546
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
that interesting thing

547
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Can it become a learning eye?

548
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
How can this place be a family?

549
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Let something die, a treasured thing

550
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
In the end, it becomes a living teaching material

551
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I think it's worth dealing with

552
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
In addition, there is another

553
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
whole learning technology

554
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Resources that can make our digital learning

555
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Can do sustainable use and development

556
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,500
I still can't think of how to use it

557
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,900
after that you can't imagine

558
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,600
for example

559
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,500
in education technology

560
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,200
The first was the personal computer

561
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,100
Then slowly developed into the Internet age

562
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,300
Then the Internet age put

563
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,600
place of acting

564
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,900
Various people put it together

565
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,700
right

566
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,700
and then progress to mobile vehicles

567
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,000
Now Yingduan Technology

568
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,600
and then a variety of

569
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,400
The technology of information application is getting more and more advanced

570
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,800
Then the e-book came again

571
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,000
Then the change function of the function of the camera is

572
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,900
getting better and better

573
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,200
so sometimes say

574
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,900
Although our resources

575
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,700
Now we don't know how to use

576
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But maybe after a certain stage of technological development

577
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,600
Its use comes naturally

578
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,700
i just ran out

579
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,300
But do you want a Suviva?

580
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,700
Because Suviva can make us finer

581
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,700
save that side

582
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,100
Then there will be a chance to use

583
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,200
Then there is another one

584
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,100
Implementation of information education

585
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,400
Hope to improve the former

586
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,000
digital literacy

587
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,100
Of course now what we call

588
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,100
Digital literacy does not mean how high your credit standing is

589
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,100
right

590
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,100
You are not all...

591
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,200
not all citizens

592
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,100
write credit science

593
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,600
no

594
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,400
Instead, use existing credit tools

595
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,300
how to solve his problem

596
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,700
solve his life problems

597
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,800
solve his learning problems

598
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,800
This becomes increasingly important

599
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,600
One training for one ability

600
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,700
It's already booked

601
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,000
of course there is an audience

602
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,300
There are about six core competencies in digital literacy

603
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,700
Six core competencies

604
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,300
Each core competency has one

605
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,100
Various types of indicators

606
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,000
then we wish to say

607
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,300
Future Credit Courses

608
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,400
From elementary school to university

609
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,100
Of course, this is excluding the sacrifice of undergraduate credit department

610
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,700
Is an ordinary student

611
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,000
you are a law student

612
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,300
You are a student of the Chinese Department

613
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,000
Then what kind of credit quality should you keep in mind?

614
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,100
this is

615
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,100
is more and more important

616
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200
at least the first

617
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
We saw

618
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,620
After you take it, after you touch it

619
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,120
You can use at least 50% or 60% of the functions

620
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,960
Now children and students

621
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,020
Almost everything can be solved like this

622
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,320
They also rarely read the manual

623
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,500
rarely read that manual

624
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,900
like you hold a cell phone

625
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,100
For the students, I don't think they will read the manual

626
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,300
He takes it, touches it, hits it

627
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,700
That's the way we are, but we can't see it.

628
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,620
And now we don't know what

629
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,080
Our Dean Wang Hu wrote the article

630
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,920
Our current Guowen ability seems to be relatively poor

631
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,080
So that manual

632
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,380
I don't know that the manual is influenced by politicians

633
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,580
because of jump thinking

634
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,580
So what was written in the manual is really jumpy enough.

635
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,220
you really don't know what he's writing

636
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,740
right but it's weird

637
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,740
Why can't young people understand

638
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,740
we don't understand

639
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,940
It may be that the result of the training is not the same

640
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,040
That's rare. Now there are few such manuals.

641
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,760
Almost you go online, you have to go online if you want to read the manual

642
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,300
The basic application ability will become more and more clear

643
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,240
Now what is our biggest concern for the next generation, you know?

644
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,840
cyber crime

645
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,240
This is cybercrime is a serious problem

646
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,140
it's sometimes a temptation

647
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,760
Well, we have come across a few cases

648
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,600
It may be that our own education has not been done well.

649
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,460
Then let the children really face legal problems

650
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,000
especially at what stage

651
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,340
After high school

652
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,040
And it just so happened that these students just retired

653
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,840
push into the university

654
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,840
he already has school practice

655
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,340
But before entering the university formally, there may be

656
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,140
three to four months or even half a year

657
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,140
Because of rejection, isn't he?

658
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,840
He didn't just pass the exam, right?

659
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
so for a long time

660
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,540
But everyone ignores a lot

661
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,540
So if there are any parents here

662
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,840
Children are very careful just at this stage

663
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,340
They just turned eighteen

664
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,340
Many children do not know

665
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
in our law

666
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
18 is an adult

667
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So they were bored for a while

668
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
often on the site

669
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
then do something you shouldn't do

670
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
they may find it interesting

671
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
these suspects find it funny

672
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
He also thinks there's nothing wrong with it.

673
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
As a result

674
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Because we have a lot of internet police

675
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's over because of this

676
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
these have the case

677
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
There are these cases

678
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
But after he broke the law

679
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Also know that he is 18 years old

680
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
he is an adult

681
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
so this is unfair

682
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Then this part is what we want

683
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
always pay attention

684
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
sometimes we see

685
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
This problem with many cybercriminals

686
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
it hurts so much

687
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
He didn't mean to commit a crime at all.

688
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
like now we mentor graduate students

689
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Where is the most feared student

690
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Our advisors are also scared

691
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Because copypad is so convenient

692
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
They often inadvertently violate intellectual property

693
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
there will be that phenomenon of plagiarism

694
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,760
I copied the letter, this has to be dealt with

695
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,520
So I said, how to avoid cybercrime

696
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,220
information literacy

697
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,720
very important part

698
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,520
So this is also worthy of our discussion

699
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,320
Ok, so I put some applied themes

700
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,080
make a very simple explanation

701
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,840
First, the establishment and attack of digital learning environments

702
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,800
We want to build a digital learning environment

703
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
Digital learning environments now probably have many

704
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,400
E-Learning platform, E-Learning platform

705
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560
Now the most popular is the future classroom

706
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,400
That is to say, the classroom in the future

707
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
full of a

708
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,800
For example, touch screen, electronic pendulum

709
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,760
There are various resources over there, right?

710
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,480
How to do this teaching

711
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,720
How to teach on this platform

712
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,920
The teacher almost had to re-believe

713
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,600
Faith how to use this platform

714
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,240
The content in it, how to design your teaching content

715
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,960
How to design, this must be considered

716
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,560
there is another

717
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,320
The current camp terminal in this digital platform

718
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,720
We often go to the camp to calculate

719
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,400
Camp platform

720
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,480
If the camp terminal platform is really complete, it will really affect

721
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,520
A problem with many education in Taiwan

722
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,060
For example, inside the camp

723
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,600
many of his software

724
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,160
All belong to APP, this kind of software is not big

725
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,200
That software doesn't do much

726
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,480
so later

727
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,040
If this develops to a certain stage

728
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,360
It is very likely that when you learn certain information through the camp terminal

729
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,640
fragments of your knowledge

730
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,200
This is a piece of knowledge

731
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,020
So is there any sequelae when this is a fragment?

732
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,860
A knowledge restructuring ability of students may be more important

733
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,140
more important

734
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,920
effects like this

735
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,720
will be more and more

736
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,280
The trend of technological development is irreversible

737
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,140
But in the whole process of technological development, it will cause the problem of technological hindrance

738
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,200
hinder the development of other fields

739
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,520
Then we all have to pay attention to this, so the platform

740
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,820
Then there is this platform because there is a platform

741
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,300
So our study

742
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,840
Identification of the community

743
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,300
i learn to shoot

744
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,160
This human soul community always experiences

745
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,940
So some teachers can use the human spirit community

746
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,360
Gather the power of many other students

747
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,020
to tutor students

748
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,140
There is also doing

749
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,100
so well done

750
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,780
It really helps a lot

751
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,980
but you can't do well

752
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,500
there may be many problems

753
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,520
What kind of students does the Human Soul community treat?

754
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,440
very helpful

755
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,560
This is a result of some research

756
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,220
Very helpful for the kind of shy student

757
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,060
our often shy students

758
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,700
He dare not interact with people

759
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,720
He dare not ask a question

760
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,480
right

761
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,600
dare not express an opinion

762
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,960
But you through this kind of networking

763
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,560
When the soul community

764
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,000
Because he won't face to face

765
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,240
face to face

766
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,520
he through the Internet

767
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,360
he can make a good interaction

768
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,880
make good interaction

769
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,600
so this part

770
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,480
From a certain point of view, his academic achievement will be improved

771
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
So have one like this

772
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,040
So the establishment of this whole learning environment is

773
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
more and more complicated

774
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,000
and more and more

775
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,960
that now

776
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,200
In universities, like Normal University, there are about 60% of the teachers

777
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,600
Multiple digital learning platforms

778
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,700
But digital learning platforms are not the only ones

779
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,000
which means we teach

780
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,300
The interaction between people is still very important

781
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,000
we can't ignore

782
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,700
A brainstorming question between people

783
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,400
Not only through the Internet platform

784
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,500
So now the network platform has slowly developed into

785
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,000
A study of the so-called Blenderland powder layer

786
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,300
at a certain stage

787
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,800
There must be a face-to-face communication between the teacher and the students

788
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,400
Internet-based processing at some stages of learning

789
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,300
For example, let me squeeze an example

790
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:47,800
Let's talk about the relationship between the nine planets and the sun

791
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,300
The relationship between the nine planets and the sun

792
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,300
We know that the earth rotates and revolves

793
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,300
But this is very abstract

794
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,300
very abstract for students

795
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,800
So how do you take the abstraction and turn it into

796
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I can do it easily through the computer

797
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Otherwise you have to make an actual model

798
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I let the students watch

799
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I'll use a simpler example

800
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
There is a teacher in our school

801
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I heard that he used to teach like this

802
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm of course taking the simpler example

803
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Let's say you teach that kindergarten student

804
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Then you have to teach what a pig is

805
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
right

806
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It is very likely that students do not

807
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
he has never seen a pig

808
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
so pigs may be very abstract to him

809
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
right

810
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
It is very memorable for the teacher

811
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You said this pig is very memorable

812
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
But it is very abstract for students

813
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
he may not know what a pig is

814
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
how do you teach

815
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
so sometimes the best way

816
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
just do what you teach

817
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Then the teacher plays the pig for the students to see

818
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
it becomes a memory

819
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
is that impossible

820
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
impossible

821
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So through multimedia

822
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I help you through online multimedia

823
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So something like this

824
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It's because he used to have a teacher named psychology

825
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
he often talks

826
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
A Mental Change in the Monkey

827
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
So I often play the role of a monkey for sacrifices

828
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
right, that will make it clearer

829
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
so something like this

830
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Not many teachers like that know how to sacrifice

831
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
So what do you do, you have to do it through Domati

832
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
let the computer sacrifice

833
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Something like this, so the computer itself has a

834
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
A very important part is

835
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
what can he play poses

836
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Valence's role

837
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You mean the gestures and voices he plays through the computer

838
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Some abstract ideas that make sacrifices clearer

839
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
better understanding of abstract concepts

840
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Then it can be built on this platform

841
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Another one is

842
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
tools for learning activities

843
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Now we have to develop a lot of learning activities

844
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Many things, what we call

845
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Editing tools for All-Sold-In-Two textbooks

846
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Editing tools for learning activities

847
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Then how to design this

848
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
We call it the intersectional design tool

849
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
how do you script

850
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,500
Lesson plan How to integrate with resources on the Internet

851
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,160
Integrate it, an evolution of this tool

852
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,360
There are also interfaces and tools that facilitate human-computer interaction

853
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,460
this is very important this current development

854
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,960
more and more complicated more and more complicated

855
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,500
I was talking about augmented reality, right?

856
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,660
take reality take your real reality

857
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,960
Then amplify it with some information

858
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,200
that you can achieve better human-machine interaction

859
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,860
Then there's that mental reality, too.

860
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,120
If you watch TV or watch movies

861
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,460
you brought a universe

862
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,360
When you stretch in the universe

863
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,660
into the computer world

864
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,960
then you act as an electron

865
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,960
or act as a computer's current

866
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,660
find information everywhere

867
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:54,120
attract that reality

868
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,120
It's all about the human-machine interface.

869
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,040
But where is the big problem of the man-machine interface now?

870
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Currently very troublesome three drops

871
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I have three drops now

872
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Why is three drops so troublesome

873
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
If you don't usually touch three drops

874
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
if you just watch the three drops movie

875
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
There are a lot of people who really get dizzy

876
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I really do

877
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Because we have never had such a belief since childhood

878
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And the three drops themselves

879
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
often when not handled well

880
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
There will also be learning disabilities

881
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
there will be learning

882
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
you just can't concentrate

883
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
i can't focus at all

884
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Similar to this problem came out

885
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
don't say anything

886
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
do this briefing

887
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It's easy for me to do this briefing, isn't it?

888
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
someone does this briefing

889
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
In order to increase the effect of human-computer interaction

890
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Then there's a butterfly flying around

891
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
right

892
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
effect?

893
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
and every time it comes out

894
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
The word "it" is used to run in.

895
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Is it this way

896
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
then sometimes

897
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Then one more word fell down

898
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
so again

899
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
the scariest thing is

900
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
When the word fell down, there was still that killer body

901
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
right

902
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
isn't it scary

903
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I see a lot of teachers in the past

904
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Just started to be a self-confident farmer

905
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Those teachers will be scolded by me

906
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
why did i say two hours

907
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
or after two hours of class

908
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You still have this kind of display.

909
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Then there is that word running down

910
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And kill the car

911
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I said it's no wonder that student didn't go crazy

912
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Really, you can try it

913
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
right

914
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
really going crazy

915
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
and more multimedia

916
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
more severe cognitive load

917
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
What does cognitive load mean

918
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
because we have a short-term memory

919
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
that short term memory

920
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
At the same time, the information that can be accepted is limited

921
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
if you take many words at the same time

922
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
that's going to be a problem

923
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
then i will

924
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
why butterflies

925
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
what does this butterfly have to do with this

926
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
why do you want a butterfly to fly around

927
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
disturb us

928
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
right

929
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
really capable

930
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
There are only two commonly used media

931
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,580
One is called vision and the other is called hearing

932
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,580
right

933
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:07,080
Then the vision comes in and goes to the short-term memory of the vision

934
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,280
When hearing comes in, it goes to auditory short-term memory

935
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,780
These two signals must interact

936
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,780
an interaction

937
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,780
Then if after the interaction

938
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,280
you'll put the result in long-term memory

939
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,780
then you write something

940
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,280
but we are not now

941
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,780
Look at our multimedia

942
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,060
That you look doesn't match your voice

943
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,560
The two have no way to interact

944
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,560
At the same time you are viewing too much data at the same time

945
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,560
There are animations, texts, and pictures

946
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,560
The same picture is presented for you to see

947
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,560
So that all caused serious after-effects.

948
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,560
really all distractions

949
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,560
You can do experiments when you go back.

950
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,560
This multimedia experiment is scary

951
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,560
For example, if you drive a car, one day you will be able to drive

952
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,560
we have men who can drive

953
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,560
Then you ask your wife to fish for you by the side

954
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,560
How much did the stock drop today?

955
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,560
I don't believe traffic will be safe

956
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
Thanks

957
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,760
disturbed

958
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,340
because you see

959
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,860
road condition

960
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,160
inconsistent with what your wife said

961
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,440
right

962
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,480
there will be problems

963
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,040
Let's squeeze another example why we punish students

964
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,120
Now when students are punished, they are often accused, right? I just learned

965
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,680
Why do you punish students for moving around and the defendant is sometimes sued by parents and children

966
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,740
Is it true that the private relationship has not been done well?

967
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,580
So it's very simple to punish students, don't scold him, don't beat him

968
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,360
I will change Mr. Hu

969
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,420
Strong and bad all in white

970
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,260
Right? Then the student stood there and all he saw was white.

971
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,560
Then you just sit in front and give him two hours

972
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,620
I can't see the skinny

973
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,680
Right? What he saw was completely inconsistent with what he heard.

974
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,740
what's the use of hitting him

975
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,800
Because you beat a student, he is young and he can recover easily

976
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,640
Right? Then you are older, your cells after beating him

977
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,660
and easy

978
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,680
lost

979
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,480
Then your students are all recovered

980
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,020
so you just don't

981
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,340
I'll just find a room called Fukushima City

982
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,860
Do not stick anything on the long arm

983
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,500
Give him 70% white

984
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
But what he saw was a white wall

985
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Then you talk to him about the things he's least interested in.

986
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,000
After talking to him for an hour and two hours

987
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
His ears create a cognitive load

988
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That's serious. You can try it when you go back.

989
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So parents can do the same

990
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
we have kids, right?

991
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,500
you teach your parents

992
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
make a kitchen with you

993
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
guaranteed to be fun

994
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,000
So there are really many tools that can be researched here.

995
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,500
really a lot

996
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,500
One piece of information you can explore is a lot

997
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,500
I remember my son is very old now

998
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,000
we come back as soldiers

999
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I remember when he was in elementary school

1000
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,500
The elementary school was just doing that new dish

1001
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,000
To see what's new

1002
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So to practice new disk

1003
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Then we know that living in Taipei City

1004
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
can you see the stars at night

1005
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,500
can't see it

1006
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,500
so i remember

1007
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,500
to do his homework

1008
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,500
Then drive to that farm road in Keelung

1009
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,500
Isn't there a farm road by the sea in Keelung?

1010
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
farm road and then

1011
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,880
Use the horoscope chart with him to see various constellations

1012
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,420
various constellations

1013
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,000
After reading it, you must go at night

1014
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,200
So when I got home, it was like 3 or 4 o'clock

1015
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,360
I really want to sleep like this

1016
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,720
As a result, my son woke me up at 7 o'clock in the morning

1017
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,120
his dad sucks shit what...what did i say shit

1018
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,120
This is a constellation in the northern hemisphere, what about the southern hemisphere?

1019
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
i just want

1020
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,320
What is the best teaching? Contextualized teaching?

1021
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,380
Right, go directly to the scene?

1022
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,040
But how did you get to the southern hemisphere?

1023
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,720
It's hard, isn't it?

1024
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,380
So sometimes the textbook is really badly designed, right?

1025
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,880
You can teach the northern hemisphere, but you are still teaching the southern hemisphere

1026
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,580
And our parents don't know what to do

1027
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,380
It's even more hateful. What kind of course is there?

1028
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,180
Then watch the volcano explode.

1029
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,780
Watching volcanic explosions, you need situational teaching

1030
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,380
don't know how...how to teach

1031
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,880
Why...why can't you take him to the next seat to have a look?

1032
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,380
So sometimes our situational teaching is

1033
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,880
very good...both good teaching effect

1034
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,880
but often not feasible

1035
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Of course not feasible

1036
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Like I know you are in elementary school and junior high school

1037
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
When you were in junior high school, did you observe your karma when you were in elementary school?

1038
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Is there, is there, right?

1039
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Every child must observe the karma

1040
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
But at that time everyone had neck problems

1041
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Just look up and look again, causing traffic problems again

1042
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
right? what should I do?

1043
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
But where can you find the karma for 365 days a year?

1044
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Are there any on the Internet? Yes, really.

1045
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
A karma simulation of 365 days during that period

1046
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
so many teachers find that site

1047
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Then give a lot of homework and ask them to analyze the changes in the entire karma

1048
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
This is the idea of ​​constructivism

1049
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
He doesn't tell you the answer

1050
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Tell you to look at various karma to find out some relationships

1051
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
So this is a lot, actually the human interface

1052
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Very helpful for contextualized communication

1053
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
very helpful that works well

1054
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
But I have a lot of opinions, every time I talk to some teachers

1055
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
They are not willing to accept my good words

1056
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,260
In fact, there are several examples

1057
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,860
We often teach children

1058
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,260
If you meet Shero

1059
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,560
How should it be, right?

1060
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,900
So the teacher will want to say on the blackboard

1061
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,500
when you meet the bad guys or the club

1062
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,860
what do you want first

1063
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,800
what about the second one

1064
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,560
What about the third one?

1065
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,300
Is it like this

1066
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,000
But really, if one day we meet

1067
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,060
what will happen to this student

1068
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,400
nothing can happen

1069
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,960
Because he cuts out the chance to practice

1070
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,200
right

1071
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,360
But is this kind of practice possible for him?

1072
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:26,960
no way

1073
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,000
how can you get these people to practice

1074
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,400
Come back after practicing once

1075
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,000
So I talked to many

1076
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,800
The middle school sex director said

1077
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,760
Isn't our school building a lot of nature trails?

1078
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,460
the learning trail

1079
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,160
Just as I said, why don't you make a club

1080
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,000
Then let the general

1081
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,160
Let the sex director play the role of the club man

1082
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,360
Give students the opportunity to practice

1083
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:47,900
right

1084
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,860
How good is it to achieve the purpose of situational teaching

1085
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,460
But they don't seem to want

1086
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,360
stay away from my opinion

1087
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,960
I think I'm still strong

1088
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,060
this opinion is good

1089
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,260
But they are not willing to accept

1090
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:57,960
very strange

1091
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,920
I said, then you take turns to do it.

1092
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,600
Don't trust the old director every time, right?

1093
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,800
You Lutheran Lord can do it too.

1094
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,400
there is another

1095
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,800
Learning without Hu Shou

1096
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,800
This study without Hu Shou is a

1097
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,900
Future development because we learn from the effectiveness

1098
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,600
There are probably formal learning and informal learning

1099
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,000
A kind of learning like school belongs to formal learning

1100
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,200
But informal learning is like a museum

1101
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,800
Moreover, in our general learning environment,

1102
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,800
about seventy or eighty percent

1103
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,800
It's all about informal learning

1104
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,300
will formally learn about

1105
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,700
But I will study formally

1106
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,000
For example, if you go to a museum to visit

1107
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,600
can you really learn about all the artifacts in the museum

1108
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,300
can you help me

1109
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,400
So what do we often do

1110
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,400
Will find a guide's energy to assist us, right?

1111
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,200
action learning now

1112
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,000
This has its advantage

1113
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,900
Have it to bring your navigating energy to you

1114
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,500
bring you

1115
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,600
I bring you to deal with

1116
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,000
that same same

1117
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,580
Like that learning walk, I often say that there are many learning walks in schools now

1118
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,460
The learning trail can also be used as a mobility vehicle

1119
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,080
integrated into the learning trail

1120
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,360
you got somewhere

1121
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,700
He will show you some relevant information

1122
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,700
Now in many elementary schools

1123
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,700
Isn't there an outdoor teaching association?

1124
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,200
Doesn't the Outdoor Education Association have a study list? Right?

1125
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,200
In the study sheet, there is a principle in the design of the study sheet

1126
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,000
He hopes that through the topics in the worksheet

1127
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,500
To guide you to explore some information on the site

1128
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,300
Explore some plants in your outdoor teaching association as well

1129
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,500
animals too , i hope you explore

1130
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,000
So the design of that topic is very important

1131
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
but in this whole

1132
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,800
in the process of exploring

1133
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,800
For example, you read a page

1134
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,800
If the student doesn't understand, he doesn't understand

1135
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,300
Because there are no information stations hidden in this page

1136
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,300
Can you understand what I mean? The page you read is just a page

1137
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:59,300
Does it have any information in it?

1138
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,760
What if you go through a mobile vehicle

1139
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,720
situational awareness

1140
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,600
What does situational awareness mean?

1141
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,440
when it gets there it will

1142
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,880
Survive to sense

1143
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,720
After sensing it, it will take you this

1144
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,960
Information about this leaf

1145
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,760
will show up on your screen

1146
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,320
just provide some additional information

1147
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,960
additional information to help

1148
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,920
So something like this

1149
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,400
So it is very suitable for use in informal learning

1150
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,520
Also in formal learning

1151
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,760
also a very important

1152
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,040
in trading theory

1153
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,240
inside the trading theory

1154
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,720
Our Hirara

1155
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,320
There are two types of Hira

1156
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,800
one called

1157
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,880
One type of formation Taira

1158
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,000
summative level

1159
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,520
What does formative goodness mean?

1160
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,240
that is

1161
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,280
I hope that after this formative Hira

1162
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,160
Know what your current study status is

1163
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,120
Then according to your study status

1164
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,440
I will do remedial teaching

1165
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,080
I am formative Hirao

1166
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,080
That summative level

1167
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,600
So it’s because the pedestrian Xingping Liang is a very important role for half a year

1168
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,900
But we're almost in a classroom in Taiwan

1169
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,100
Hirao

1170
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,100
why? we have a lot of quizzes

1171
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,600
Right? But after the quiz

1172
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:18,400
Does any teacher have time to read the results of the quiz

1173
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,100
Then judge which concept in the previous class is not understood

1174
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,600
He can only do well in the previous class

1175
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,600
What is your average grade?

1176
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,200
He has no way to judge which concept in the previous class is not understood

1177
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,700
Because the teacher has no time

1178
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,200
So we only have quizzes

1179
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,000
We take the quiz as a summative level

1180
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,700
so in the classroom

1181
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:41,100
If people, teachers, real people

1182
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,500
With the teaching mode like this with students

1183
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,000
There is probably no way to be a pedestrian

1184
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,500
That is to say, there is almost no way for the teacher to know

1185
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,200
Which classmate or most of the classmates in the previous class

1186
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,000
which idea is not understood

1187
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,500
There's almost no way I can be pedestrian

1188
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,600
there is almost no way i can do it

1189
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,100
that's an important part

1190
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,500
Then this mobile vehicle can do that

1191
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,000
because it can drop the title where

1192
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Throw it into every man's mobile vehicle

1193
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
students can answer

1194
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Immediately after answering, collect them all

1195
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Can do data processing

1196
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
can judge immediately

1197
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Which idea does the student not understand

1198
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
you will fix it next time

1199
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
do remedial this instructable

1200
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
like this

1201
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So this place can improve us a kind

1202
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
A practice of Comoron Forest

1203
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
like a museum is not real

1204
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
when you visit a museum

1205
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
For example, we sometimes receive this

1206
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
What is the characteristic of this management

1207
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
which dynasty

1208
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And what kind of special love story is there on his front?

1209
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But one of the most important features of this management

1210
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
is behind

1211
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Do we now have a master that will automatically

1212
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
turn around to show you

1213
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Won't

1214
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
right

1215
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So you pass through the mobile vehicle

1216
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
information behind

1217
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
render it into your vehicle

1218
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
So a kind of mobility vehicle

1219
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,020
action learning

1220
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,840
A very important part of this part is

1221
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,000
human muscle

1222
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:06,900
skin

1223
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,200
on the actual situation

1224
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,760
The interaction of the three brings it together

1225
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,040
integrate it

1226
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,560
this is the hardest part

1227
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,100
from a transactional point of view

1228
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,900
How do we muscle people

1229
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,440
The three put it together

1230
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,220
it's difficult

1231
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,780
How are you framing this transaction scenario?

1232
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,840
so this place will

1233
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,120
there is another one

1234
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:32,520
Hu Shou is not in a learning digital content communication strategy and Pingliang method will change

1235
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,080
because your screen is not big

1236
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,160
right so you can render the content at the same time

1237
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,180
is limited

1238
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,760
so how do you find effective content and present it

1239
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,560
this is very complicated

1240
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,600
there is another

1241
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,640
A very important one like our Pingliang

1242
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,200
There is a kind of Pingliang called Situation Pingliang

1243
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,520
What is Pingjing Pingliang? For example, we

1244
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:54,280
us

1245
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,000
go to the entrance

1246
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,020
right

1247
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,060
Don't you need a driver's license to drive?

1248
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,600
driver's license you need to go to the entrance

1249
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,760
The entrance test is that you actually go into the situation and then take the test.

1250
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,720
You can judge after that

1251
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,680
This is called a good situation

1252
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,800
In this peaceful environment

1253
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,000
It is impossible to do it in a real educational environment.

1254
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,520
So how do you get through this mobility vehicle

1255
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,280
Achieving a goal of peace of mind

1256
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,560
so hard to do

1257
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,520
I actually don't have many standard answers for this part

1258
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,800
I'm all constantly

1259
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,040
I'll go and find out

1260
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,680
I do a find out what exactly is

1261
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,160
what should be done better

1262
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,080
Then there is another one

1263
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,600
Then how do I evaluate his learning effect?

1264
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,600
And he applied the whole process

1265
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,000
did you record it for me

1266
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,120
Also the design of your entire event

1267
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,760
Learning in action throughout

1268
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,080
Design of the whole event

1269
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,680
The result of this design

1270
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,080
How do you evaluate whether he is good or not?

1271
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,520
i evaluate him

1272
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,160
he is right or wrong

1273
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,640
Then assess whether he is motivated to learn?

1274
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:51,680
right

1275
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,440
a situation like this

1276
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,240
Don't think that sometimes mobile vehicle design is too fun

1277
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,000
Strong motivation to learn

1278
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,160
but his learning motivation

1279
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,040
Where are you so strong? So strong because this loading technique is fun

1280
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,040
not your content is fun

1281
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,040
So your final learning effect is not good

1282
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,540
Therefore, being motivated to learn does not mean that there is a learning effect.

1283
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,700
Because your loading skills are so interesting

1284
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,700
like gamified learning

1285
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,700
right?

1286
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,700
Gamified learning is done well

1287
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,200
is really hard to do

1288
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,700
You have both the function of the game and the effect of learning

1289
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,000
really hard to do

1290
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I've only seen one so far and probably nothing else.

1291
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
We all play games now, right? It’s fun, isn’t it?

1292
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
But there is no learning effect

1293
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Therefore, learning is a kind of learning software design based on games.

1294
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
is hard to design

1295
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
is hard to design

1296
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Well, but if your design is successful

1297
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
that would be a big deal

1298
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
We know that there are many kinds of nurturing

1299
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
It is difficult to develop a

1300
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
We make it a value development

1301
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
develop an attitude

1302
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
is hard

1303
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Everyone has different values

1304
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
So you're going to change a person's politics

1305
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
a political or religious belief

1306
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
is hard

1307
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Sometimes education is not enough

1308
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
so it's hard for you to change it

1309
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I remember

1310
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
a few years ago, about ten years ago, ten years ago

1311
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
there was a survey

1312
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Investigation seems to be idol pair

1313
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
A Survey of Human Idols

1314
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
As a result, the politicians came to the back

1315
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Who is the number one, do you know?

1316
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Cao Cao

1317
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Why is Cao Cao ranked first?

1318
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Because at that time there was a game software

1319
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
About the game software of Romance of the Three Kingdoms

1320
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
very smart

1321
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
and he's cosplaying

1322
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
you can play cao cao

1323
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Play Liu Bei and play anything

1324
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
As a result, he changed one of his ideas

1325
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
change his attitude

1326
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
so it's hard

1327
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Being able to design this kind of game can make money

1328
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
another change of mind

1329
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
is also very difficult

1330
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
To change a concept through which place

1331
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
cooperative game

1332
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,500
So I work with a group of people through cooperation

1333
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,500
to solve a certain difficulty of the game

1334
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,500
that might change your values

1335
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,500
So the interaction between people is very important

1336
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,500
you teach honestly

1337
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,500
to try to change his political stance

1338
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,500
try to change his religion

1339
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,500
it's actually hard

1340
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,000
But if a body

1341
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,500
It is possible to change after a long time

1342
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,500
so this place

1343
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,000
So this part of the evaluation method is difficult to do

1344
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,500
Now our general education assessment method

1345
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,500
probably several

1346
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,500
Generally, there are quantitative methods and value analysis

1347
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,000
Quantitative method, we use experimental group, control group, etc.

1348
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
then compare

1349
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
The value analysis we have to do

1350
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
take a picture of its information

1351
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
We'll do tape analysis after the filming

1352
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
tape analysis

1353
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,500
See how his behavior changes

1354
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,500
this can be done

1355
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,000
Now there is old science

1356
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
an application to education

1357
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
also doing

1358
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,500
But the question is now what

1359
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,500
This action learning is

1360
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,500
I don't know where the students go

1361
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,080
Like we used to do action learning in museums

1362
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,340
that's hard work

1363
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,120
First

1364
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,660
Because they are all elementary school students

1365
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,480
So we're afraid he'll drop our tablet on the ground

1366
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,040
We can't blame him for falling into the ground and ruining it.

1367
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,600
So we specially designed a bag to drop here

1368
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,920
Let him stay like this even if he falls

1369
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,200
fall over there

1370
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,000
but we have to collect him

1371
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,040
collect his information

1372
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,360
Is that right? Collect his information and write that we sometimes don’t know each other.

1373
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,440
So I had to make another hat, this is student No. 1, student No. 2

1374
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,740
make lots of hats for them to put on their heads

1375
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,800
Then we start designing

1376
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:34,820
design

1377
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,860
But sometimes they talk

1378
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,660
I can't hear the discussion sometimes.

1379
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,680
so again

1380
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,240
Are you going to use that hidden microphone again?

1381
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,820
Because I can't let them know that there is a microphone

1382
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,620
they started not to speak

1383
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,160
hidden microphone

1384
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,960
But I want to see the expression on his face

1385
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,780
So I had to add one to the mobile vehicle

1386
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:55,540
CAMERA

1387
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,580
I design

1388
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,600
so complicated

1389
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,600
It was hard work, it was hard work to do that experiment.

1390
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
spend a lot of money

1391
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,440
But this way of evaluating

1392
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,400
indeed in action

1393
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,240
ubiquitous learning inside

1394
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,840
is a complicated part

1395
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,640
It is also necessary to conduct a discussion

1396
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,600
In addition, there is a digital content application guide

1397
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,320
The first online learning resource

1398
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,080
This learning resource is very important

1399
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,920
For example, the current simulation software

1400
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:26,040
We put a lot of abstract things

1401
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,440
Design through simulation software

1402
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,040
simulate on the computer

1403
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,200
electric second wave

1404
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,840
And the learning simulation has an important part

1405
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,280
The simulation of the game is different

1406
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,560
Like many gamification software nowadays, it is simulation

1407
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,880
you become a mayor

1408
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,160
or you are a government

1409
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,240
then how do you build a city

1410
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,000
So that software is complicated

1411
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,400
The software we trade with is not that complicated

1412
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,080
Why? Because I just talked about the concept of scaffolding

1413
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,960
That is to say I can start from the simple pattern

1414
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,200
tell you the result

1415
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,040
Then slowly add the complex

1416
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,420
So we don't start by putting the most complex situation in

1417
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:07,760
Instead, gradually add complexity

1418
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,060
So the simulation is a simplified simulation of

1419
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,920
Sometimes it works better

1420
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,600
If game software it's full emulation

1421
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,000
sometimes it doesn't work

1422
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,120
So there's just too much to do in one design

1423
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,500
There is too much of a learning karma

1424
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:30,460
Now Silverside itself is your learning software

1425
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,460
put your resources on

1426
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,160
Is there any change in the part of your presentation?

1427
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:39,500
How to manage this place effectively

1428
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,660
Then how to do an effective presentation

1429
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:44,260
In addition, in the wireless network

1430
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,660
In the case of a mobile carrier

1431
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:50,660
Can these learning contents be cross-platform?

1432
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,000
Something like this has to be dealt with

1433
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,200
Then this one is and the other one is information technology

1434
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,000
Integrate into teaching and learning

1435
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
this part

1436
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
we have less time

1437
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
But it's an important place

1438
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Well, Taiwan has implemented it for more than ten years.

1439
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So teachers have many ways to use

1440
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Intellectual Technology In fact, all tools can do

1441
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
all tools can do

1442
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
For example, you can teach simple statistics with Xare

1443
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
teachers can use

1444
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I just remember a teacher who was very good at them

1445
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Teaching for him to teach statistics

1446
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
teach students statistics and then

1447
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Then he started to design

1448
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
he's the first he wants to get motivated

1449
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
How does he arouse motivation? He puts a lot of information

1450
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Messy and show on PowerPoint

1451
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Then ask the students, what is the relationship between these numbers?

1452
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
That student must not understand

1453
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I don't know what's the matter

1454
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
He said that I will change the mode for you

1455
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
and then after clicking

1456
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
After pressing it, the numbers will start to run slowly

1457
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Run into a statistical result

1458
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,160
Then you say what's the relationship

1459
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,240
written achievement is very clear

1460
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,360
he just for motivation

1461
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,160
For students interested in statistics

1462
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,720
He does such a treatment

1463
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,600
There is another one who doesn't know there are children here

1464
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,760
I don't know if I should talk

1465
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,480
Then don't take me as the principal of the Normal University

1466
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,960
it caused me to talk about the professor

1467
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,360
Because the president of the normal university sometimes

1468
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,360
more responsibilities

1469
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,400
This is actually the problem

1470
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,600
In fact, there are teachers who teach

1471
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,560
don't we have sex education

1472
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:32,840
right

1473
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,240
How about sex education

1474
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,520
And he's talking about animal sex

1475
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,400
I don't know why there is such a class

1476
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,880
It's really the teacher who teaches like this

1477
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,240
how does he do you know

1478
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,640
He was just at that time

1479
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,520
Discovery

1480
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,400
He has a company for his videos

1481
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,240
Buy the rights to Discovery

1482
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,960
That copyright can be picked up segment by segment

1483
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,600
It's not the whole film, it's picked up piece by piece

1484
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,040
then put it on the web

1485
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Then he put the sexual behavior of animals in Discover

1486
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Then hand it over to sketch in class

1487
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Let Sketchbook understand this essay question

1488
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Then you say there is no video, how can we teach it?

1489
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
There is no way to actually operate it.

1490
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Right, it’s hard, right, it’s really hard

1491
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
But there is such a course

1492
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
But I saw that he was very natural after teaching.

1493
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
very natural

1494
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Therefore, in fact, many media

1495
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Always felt a need to have a lot to teach

1496
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
but very embarrassing

1497
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
But after going through the media, it became normal

1498
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
become normal, something like this

1499
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So the teacher will also do this

1500
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
so they can find many

1501
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I also saw a teacher

1502
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I've asked many people what to do

1503
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
There was an earthquake at that time, right?

1504
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
He's going to teach that tremor

1505
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
How strong is the vibration of your earthquake?

1506
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
he did it for the first time

1507
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
How about the earthquake in the first episode, it's moving on the screen

1508
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
How did you move in the first episode? How did you move in the second episode? Move even more

1509
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,000
By the end of the episode, the screen broke

1510
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
If you want to move until it breaks, you have to simulate it completely

1511
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
It must be simulated completely. There is also such a method

1512
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
So this is very interesting, and in fact our domestic

1513
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Teacher Zhuang Xiaoyi's ability in this area is usually pretty good

1514
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Our teacher is quite serious

1515
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
just because it's a pity

1516
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Most of this is done by elementary school teachers.

1517
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Because he doesn't have the entrance exam pressure, he doesn't have the entrance exam

1518
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I also saw an example

1519
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
a music teacher

1520
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
because he was going to teach that

1521
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
It seems that the elementary school plays the flute or the tendons

1522
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
But every time I play the flute

1523
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Because the piano teacher needs an accompaniment, right?

1524
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Only the body of the shoe can play the flute

1525
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
But he said that every time we were playing the accompaniment

1526
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I really do not know

1527
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,640
How about the students blowing

1528
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,200
He really doesn't know because he's playing the accompaniment

1529
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,480
But then it was very simple, he just used a computer

1530
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,000
Then he asked the computer to do the accompaniment

1531
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:13,320
So the computer is playing the accompaniment and he listens to it one by one

1532
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,260
So the computer becomes his assistant

1533
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,660
My assistant went to play the accompaniment and he listened to them one by one

1534
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:22,560
How about blowing the bottom? It's a music teacher's job.

1535
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,520
So in other words, there are actually a lot of creative ways

1536
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,160
It actually exists in our teaching environment

1537
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,920
It's also quite a conscious approach.

1538
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:35,360
I used to teach calligraphy. Our Dean Wang Hu is a calligrapher.

1539
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:40,120
I heard that calligraphy must be the first to draw red

1540
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,080
step by step

1541
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,080
That teacher, he is very good

1542
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:49,080
He wrote it himself first and then asked someone to take a picture of it

1543
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,120
After shooting, in that step

1544
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:52,880
he put it

1545
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,760
play it out

1546
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,160
he uses media play

1547
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,080
Then media play can repeat

1548
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,000
So the same comparison he kept

1549
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,500
My fart let the students watch

1550
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,260
I let the students see how he wrote

1551
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,860
I keep showing him

1552
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:06,640
If you were to teach yourself how

1553
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,760
i remember when i was young

1554
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,960
The teacher taught us to write with a brush, right?

1555
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,140
a soul pen and draw again

1556
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,840
that can't be done at all

1557
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,640
So there are also teachers who do it specially.

1558
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,740
So this is an auxiliary tool and it is also very effective.

1559
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:25,240
There is also a kind of university

1560
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,900
Especially now that the general education courses in universities

1561
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,460
Because Taiwan really does not have a kind of university

1562
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,460
It is a truly neutral university

1563
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,860
I often say that it is a transfer to a neutral university

1564
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:38,100
For example, National Taiwan University does not have music and fine arts

1565
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:41,200
Normal University has no business

1566
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,360
But your general education, especially the current future development

1567
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,100
General education courses are increasingly important

1568
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:52,360
We often say that we will have cultural and creative industries in the future

1569
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:52,900
right

1570
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,060
But cultural and creative industries

1571
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,460
I often tell the professors in our music department

1572
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,460
I said every time I go to a concert

1573
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:00,460
Looking forward to gas is to understand the concert

1574
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I said, can you help us find a solution?

1575
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
People like me who don't understand music are willing to spend money

1576
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Come and listen to your symphony industry

1577
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Come and listen to your pipe business, right?

1578
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
You have to find a way to create a market

1579
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Your market will expand

1580
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Also you have to cultivate an existing culture

1581
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
creative industries, the industry

1582
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
you must have a market then you must have a market

1583
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
So you have to be in the colleague transaction

1584
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Let's improve our cultural literacy, right?

1585
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
In the future, the things we design will look like LV

1586
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Everyone at least we expand

1587
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
So we have to pay mainland cultural literacy

1588
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Why because it's important after we put it together

1589
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Its market is huge, right? We don't want to wait for a professional

1590
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
But we develop our colleagues so that it knows it's literate

1591
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
it has musicality

1592
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
So I often talk to some of our music department teachers and folklore

1593
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Because the Music Folklore of Normal University

1594
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Every time it is the first industry in the country

1595
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Then every time our other students

1596
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
going to his class next to him

1597
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
or take his class

1598
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
they all season

1599
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I said why is it like this?

1600
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I said you can't open a music app

1601
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
drive more

1602
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
let these students

1603
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Everyone knows how to appreciate music

1604
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Isn't your market bigger?

1605
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
right

1606
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Are you still afraid that your major will be expected by others?

1607
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
impossible things

1608
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Because you are in the last four years

1609
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
They hurry up for a year or two

1610
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
so the euphoria amplifies it

1611
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
the market will be bigger

1612
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
As a result I think we are now

1613
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
The one watching the art exhibition

1614
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
not those buyers to see

1615
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Then just know how to draw

1616
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
As far as people in the art world look at each other

1617
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
look at each other

1618
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
then the music is all

1619
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Those who know music should listen

1620
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Listen to Jay Chou for everything else

1621
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
this feels bad

1622
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
all bad

1623
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Then this should be an exhibition

1624
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
do it complementary

1625
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Here is a very important thing to say

1626
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Teaching and learning theories throughout digital learning

1627
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
and a development of strategy and evaluation

1628
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I just talked about the issue of education

1629
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
It's been a hundred years

1630
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
But it creates this problem

1631
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
It is all in the process of interaction between people

1632
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
developed it

1633
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
But once information technology comes in

1634
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
some of it affects education

1635
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Whether it's the sequelae

1636
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
or a change in its learning strategy

1637
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
will have an impact

1638
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
On this side, we need to conduct a new discussion

1639
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
So this is the difficulty and here

1640
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
So why start putting a lot of

1641
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
brain science wait to put it in

1642
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
just to understand

1643
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
With the intervention of such technology

1644
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Is there any other theory we want to develop

1645
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
This is also a difficult part

1646
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
How to do it from a cognitive point of view

1647
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
How to understand how its brain changes

1648
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,300
There is a process, how does the process work

1649
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,900
So this place is worth exploring

1650
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:09,460
What about his sequelae, what sequelae do you have?

1651
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:11,640
In fact, I often tell many people

1652
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,920
In fact, computers are really fascinating

1653
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,060
Whether you are a mobile phone or a tablet computer

1654
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:19,980
Or a personal computer, both are fascinating

1655
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:23,780
But because he's charming, it's easy to get lost

1656
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:26,500
Because he has too many sequelae that will cause

1657
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,460
But if you don't deal with it well, you will really get lost

1658
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,460
The impact might last a lifetime

1659
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,800
You can do your own experiments

1660
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,600
say you are above your office

1661
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,240
next to you if you use the computer a lot

1662
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,940
You use a computer next to you, so you study here

1663
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:45,740
I assure you that you will not concentrate on reading

1664
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:49,360
Because you run into your computer every 15 minutes

1665
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,020
Check if there is an email coming in

1666
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:54,040
See if anyone wants to chat with you on Facebook

1667
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,280
Is that right?

1668
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,600
You're mentally retarded, right?

1669
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,100
That's too much insurance

1670
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,640
but if you do well

1671
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,600
I teach parents a trick

1672
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,440
This is very important

1673
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,640
my wife did it

1674
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,840
because my son

1675
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:14,240
When I was from elementary school to middle school

1676
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,000
that summer vacation

1677
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,360
One day during that summer vacation, he said

1678
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,360
He wants to chat with his classmates

1679
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:24,360
This is not bad

1680
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,640
Since I just graduated, I want to chat with my classmates

1681
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,560
We thought you were a good kid

1682
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:29,320
Why

1683
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,720
Because before full of classmates

1684
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:33,880
it's time why don't you go out

1685
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,560
I can't figure it out

1686
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,880
It's time to come, why don't you go out and chat

1687
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,320
still at home

1688
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,680
Later I found out that their so-called chatting is online chatting

1689
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,200
I said is it that serious?

1690
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,400
Doesn't your classmate live next door to ours?

1691
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,000
also chat online

1692
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,560
He chats online every day

1693
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,800
strangeness

1694
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,560
Then we chatted for a while

1695
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,160
about two weeks later

1696
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:54,960
I am very impressed

1697
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,280
A girl from Hualing High School wrote a letter

1698
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,600
really write a letter

1699
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,200
Will being a parent be stressful?

1700
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:07,000
A girl who just graduated from elementary school and a girl from Hualien High School wrote to him

1701
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,300
I'm scared to death

1702
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,300
But that person is small

1703
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:12,100
So use half of it to read his letter

1704
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:15,000
I always let us think about it halfway and I see his letter

1705
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,600
Fortunately, there is no problem

1706
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:17,900
I am more at ease

1707
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,200
but how many parents do things

1708
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,500
because of this

1709
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,000
so i won't let you go online

1710
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,700
blocked you

1711
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:25,600
right

1712
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,200
I want to block more seriously sometimes

1713
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,300
because where will he go

1714
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,600
he went to internet cafe

1715
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,700
Internet cafes were very popular back then, right?

1716
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:32,900
that's not more serious

1717
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,100
then what should we do

1718
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,800
There are several strategies to do

1719
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:36,500
First

1720
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,400
if the child was young

1721
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,300
You put all your computers in a shared place

1722
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,400
in the study

1723
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:43,800
in the study

1724
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,300
If he surfs the Internet for a long time, you walk around next to him

1725
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,200
Make him uncomfortable online

1726
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:49,900
my first

1727
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,900
The second is because Yahoo didn’t need money back then.

1728
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,700
so my wife because my wife is a fast typer

1729
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,900
He went online to apply for an account

1730
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,400
then he does role play

1731
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,600
He chatted with my son online

1732
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,640
Then half a year is his

1733
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,280
classmate's

1734
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:09,840
your classmate

1735
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,720
that's good that's really useful

1736
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,840
When he passed the exam, he went online to talk to him about it.

1737
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,980
My mom said that's what he was going to say

1738
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,400
My mother said because we want to take the exam

1739
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,800
So we have to work hard, what?

1740
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,840
He didn't know until college

1741
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,800
which girl is his mother

1742
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:28,800
hehe

1743
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,520
So it’s really good if you do well on the Internet, right?

1744
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,160
Existing tutoring function

1745
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,040
It depends on how you use it

1746
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,840
So everyone thinks that Xie Computer is also good

1747
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,520
It's good to type faster

1748
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,520
He always has this instrument, right?

1749
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,280
You can go tutor your own children

1750
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,960
similar to this

1751
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,520
But there are so many unknowns

1752
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,560
we really need to develop

1753
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,840
There are too many theories that are not yet known

1754
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:53,960
of course i don't know yet

1755
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,320
So I say that this field has an advantage that is to say

1756
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,960
can almost redo the problem of education

1757
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,240
platform change

1758
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I usually change

1759
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
So this is full

1760
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
In addition, the roles of teachers and agreements have changed

1761
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
This is the most impressive

1762
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I am a graduate student

1763
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
that graduate student

1764
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
He once I was looking for a software

1765
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I can't find it

1766
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
He said it's okay, teacher, I'll give it to you in a few days

1767
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
He really gave it to me in a few days

1768
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I wonder why he is so powerful

1769
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
why so powerful

1770
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
he can give me something right away

1771
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
he doesn't speak

1772
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Later it was hard

1773
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Then his information ability is much better than mine

1774
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Later he

1775
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
just graduated

1776
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
His cooperation told me teacher you know

1777
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
He is the stationmaster of the underground website outside

1778
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
So I actually have a student

1779
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
underground webmaster

1780
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
You can get me various software

1781
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
i feel weird

1782
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
what does this mean

1783
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
If we use this angle of information

1784
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I can't keep it up

1785
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Because his IT skills are much better than mine

1786
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
So I say a kind of teacher

1787
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
The role of university teachers needs to be changed

1788
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
What you want to teach him may not be direct knowledge

1789
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
It's the meta knowledge

1790
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
may become like this

1791
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
one change one big change

1792
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
there is another one

1793
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
He used to have an Altros at Central University

1794
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Then you can start classes on Altros

1795
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Then he later transferred Altros to Chunghwa Telecom

1796
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Turns out there is a very hot teacher

1797
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
That Besker I'm talking about is Chen Shiyuan

1798
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
very popular

1799
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Then I found out that the teacher

1800
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Is a student of the Central China Normal University

1801
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
do you know wes

1802
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
So on the Internet you will feel that

1803
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
You think he's great, maybe he's a teacher

1804
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
it could be me but what

1805
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
he can wes

1806
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
But in real environment

1807
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
he is your student

1808
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
So this role is a big change

1809
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
You know a lot about the roles of teachers and students

1810
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
In particular, the role of the teacher needs to change

1811
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
The role of the teacher what you are going to teach him

1812
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,220
may not be transfer of knowledge

1813
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:05,900
but another aspect

1814
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:06,900
my change

1815
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,840
what about the second one

1816
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,340
The way students learn also changes

1817
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:12,940
my way of learning

1818
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,980
The teacher may later become a facilitator

1819
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,420
He's also a no-talker

1820
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,380
Come up with a topic and guide

1821
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:19,180
guide

1822
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:20,420
one of our practices

1823
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:22,980
However, the perspective of students has also changed.

1824
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:25,260
Now there is a kind of interactive communication

1825
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,020
That is to say, we have always believed that

1826
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:29,020
If students can ask questions

1827
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:32,540
The student's understanding of knowledge is very high

1828
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,020
so often what happens

1829
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:34,620
meeting

1830
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:37,220
The student poses a question for another student to answer

1831
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,260
can you understand me

1832
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:40,460
I do this often

1833
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,300
The teacher-student perspective has changed

1834
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,860
But our traditional education is still a big problem

1835
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,100
You want our primary school teacher

1836
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,740
I think our elementary school teachers are really hardworking

1837
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:50,900
salary is not high

1838
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,540
a lot of working hours

1839
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:53,380
Why

1840
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:54,780
Change homework every time

1841
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:55,980
raw knowledge

1842
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,180
Do you have any impression

1843
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,040
If a word is wrong in the Ministry of Health and Intelligence

1844
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I have to write 30 times when I go home, right?

1845
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
The job of the teacher is to pick out the shortcomings of the students

1846
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
what's wrong where's wrong

1847
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Then the job is like this

1848
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
multiple choice

1849
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Clear choice

1850
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Then that answer is C

1851
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Choose A for sketching, right?

1852
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Then sketch must write CCC 3 times next to A

1853
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Is it this way

1854
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Isn't it strange that we teach you to speak

1855
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Then the calculation problem was wrong, right?

1856
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Then go back to timeout

1857
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Write that process 10 times

1858
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
How can this education improve

1859
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Because SASIS is still wrong

1860
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
We sketch the same word can be wrong

1861
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Maybe I'm still wrong until I'm 20

1862
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
why is this

1863
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
because you never gave him a chance to find fault

1864
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
So I often tell the teacher

1865
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
The first one, your salary is not high

1866
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Because I once gave a speech at an elementary school

1867
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
i was very angry

1868
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I'm speaking and I speak so well

1869
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
The bottom is changing homework

1870
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
you will be angry

1871
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I'm changing my homework the next day, right?

1872
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
ah you can blame them

1873
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Thinking about it later, it's really pathetic

1874
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
because we all asked him to

1875
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Look at the teacher in Anqing Class

1876
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Anqing class teacher

1877
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Is it his job only to do

1878
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Just change homework

1879
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
So let our students have a habit

1880
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
very bad habit

1881
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
we only have one thing to do

1882
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
but didn't do a thing well

1883
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Many of our graduate students are like this

1884
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Right? That's why I never help students.

1885
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I helped a student revise a paper once

1886
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I'm almost editing his composition

1887
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I'm so angry that I'm yours after all

1888
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Information teacher or your Chinese teacher?

1889
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Every time I have to help him change his composition

1890
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
That word, I found a typo

1891
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I'm always like this

1892
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
that's not right

1893
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
So it should be reversed

1894
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
In fact, our parents have to be patient.

1895
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
And teachers have to communicate with parents

1896
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
For example, find that typo

1897
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
why don't you look for it like this

1898
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
You just ask the students to find typos

1899
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
homework for students to go back on their own

1900
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,600
Just start by saying that there are two mistakes on this page

1901
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,600
go back and find it, right?

1902
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,600
Students go back and find it by themselves.

1903
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,800
The young age on that page, will you be able to find it the first time you look for it?

1904
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,800
Are you sure you won't find it?

1905
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,800
Because they never had that belief

1906
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,800
so he won't find

1907
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,000
what to do if you can't find it

1908
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
It doesn't matter if you come back. It's always okay.

1909
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,200
It doesn't matter if you can't find it on this page

1910
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,200
Then there is a typo in Shang Han.

1911
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:28,000
You just switch to zoom out, right?

1912
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,200
Go back and look for it, he will look for it from inside Shang Han

1913
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,400
What if you still can't find it?

1914
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,400
Then there is a typo in one line, right?

1915
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,600
What if you still can't find it?

1916
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,600
Is there a typo in the three words?

1917
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,800
one time you'll find

1918
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,400
But you also develop an opportunity for him to self-diagnose

1919
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,200
right, you said that math

1920
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:49,200
That counting error in how many students we have is a miscalculation

1921
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,400
But what will they know later that he miscalculated

1922
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:56,000
If you let them find the wrong reason every time

1923
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,400
They make a typo every time because I miscalculated

1924
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,000
I tell you after the current events he will

1925
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Will there be any more miscalculations?

1926
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:03,780
because he'll know he's miscalculated every time he's wrong

1927
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,020
right like this

1928
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:08,280
The same is true for composition changes, because every time students

1929
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,020
It’s very hard for the teacher to correct them. Of course, you can help him correct a few articles.

1930
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:14,280
Because you have to comment, sometimes you can exchange and change the composition

1931
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,820
Let me tell you that we humans have a common problem

1932
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:19,780
I can’t even find my own fault, so I’m very accurate in finding someone else’s fault

1933
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:22,140
Right? After you exchange and change

1934
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:24,200
Let me tell you he picks faults very well

1935
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,580
Right, it's ok after changing it a few times

1936
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:29,320
This human really needs to be cultivated but almost none of us have

1937
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,640
How can I do this kind of training with a computer?

1938
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:33,920
right

1939
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,760
The computer itself is to create an environment

1940
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,640
But this environment is always in use

1941
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,440
It is an environment that helps students learn

1942
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,560
Rather than expecting students to learn

1943
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,720
So one of this part

1944
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,480
because how did i jump here

1945
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,040
I was just here

1946
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,680
Therefore, the roles of teachers and students are sometimes

1947
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,920
Adjust it. When I am a teacher, I often

1948
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,640
Then the salary is not very high, each salary increase is only 3%

1949
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,320
as little as he does that doesn't have to work

1950
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,860
Too responsible teachers sometimes create irresponsible students

1951
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:09,360
This, the evaluation of the effectiveness method

1952
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,360
This, this at present, before Ye Lai

1953
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,180
bright marriage salary, or straight marriage salary

1954
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:17,520
Now it's mass blending together to do

1955
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,560
And then put brain science into it

1956
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,060
So this kind of marriage salary model is more and more, more and more development

1957
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:26,660
even through videotape

1958
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:29,160
After you shoot the videotape, then

1959
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,660
Then describe its learning status

1960
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:34,380
Which learning state would you jump from this learning state to?

1961
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:37,360
Then jump from this learning state to which angle, and then evaluate

1962
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,360
Is there a significant difference from this state to this state?

1963
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,860
I use statistics, so I will put the statistics

1964
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:45,640
Integrate with that straight marriage salary

1965
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:49,900
Liang and Zhi will integrate it together, so this is a more and more scientific approach

1966
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,120
Okay, so this is the part about information literacy

1967
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:57,480
This has probably been mentioned just now, the first digit gap

1968
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,140
This number is far behind Taiwan

1969
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,200
So far so good, but there are some problems

1970
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:06,200
In recent years, the situation of digital gap has indeed been

1971
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,700
That is to say, your symbiosis in the north

1972
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,700
Is it similar to the South's symbiosis information capability?

1973
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,700
Now it's not a digital gap

1974
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:15,200
Now we in Taiwan don't seem to be

1975
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,200
Like Yinyin gap, math gap

1976
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,700
It seems that there are all kinds of gaps

1977
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,700
Yes, it's getting worse

1978
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:22,700
The gap in that part is getting worse

1979
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:23,700
this is

1980
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:27,700
It has indeed improved a lot in recent years.

1981
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,700
Of course there is one more

1982
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,700
How do you detect this gap?

1983
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,100
how do you define

1984
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:35,100
The so-called digital gap

1985
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:36,300
Digital gap

1986
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,900
how do you detect it

1987
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,900
And then react very quickly

1988
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:42,900
On the contrary, this mechanism is not easy to do.

1989
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,900
How do you define what is called drop

1990
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:45,900
Then in this gap

1991
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,900
A print that can be accessed through the Internet

1992
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,400
and react anytime

1993
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,900
How much has the situation of its gap changed?

1994
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:55,900
So this should be dealt with by the government

1995
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:57,900
Additional Internet Literacy Section

1996
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,900
It has probably been said just now

1997
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,120
Now Internet literacy does not mean that you understand the principles of the Internet

1998
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:09,080
For example, 70% of your network has a network protocol

1999
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,880
That kind of agreement is not about that

2000
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,680
That's a professional doing it

2001
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:15,760
But where is the quality of a non-professional person?

2002
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,920
So are we going to redefine it?

2003
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,360
And now different technology comes in

2004
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,840
Various technologies come in

2005
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:26,080
Is that a form of your problem solving?

2006
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,280
will also change

2007
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,720
like this

2008
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,960
this is

2009
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,000
That's the hardest thing to do right now

2010
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,760
I'm still working on a very interesting topic

2011
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:37,840
We call it presence

2012
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,040
presence

2013
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:39,960
For example we do

2014
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,920
Now everyone is very present, right?

2015
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,800
because we can talk to each other

2016
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,800
face to face

2017
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:46,840
But when on the Internet

2018
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,520
your teacher may be in taipei

2019
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,800
Then your business students may be all over the world

2020
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,800
His sense of presence is gone

2021
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,120
right

2022
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,480
What about the sense of presence?

2023
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,840
Then how do you improve the sense of presence?

2024
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,440
I'm in trouble now

2025
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,240
what is presence

2026
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
how do you define presence

2027
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
So a group of teachers are studying this

2028
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
specializing in how

2029
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Improving the sense of presence in the Internet age

2030
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Now I know like geoprotocol

2031
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
sense of place

2032
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I just recently developed a sense of place

2033
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
For example, if I go to Tamsui

2034
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
after freshwater

2035
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
what methods can i use to improve my sense of place in freshwater

2036
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
As far as I agree with Tamsui

2037
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
then what about me

2038
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
It has a definition out

2039
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I am very abstract

2040
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
start slowly materializing it

2041
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
slowly quantify it

2042
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
So this whole process

2043
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
The history I use is also currently in

2044
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
A discussion like this

2045
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
So when I used to be on the Internet

2046
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Problems that would not exist in the non-Internet era

2047
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
However, in the era of Internet in mainland China, there will be

2048
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
The topic of this study arises

2049
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
How can we discuss the sense of presence in education like before?

2050
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
No, because it's all natural

2051
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
want to be together

2052
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,180
But in the Internet age

2053
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:03,600
Presence becomes very important

2054
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,600
We want to improve our sense of presence

2055
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:06,600
right

2056
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:07,720
that...that...

2057
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,600
Well...motivation is also important

2058
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,200
for example

2059
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,700
how do i... how do i increase your motivation to study

2060
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:14,400
The learning motivation is only

2061
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:16,400
What is the motivation for learning for the first time?

2062
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,400
Still need magnetism for learning motivation

2063
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:19,500
right

2064
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,800
How to improve it

2065
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,100
i through the internet

2066
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:23,200
how can i raise it

2067
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,700
Because your individual study is very lonely

2068
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,900
because in the classroom

2069
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:28,900
you have companions

2070
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:30,400
but when online

2071
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,800
you are learning alone

2072
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,100
you are doing it yourself

2073
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,000
that's what you're doing

2074
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,700
How do you improve his learning motivation

2075
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,300
And this motive needs a magnet

2076
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:38,200
right

2077
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,600
so something like this one

2078
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,600
this question

2079
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,300
to discuss

2080
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:43,700
a part of him

2081
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:46,100
Of course, there are generally two motivations for learning.

2082
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,300
class motivation

2083
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,700
One is extrinsic motivation

2084
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,300
a class in an external

2085
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:51,600
that generally speaking

2086
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,300
small child

2087
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,300
Usually you need extrinsic motivation.

2088
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,600
So we also encourage the power system

2089
01:20:58,600 --> 01:20:59,700
must reconsider

2090
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
If there is progress, then you will give it to him

2091
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,560
give him a little gift

2092
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,000
This is outside winter

2093
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,360
We grown-ups too, why are you investing in stocks?

2094
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,120
Because there is winter outside, because you will make money

2095
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,360
Right, but when you often lose money

2096
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,880
So what to do, you have to study how to make money

2097
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,280
so you might look into that

2098
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:22,080
What technical analysis of what stock?

2099
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,280
But you may study to a certain stage

2100
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:25,560
you think he's funny

2101
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:28,000
Right? Not only can he help you make money, but he

2102
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,240
there is his smell

2103
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,840
Then change from external winter to internal winter

2104
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,480
Because you think it's interesting and you're willing to take over again

2105
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,840
So we are often motivated from the outside

2106
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,280
then switch to the inner

2107
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,000
So the initial motivation

2108
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,960
computerized a motive

2109
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,720
computer games or computer

2110
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,160
computer washing part

2111
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:49,000
just arouse your motivation first

2112
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,200
To arouse you through the external winter

2113
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,400
But slowly it will return to the inner winter

2114
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,360
otherwise he won't last

2115
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,440
won't last like this whole research journey

2116
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,680
Another very important

2117
01:21:59,680 --> 01:21:59,960
Now

2118
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,300
in the internet age

2119
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:03,620
A very important one is the sequelae of the Internet

2120
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,420
My sequelae are really big

2121
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:08,080
What is the sequelae?

2122
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:09,940
There's really something we don't know yet

2123
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:11,260
Then we still have to explore

2124
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:14,000
Now I only know that there are many people sitting in Internet cafes

2125
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:16,420
After sitting for a long time, the result is a stroke

2126
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,080
I'm all sequelae

2127
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:20,860
Then I just said that when you were next to a computer

2128
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:22,820
you sit on this side he will interfere with you

2129
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:23,820
right

2130
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:25,700
I have a lot of sequelae like this

2131
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:27,980
Is there any age difference

2132
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:29,780
For example, say you have reached a certain grade

2133
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:30,620
after age

2134
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:31,900
These side effects are gone

2135
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:35,220
disappear without form

2136
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:36,700
But you are below high school

2137
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:38,300
you like on facebook

2138
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,300
Like many adults don't like to go to Facebook these days

2139
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:41,380
right

2140
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:42,500
because feel

2141
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,620
There's no point in chatting with him online.

2142
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:47,420
But kids love it

2143
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:48,140
right

2144
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:50,060
So is there an effect of age?

2145
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:52,220
I have a discussion topic like this

2146
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:54,340
I'm worth it

2147
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:55,340
to study

2148
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:57,860
I specifically bring this up as

2149
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:59,300
Because of

2150
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
So we want to be able to

2151
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
And this can indeed improve

2152
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
motive for action

2153
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Increase ability to act

2154
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
So how should you design

2155
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
But gamification software

2156
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
If saving the game itself

2157
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
it also has side effects

2158
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
So this is a very difficult design

2159
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
so we call it

2160
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
serious game

2161
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
serious is a very serious game

2162
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
then you have a solution

2163
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
This is a contradiction, the game can still be very serious

2164
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
But the application of education is to be like this

2165
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
So this is a very complex

2166
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
a part, a development of a very complex part

2167
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Of course this is too

2168
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
worth exploring, because in fact

2169
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
it exists

2170
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
There is also this phenomenon

2171
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
So how do we put the game part

2172
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
import it into learning

2173
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
more normal use

2174
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
So there's a lot of the same

2175
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
its content design , its theory

2176
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
and evaluation of its strategy

2177
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
even its man-machine interface

2178
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
This tool needs to be discussed and developed

2179
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,840
It's a really difficult part

2180
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:09,000
Let's take a look at the part that is currently under development.

2181
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,000
i need to do it again

2182
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,320
What are the possible future scenarios?

2183
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,640
my first

2184
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,280
your future classroom

2185
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,000
future school etc.

2186
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:19,960
future learning style

2187
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,000
even future teachers

2188
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:24,680
I recently talked to our

2189
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,200
Our physical education teacher said

2190
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,720
I said we have so many players

2191
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:29,720
right

2192
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,640
So many players often compete outside

2193
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:36,000
Then how do we provide a good teaching model

2194
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:36,880
instead of saying

2195
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,400
Only for class or what kind of use

2196
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,280
Are there different ways of teaching

2197
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,200
Let these players learn more

2198
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,440
then his

2199
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,080
his grades are better

2200
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,200
And he's more employable in the future

2201
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,760
Instead of saying that I have three marriages

2202
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,440
how many hours are you coming

2203
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:53,520
But he is often not there

2204
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:54,360
what to do

2205
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:55,480
so something like this

2206
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:59,080
There seems to be an experimental one abroad in the UK

2207
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:00,080
one

2208
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,640
For example, he said that when you go to a certain department

2209
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,340
Then he set up to say

2210
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:07,640
Okay, you've only had to solve 20 problems for four years

2211
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:10,800
After you solve all the problems, you will graduate

2212
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,640
But every question he asks is to cross fields

2213
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,840
You have to read a lot of books to understand

2214
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,840
problem-oriented planetary model

2215
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,840
I also have such a practice

2216
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,340
From now on, there will be more media and more tools

2217
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:26,040
The change of the form of your evil image

2218
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,040
Now there is another terrible

2219
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,040
I don't know when

2220
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:33,040
Also, the development of digital TV in Taiwan is relatively slow

2221
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,040
After that, the digitalized machine price environment will be slanted

2222
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,040
because digital tv

2223
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:40,040
A digital TV is a computer from a certain point of view

2224
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:43,040
So many of your interactive teaching desks can be placed on it

2225
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:46,040
so i hope he doesn't arrive so early

2226
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:49,040
Because I prefer to enjoy life

2227
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:52,040
I'm sitting in the living room and I still have to study with you, right?

2228
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,040
I might as well go to a acting show, right?

2229
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,040
But this is weird

2230
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:59,040
But there may be such a problem in the future

2231
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
So will this have side effects?

2232
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,680
you digital tv

2233
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:05,440
Then you have interactivity again

2234
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,720
Digital teaching materials come again

2235
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:09,220
digital teaching material

2236
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:09,780
right

2237
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:11,520
And he can interact with you

2238
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,920
and integrated with the phone system

2239
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:14,520
right

2240
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:16,280
see half broken

2241
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,720
There is another call in

2242
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,000
tell you not to sleep

2243
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,120
what to do

2244
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,120
right

2245
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,000
so troublesome

2246
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,400
The aftermath of this

2247
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:24,560
very scary

2248
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,400
right

2249
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:28,000
So Taiwan's digital TV didn't come so early

2250
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,240
otherwise it will be miserable

2251
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:30,440
Will this affect

2252
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,560
Will

2253
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:34,280
From the point of view of the assisting community

2254
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,440
inevitable problem

2255
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,160
we need to discuss

2256
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:38,720
hopefully we'll find out

2257
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,560
normal learning style

2258
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:40,760
right

2259
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,600
reduce its sequelae

2260
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,520
So a situation like this

2261
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:48,760
It will be a very troublesome thing in the future

2262
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,880
there is another

2263
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,320
electronic learning machine

2264
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,080
or digital toys

2265
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,720
Another smart online learning tool

2266
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,360
Join the iPad

2267
01:26:59,360 --> 01:26:59,960
EPad

2268
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,900
This is an information feed

2269
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,900
if you design

2270
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:04,900
he really is a message

2271
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,600
It's like I'm talking about your iPad in the future

2272
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,100
As soon as the relevant information is posted here, it will come out.

2273
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:10,800
He will deal with you

2274
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,900
it's all possible

2275
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:13,700
Because this technology also exists

2276
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:14,600
right

2277
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:17,200
That Pedro you must face now

2278
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,000
we did something recently

2279
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,900
all our supervisors all

2280
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:24,200
All can't bury the iPad

2281
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:26,700
so they are happy

2282
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,200
You see, the principal is good.

2283
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:30,000
Give us one iPad per person

2284
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,900
Then I gave him a reason and said

2285
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:32,400
no way

2286
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,000
Because the principal is presbyopic

2287
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:36,900
So I bought an iPad after all to amplify it

2288
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:38,800
Otherwise, can't you see it every time you look at the paper?

2289
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,300
they thought this

2290
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:42,400
Actually where is my male model

2291
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,100
Because someone has an iPad since then

2292
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,600
I don't spend paper anymore

2293
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:49,400
All paper, all endless

2294
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,600
Only then did they know that my purpose is to promote endless

2295
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,100
So while there's an iPad on it that can zoom in

2296
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:56,100
so happy

2297
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,000
But it works well

2298
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,000
I think we are always learning now

2299
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,880
After giving one, everyone is looking forward to it

2300
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,120
As a result, the first time I came to a meeting, there was no paper

2301
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,520
Without paper, he started looking at the computer

2302
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,640
look at the screen and so on

2303
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,240
The meeting was also good

2304
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,840
so this changes

2305
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,040
this is a tool

2306
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,360
Therefore, in the future, this electronic protocol tool

2307
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,640
will really come more

2308
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:19,200
But what will the teacher do in the future if there are sequelae?

2309
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,760
I'm thinking everyone gets an iPad

2310
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,800
right

2311
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,320
Then every protocol member is busy in class

2312
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,640
don't even look at the teacher

2313
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,800
I have a feeling after endless transformation

2314
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,360
I am the chairman and no one wants to see me

2315
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,120
no one wants to see me

2316
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:35,840
Everyone is looking at his iPad and not at me

2317
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,040
This is also a very troublesome thing in the future

2318
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:40,960
don't know how to explain the problem

2319
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,880
later you see

2320
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:46,080
In the future, if each symbiotic can keep one step

2321
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,240
He just looks at his iPad

2322
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,320
Look at his tutorial tools

2323
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,360
I see his tutorial tool

2324
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,360
Then the teacher interacts with the students

2325
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,360
How to link this mechanism again

2326
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,560
how to connect again

2327
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,280
So this needs to be dealt with

2328
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
one of the satellites

2329
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:03,380
an online learning tool

2330
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:05,380
like that quiz

2331
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:06,620
right

2332
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,500
Our school has developed several testing systems

2333
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,020
also quite intelligent

2334
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:13,920
In terms of language, we have developed

2335
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,140
For example, a few indicators and a few parameters

2336
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:19,660
This parameter can be used to judge the readability of your article

2337
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:20,940
i have readability

2338
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:23,580
Then we have done a set of rewriting

2339
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:26,520
that is we have a new book center

2340
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,800
Specially responsible for junior high school locomotives

2341
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,560
original design purpose

2342
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:34,120
See if you can expect the teacher to correct the composition

2343
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:35,680
Because it doesn't mean that the composition is graded

2344
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:38,240
That design is really good

2345
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:40,000
and we have evaluated

2346
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,500
change with real people

2347
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,660
change with computer

2348
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:44,260
how relevant is it

2349
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:46,000
Its related machine is almost the same

2350
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,400
That is to say, you use a computer to change

2351
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:48,960
follow the employer to change

2352
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,260
Actually not much difference

2353
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,800
In the end we dare not launch

2354
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:53,160
Why dare not launch

2355
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,720
Because no matter what you say, the parents won't believe it

2356
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,360
that

2357
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,060
Parents don't believe it

2358
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
The computer can be shocked

2359
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,000
The idea is the same, right?

2360
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
How could his parents believe that the composition was modified by a computer?

2361
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
It's the same as people change

2362
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Even if there is no so-called difference in our research

2363
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
But we just dare not use that to change

2364
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
or use people to change

2365
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Then use someone to change it

2366
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
But sometimes people are wiser

2367
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Like our current new car center, the remodeling is very powerful

2368
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
So you have to believe it's fair

2369
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Why

2370
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
I'll tell you a secret

2371
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
All the composition teachers corrected all the essays on the computer

2372
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
So all your sketches and essays

2373
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
All will be scanned into the computer

2374
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
So you look at the computers in the classroom

2375
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
All composition correction teachers sat on it and corrected

2376
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Then when changing, we will hide some compositions

2377
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Already know which set of compositions

2378
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
we have already classified

2379
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
For example, this composition has been divided into three episodes

2380
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Then he will write this composition

2381
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
plug it into one of our teachers

2382
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
The teacher didn't know that this side thought it was our tears

2383
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
It's us hiding inside, not the composition of the co-existence

2384
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
It's us, just...so that teacher will change

2385
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Then if he changed it, he gave it a score of six

2386
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
what does that mean?

2387
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
The standard should be three points.

2388
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Then how do you give six points?

2389
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
So naturally a teacher would go to him

2390
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
that teacher will get him

2391
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Go to a counselor for counseling

2392
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Just ask him what's your problem?

2393
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Then you start doing counseling

2394
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,000
So as long as you are found, it means you have a problem

2395
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
So we use something like this

2396
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
So there is a counseling mechanism put in

2397
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Of course, education and training must be done before changing the composition

2398
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
tell everything

2399
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
But in education and training, we still have to be afraid of many human factors.

2400
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
So we will insert some composition into it

2401
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Then ask him to correct the composition

2402
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
After asking him to change it, if the deviation is too large

2403
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
we start tutoring

2404
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
So something like this, this even the test has to come to us

2405
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
use our trick

2406
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
He also needs to change the exam, right?

2407
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
this is called

2408
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
So we all have faith in our counselors

2409
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Everything can only be changed after belief

2410
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
The smart eLearning process

2411
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
A four-star teaching

2412
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I can follow your ability

2413
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
To judge your ability and give you different teaching materials

2414
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I give you different teaching materials

2415
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Now the four-star test is very important

2416
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
It is to give you different tests according to your ability

2417
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
So the quiz questions are different for each of you

2418
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Give points based on your quiz questions

2419
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
So he has such a practice

2420
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
that this

2421
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
this can never be done

2422
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
because this is too much

2423
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,000
too much worth doing

2424
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Another one is that

2425
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
this should be next

2426
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
The whole small screen learning content

2427
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
when the screen was small

2428
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
picture

2429
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
if you are a tablet

2430
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
still slightly larger

2431
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
If your phone is smaller

2432
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
right

2433
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
A design of the whole learning content

2434
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
There are also four-star digital learning content

2435
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
it will be the kind of talent

2436
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Learning Content

2437
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
That gives you different content for judging your ability

2438
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
This is a very complicated part of me

2439
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
There are also agreements other than knowledge learning

2440
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Like this I have been encouraging teachers to do

2441
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,000
For example, how do you design a learning tool

2442
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
To develop students' communication skills

2443
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
how do you design a learning tool

2444
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
To develop students' ability to be business owners

2445
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
It's not about knowledge

2446
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
So how do you design tools to develop students' reasoning skills?

2447
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
A practice like this

2448
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
This place is really worth developing

2449
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
and it's not easy to do

2450
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
OK good

2451
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Then I'm probably very simple in the end

2452
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
make a conclusion

2453
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
there are several parts

2454
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
The first environment where handrails no longer learn

2455
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
more and more international attention

2456
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Plus the future camp end

2457
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
This will definitely change our education a lot.

2458
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Especially after the 12-year state religion came in

2459
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
time stretched

2460
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
After a stretch

2461
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
it will change a lot

2462
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
so

2463
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Now the balance of that camp

2464
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Platform usage is simply too high

2465
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:11,000
And now many students are very good at taking a small software on the silver terminal as falling

2466
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Then learn directly on the screen

2467
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
and even while

2468
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:21,000
So maybe in the future we will be very similar to Japan

2469
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,000
For example, if you go to Japan to do his MRT

2470
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,000
You will see a lot of Japanese people playing with their mobile phones over there, right?

2471
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:33,000
We also hope that one day we in Taiwan will also look at mobile phones

2472
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
But looking at the learning class cage

2473
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
In this way, our competitiveness is higher than his

2474
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
He watched maybe a game and we watched learning cages

2475
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
maybe there will be

2476
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
unit becomes small

2477
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
For example, your study time becomes shorter

2478
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
there are a lot of shortening

2479
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
But the aftereffects of the place I just talked about

2480
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Knowledge will be very spilled

2481
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
The second high-quality learning environment

2482
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Not limited to online learning

2483
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,540
for dust learning

2484
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:03,840
in the school system

2485
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:06,900
transmission of knowledge

2486
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,720
The transmission effect between people is better

2487
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:11,020
through computer

2488
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:13,320
It doesn't deliver that well

2489
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:15,620
Then how do you teach the entity

2490
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:18,440
Integrate it with online teaching

2491
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:19,720
put it together

2492
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:21,760
one like this

2493
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:23,560
For example, in your laboratory you do experiments

2494
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:24,580
do experiments

2495
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:25,860
on the internet

2496
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:28,680
Networked labs have their advantages

2497
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:29,700
what's the advantage

2498
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,280
because it is simulated

2499
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:32,300
simulate a laboratory

2500
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,360
Simulating a lab has one benefit

2501
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:36,140
what it can do

2502
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,420
from failure

2503
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:38,700
write in error

2504
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:41,260
Trial and error is not written in doing

2505
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:43,820
We put a lot of emphasis on writing in Chinese

2506
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:44,600
But what?

2507
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:46,900
If it is on the Internet, it can be wrongly written

2508
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:49,200
you keep on trial and error

2509
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:51,240
I try and make mistakes because it's safe

2510
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:52,520
it can be safe from mistakes

2511
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,060
i remember

2512
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,620
I bought one of those before

2513
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:59,900
That Microsoft designed a Flightshake

2514
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,380
Just simulate waving, right?

2515
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:05,940
I've never been trained to swing

2516
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:07,280
then play that one

2517
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,840
Every time halfway through the game, the plane is like this

2518
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,680
just come down

2519
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:14,480
But no matter how much I fall, it won't affect me

2520
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,480
right or wrong

2521
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:17,040
because it is safe to experiment with

2522
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,880
This is a very good market pattern

2523
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:22,320
There is indeed such a function on the Internet

2524
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,520
I do have a lot we can't do in practice

2525
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:26,880
For example, if you do a chemistry experiment

2526
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,680
Can you fail safely in a lab?

2527
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:31,400
maybe come back once

2528
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,400
But the network can continue to repeat

2529
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,900
you find the best

2530
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:36,900
And the second network also has a

2531
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:39,400
One advantage of online teaching materials

2532
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:40,400
able to control

2533
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:43,400
You can control the progress of teaching

2534
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:45,400
Can control parameter changes

2535
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:48,400
You can go to a parameter for a Spring-style change

2536
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:49,400
and watch it change

2537
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:50,900
I can do it all

2538
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:53,400
There is also a section on humanities

2539
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:56,900
The humanities part is not easy to present on the Internet

2540
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:58,200
this is the truth

2541
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:00,200
Natural science is better presented

2542
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,160
But the humanities part should present really good teaching content through the Internet

2543
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:06,360
sometimes bad presentation

2544
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:10,920
Sometimes a face-to-face learning between people is better

2545
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:15,080
So the factor that emphasizes the so-called powder layer practice is here

2546
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:18,640
That is to say, there are some things that you can learn through the Internet

2547
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:21,160
If there are some units, you study in the classroom

2548
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:22,720
or study in the lab

2549
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:25,680
so this place is one of its focal points

2550
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:29,840
Another tutorial that is increasingly emphasizing social groups and motivation

2551
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,520
because of online learning

2552
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,400
Cooperative Learning

2553
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:37,120
But the place where you study is you alone

2554
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:40,280
Well, there is also the aftermath of this on the Internet.

2555
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:42,760
This is all to be dealt with

2556
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:45,040
In addition, learning tools will become more and more simple

2557
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,760
will become easier

2558
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:48,600
Especially after silverization

2559
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,040
Silverized complex placed on the silver side

2560
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:51,760
right

2561
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:55,040
Simple as a tablet for your personal use

2562
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:59,800
So the computer is no longer as complicated as a normal personal computer

2563
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,600
It's about how to make a connection between these places

2564
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:10,760
Therefore, there are a lot of things that need to be gradually stored in the reprinted computer.

2565
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:13,320
Especially Taiwan's IC chip design is very powerful

2566
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,600
As long as you can imagine it is designed for you

2567
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,960
So the tool itself can be hardened

2568
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,000
Learning tools can be hardened in the future

2569
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,320
In addition, there are formal learning

2570
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,880
There are more and more opportunities for Informal learning

2571
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,920
The need for education is increasing

2572
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:33,280
So if you have a look at Luohu Tools

2573
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:37,360
You can often see many students sitting in a certain portrait

2574
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:38,640
then draw

2575
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:41,480
So they've been trained like this since they were little

2576
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,120
This is all formal learning

2577
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:45,720
In addition, the simulation type and the game type

2578
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:48,560
You can also do humanities subjects like simulation

2579
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,760
Humanities can also be simulated

2580
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:52,840
Not that only physical chemistry

2581
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:54,280
because you can simulate situations

2582
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:55,560
Can do situational simulation

2583
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:58,360
There is a way of learning called

2584
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:00,000
the kind called

2585
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,260
writing with situational awareness

2586
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:03,460
what does it mean

2587
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:05,960
Let's say we're driving

2588
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:08,460
We must drive to the coach field

2589
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:11,260
After the coaching field exam

2590
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:12,260
you have a driver's license

2591
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:14,260
but where is the problem

2592
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:16,260
Does having a driver's license mean you can drive?

2593
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:18,260
not necessarily

2594
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:20,260
because you didn't practice the situation

2595
01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:22,260
you go uphill

2596
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:23,760
then start uphill

2597
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,760
And the condition of various roads

2598
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,760
you haven't practiced

2599
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:28,920
this is

2600
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:31,920
Cut and sweep the cognitive writing of that situation

2601
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:32,920
there is another one like this

2602
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:33,720
I remember

2603
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,320
I remember exercising

2604
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:36,420
then golf

2605
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:37,520
I don't know how to fight

2606
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,720
So I go to the driving range every time

2607
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:41,020
When it comes to the driving range

2608
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:42,420
I actually played well

2609
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:43,920
Easy to play every time

2610
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,860
Then I went to Australia once

2611
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:48,720
Then my friend said let's continue to play the scene

2612
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:50,260
it's my first time

2613
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:51,620
It's really embarrassing the first time

2614
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:51,920
Why

2615
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,820
'Cause I can't even hit the first ball

2616
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:55,820
a lot of people lined up behind

2617
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:57,880
What's Next to Receive Situational Awareness

2618
01:39:57,880 --> 01:39:59,880
That is to say, you did not go to that situation to write

2619
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,840
So you don't even know what date you want to work at this time

2620
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:04,600
you don't even know

2621
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:06,920
So this is also a

2622
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:11,000
Sometimes it can be shaped like this in a simulated environment

2623
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,320
let you experience

2624
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:16,380
Opportunities to write interest other than knowledge

2625
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:18,440
I think this has just been said

2626
01:40:18,940 --> 01:40:21,240
This category is a case like this

2627
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,800
I'm probably talking about this very briefly

2628
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,880
Then there's a little time for you guys to ask questions.

2629
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,160
we make an interaction

2630
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:29,080
make an interaction

2631
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:29,960
Do you have

2632
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:32,000
All questions please

2633
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:37,120
It is very simple to ask Principal Zhang three questions

2634
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:40,700
The first question is the APP software of your rigid body

2635
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:44,800
That is to say, in the future, the camp software will pass through this.

2636
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:47,620
please explain his

2637
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:48,900
his usefulness

2638
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:50,180
but the second is you

2639
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:54,020
Did Principal Zhang think that the Three Kingdoms game

2640
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,320
computer games for kids

2641
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,120
Parents can rest assured

2642
01:40:58,620 --> 01:40:59,900
the third is

2643
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,120
In addition to storage

2644
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:06,680
Ask Principal Zhang if he has other functions

2645
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:07,580
Thanks

2646
01:41:07,580 --> 01:41:11,040
I think the future development of the camp is really a lot

2647
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,920
because he has a lot of small supplies

2648
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:15,460
For example, his sister has a problem in your life

2649
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:17,040
And he sells them very cheaply

2650
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:19,360
say 0.99

2651
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:21,840
$0.99 and more

2652
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,160
then look now

2653
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,960
There are many functions now

2654
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:27,840
I don't know what function it has for commuting.

2655
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:28,720
no no no

2656
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:31,520
There are a lot of software in his APP Store

2657
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,560
Then in your APP Store

2658
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:36,200
There are various application agents

2659
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:38,840
So as long as you want all kinds of application agents

2660
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:41,880
It can be converted into an APP in the camp

2661
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:42,880
So he has a great range

2662
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:45,880
So in fact our generation

2663
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:47,760
must face that problem

2664
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,640
Everyone must go to understand the camp

2665
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:53,080
Sometimes we ask ourselves children are faster

2666
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:54,880
Because kids are great

2667
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,960
Because they have a high chance of cooperative learning

2668
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,680
They can exchange experiences with each other

2669
01:41:58,680 --> 01:41:59,920
So sometimes ask him

2670
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
what kind of software do you want

2671
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
If you ask him, he can find it for you.

2672
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
You can also read newspapers, magazines

2673
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
now have

2674
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
How are we now, Master Shi?

2675
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
is lent the tablet to the students

2676
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
We're here to borrow a book, not a book

2677
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
is a tablet for you

2678
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Then there are a lot of e-books in this tablet

2679
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
We also caused him to lend him

2680
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
You pay it back in about two weeks

2681
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,000
So the qualitative change of the library will also change in the future

2682
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
He's not borrowing a book, he's borrowing a vehicle

2683
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
In fact, I read e-books like this

2684
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
So this will have many functions in the future

2685
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Not only educational function

2686
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
I am not only educational

2687
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
As for gamification software

2688
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
really pick carefully

2689
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
In fact, I can only see now

2690
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
a long time ago

2691
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
because he cosplays

2692
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
A lot of fun

2693
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
but he's cosplaying

2694
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Is there a transfer learning effect?

2695
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
I don't think he has the knowledge to pass on

2696
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
but he has

2697
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
The main thing I gave that example is

2698
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
He has changed your values

2699
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
this is one of his

2700
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,940
This value change is sometimes impossible in transactions.

2701
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:05,440
So it is also very difficult

2702
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,440
but i don't encourage

2703
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:12,040
The kind that really let children play too much game

2704
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:12,940
that software

2705
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:16,140
Because our current game software is very violent

2706
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:18,840
Yes, so I asked Principal Zhang for advice.

2707
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:21,840
Is that the Romance of the Three Kingdoms game for children to give up?

2708
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,340
Now that was ten years ago

2709
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:25,540
probably gone now

2710
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:26,340
it's gone now

2711
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:27,240
probably gone now

2712
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:28,840
so you still have to see

2713
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:30,240
what's the best now

2714
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:31,240
best now

2715
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:33,240
at least i personally think

2716
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:35,740
I don't see anything I like so far

2717
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:38,240
Even though it's billed as educational software

2718
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:41,440
But I think its educational model is wrong

2719
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:44,640
For example, there is a software that writes English

2720
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,640
English teaching

2721
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:47,640
That English is called designing a screen

2722
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,040
I design a picture

2723
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:50,140
After designing a screen

2724
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:51,640
There are many screens such as

2725
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:54,640
Just make a seawater anomaly

2726
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:57,140
Then the children can

2727
01:43:57,140 --> 01:43:58,640
seawater anomaly project

2728
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:00,040
you can click it and it will be given to you

2729
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,740
Then click on each word to practice calligraphy for you

2730
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:04,740
But the problem is that kids won't order that.

2731
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:06,740
He can point to seawater anomalies such as parasols

2732
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:08,740
He ordered a parasol parasol and it became a what

2733
01:44:08,740 --> 01:44:10,740
turn into a rocket and swing out

2734
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:11,740
do you know what i mean

2735
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:13,740
At that point, the animation of a certain object will come out.

2736
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:15,740
I think this

2737
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:17,240
It was selling well

2738
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:19,240
But in terms of our education, that is useless

2739
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:20,240
why is it useless

2740
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:22,740
Because the students don't know how to click the English skill

2741
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:24,240
he's already going to something

2742
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:25,240
click on those objects

2743
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:27,240
Watch the animation behind them

2744
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:28,240
so i said i think about it later

2745
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:30,240
Barely say he is useful, say he is more humorous

2746
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:34,240
Because the production of his objects is beyond our imagination

2747
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,240
You said learning English is really useless

2748
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:39,240
So sometimes from an educational point of view

2749
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:41,240
educational software

2750
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:43,240
won't be very useful

2751
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:47,240
There are a lot of educational software that I think is wrong

2752
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:48,240
is not right

2753
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:50,240
Also his animation is wrong

2754
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:53,240
For example, many of his gamified educational software

2755
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:55,240
an apple falls

2756
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:56,240
two apples fell

2757
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:57,240
ask you how many apples

2758
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:58,240
make me plan is game

2759
01:44:58,240 --> 01:44:59,240
The first one is less fun

2760
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,320
That's a multimedia quiz, you know what I mean?

2761
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:05,120
so be careful

2762
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:08,320
So why is there such research on the market saying

2763
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:09,720
We want to import formal

2764
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:12,960
Instead of letting manufacturers use it directly

2765
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:16,720
Designing this software from the perspective of no cognitive theory

2766
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:19,000
The most important thing is such a situation

2767
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,320
So that needs to be tuned and done carefully

2768
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:23,160
not quite right

2769
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:25,520
In fact, this assistance community should be able to do it.

2770
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,000
but if do

2771
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,400
Make a comment on each game software

2772
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:32,160
we may be thrown eggs

2773
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,920
It's more troublesome at this point

2774
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:35,600
ok thank you professor thank you

2775
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,560
ok guys no more questions

2776
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:38,920
come please

2777
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:39,960
please teach me

2778
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:43,160
There are more and more opportunities for modern people to use computers

2779
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:45,240
Fewer and fewer opportunities for assistance

2780
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:47,720
An old human like me will

2781
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:49,120
often forget what help

2782
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:51,720
that overemphasizes computer teaching

2783
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,320
What about new humans?

2784
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:55,320
So we just said that we must know each other

2785
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:56,320
very important

2786
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:59,080
Some still need physical teaching

2787
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:00,200
so don't

2788
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
To think that the computer can expect us

2789
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Because in many theories

2790
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
This part of Practice still needs to

2791
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
actually do it

2792
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
this is impossible

2793
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
so i just said

2794
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,000
computers are really fascinating

2795
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
but it is easy to cause silverstone

2796
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
so why are we pushing this

2797
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
When computerized bloodshed

2798
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Also pay attention to its sequelae

2799
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Then also pay attention to when it uses

2800
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,000
If you can't grasp this point

2801
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,000
yes it will affect

2802
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
But we can't both

2803
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
you know what i mean ? because this is a period

2804
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
because it will

2805
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
You don't want to be affected and you will be affected

2806
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
This is like talking about networking

2807
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Many textbooks are wrong

2808
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
I remember a teacher once said

2809
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Then this is called wrong, we all should not read this kind of textbook

2810
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
but you must have

2811
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
but with a different attitude

2812
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Then you go to the wrong place to find

2813
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
find something wrong

2814
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
So just use the one that

2815
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
when and how to use

2816
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
is important

2817
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
then this is us

2818
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
unless we don't

2819
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Don't computerize everything

2820
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,000
But as long as computerized

2821
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
This is a phenomenon that must be faced

2822
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
This is

2823
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
it brings convenience

2824
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
But it also has repercussions

2825
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
There are some words we often forget too

2826
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
right

2827
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
because of the enemy

2828
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Now the enemy has this problem

2829
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
So your concern is the existence of

2830
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
But what we really want to care about

2831
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,000
find a way to make it normal

2832
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Do you have any other questions?

2833
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
please

2834
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Like Professor Zhang's answer just now

2835
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
i thought of a question

2836
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
In fact, what students need most is

2837
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
he has the ability to judge

2838
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,000
what is good quality

2839
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
That

2840
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
that is

2841
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Now

2842
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
you can know say

2843
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
A lot of game software is not that good

2844
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
But

2845
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Like all parents, the primary concern is

2846
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Do you still have the ability to judge

2847
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
right

2848
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,760
This leads to the essence of education

2849
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:05,560
In fact, we in Taiwan are really admitted

2850
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:08,920
Dreaming that there are many abnormal teaching

2851
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:10,360
it's really helpless

2852
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:14,000
Because this is no longer a question of so-called educational ideals

2853
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,560
but a political issue

2854
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:19,000
As long as there are political issues, many things are unsolvable

2855
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,840
But it's also a question of fairness

2856
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,640
Because we haven't developed

2857
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:27,160
Come out on that what communication skills

2858
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:30,520
Its venom ability a good Pacific system

2859
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:34,920
Then as long as your school is divided into good schools and bad schools

2860
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:36,160
there is this problem

2861
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:36,920
i have this problem

2862
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:37,680
so this is

2863
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:40,160
So we are not a normal teaching

2864
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:42,360
I want to promote in Normal University recently

2865
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:44,680
Put that maliciousness and the three evils into effect

2866
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:46,520
You students, don't talk nonsense

2867
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,600
I'm just pushing right now

2868
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:48,920
Why?

2869
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:50,280
because I always feel

2870
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:52,640
It is not easy for you to get into a school

2871
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:53,840
then why don't you give it

2872
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,680
give it a little more time to study

2873
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:57,280
give it some chance

2874
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:00,000
Especially our boys are relatively slow in academic achievement

2875
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:00,800
to show

2876
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:01,920
then you should let

2877
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:03,660
It's not about his character

2878
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:04,560
right

2879
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:07,200
But we talk to many actors like me

2880
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:09,160
You said I said people want to play tricks

2881
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:10,840
like us say we shadow play

2882
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:12,440
Can't go home every time

2883
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:13,560
because he thinks he

2884
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,120
He scored very well in the entrance examination

2885
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:18,000
I'm only ten points away.

2886
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:18,920
right

2887
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:20,800
Then what does it matter if you make him look like this?

2888
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:23,040
and you're not

2889
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:25,040
unless your resources are limited

2890
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:27,480
Because there are so many in one class

2891
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:29,560
If you transfer in, he may not be able to attend class.

2892
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:31,280
Otherwise, do you try to let him turn?

2893
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:32,800
because we have a survey

2894
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:34,080
that's really scary

2895
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,000
We have a program from our Normal University called

2896
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,600
Higher Education Database

2897
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:40,000
So we will analyze the situation of each school

2898
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:41,400
Then put the students

2899
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:43,080
why do you write this department

2900
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:44,720
Why did you study this school

2901
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,960
More than half are based on the opinions of parents and teachers

2902
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:49,760
really so

2903
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,400
and then after coming in

2904
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:55,640
related to his information after coming in

2905
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:58,800
In fact, a certain percentage is irrelevant

2906
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
He didn't want to read it

2907
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
but he came in

2908
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
why don't you let him at the college level

2909
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Go after what he wants to do

2910
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
what's the matter with spending a little more time

2911
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
For example, it should be a normal four-year graduation

2912
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
what does it matter if it takes two more years

2913
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
There are many who are not graduating

2914
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Achievements higher than ours abound

2915
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
right

2916
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
So sometimes the idea is to change

2917
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
But this place needs time to adjust

2918
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
For example, I always feel

2919
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Twelve Zero Country is a very important part

2920
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
That is to say, if he can

2921
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Take this Metal Ability well

2922
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
come out with good faith

2923
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
In fact, our competitiveness in the future is very strong

2924
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Look at how much we learn how to communicate.

2925
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Powerpoint won't do either

2926
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Knowledge collation will not write that report

2927
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
it's bad too, isn't it?

2928
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
It's all about faith

2929
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
have faith

2930
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
so this is your question

2931
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
is a big environmental problem

2932
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
We can't even do our own mistakes

2933
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
How to judge whether this thing is good or bad

2934
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,000
right

2935
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,440
In fact, the whole paragraph can't come out.

2936
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:02,440
how do you judge

2937
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:04,440
Because we can't blame the kids

2938
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:06,440
we didn't give him a chance

2939
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:08,440
In addition, I think the next generation

2940
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:09,940
like i have many assistants

2941
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:11,940
We often say that our symbiosis is a strawberry family

2942
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:12,940
I don't even admit it

2943
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:15,440
Then his hard work

2944
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:16,440
Then

2945
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:18,440
Then job status

2946
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:19,440
sometimes surpass us

2947
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:21,440
Never heard of them buying business

2948
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:24,440
So don't say that we kids are strawberries

2949
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:27,440
I have found many assistants

2950
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:28,440
I feel after passing

2951
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,880
Our next generation is actually very promising

2952
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,880
It's just that we have to give him a good direction

2953
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,880
good direction to do

2954
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:36,880
OK

2955
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:37,880
Excuse me

2956
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:38,880
take the opportunity

2957
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:40,880
flower old man

2958
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:42,880
OK, do you have any other questions?

2959
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:43,880
please

2960
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:44,880
Vice-Chancellor

2961
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:45,880
Excuse me

2962
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:47,880
i have a test question

2963
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:49,880
Will the quiz questions be asked publicly again?

2964
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:50,880
no

2965
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,880
I said it's about me personally

2966
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:54,880
more benefits

2967
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,880
I am the one who ate for 38 years

2968
01:51:57,320 --> 01:51:59,320
So I had an earlier review of the store

2969
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:00,320
so I

2970
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
I'm disgusted, I don't want to study

2971
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Because our time was

2972
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Erection skill

2973
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
From middle school to high school and then Wuzhuan University

2974
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
grind out

2975
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Then I always feel that the children now

2976
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
From the very beginning, I objected to my children learning that computer

2977
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
He becomes knowledge easy to get

2978
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
easy to forget

2979
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
If you ask him, he knows everything

2980
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
I don't learn it myself but

2981
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
wow recently i played that

2982
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
After that smartphone, wow, that sucks

2983
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
This computer is really fascinating

2984
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
But now the power is not good

2985
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I can't write it from scratch

2986
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
that's why i want to say

2987
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
directly from this tablet

2988
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Will there be a camp after the intervention?

2989
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
we don't need

2990
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
You don't have to work so hard to create a

2991
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
your database

2992
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
So is this okay?

2993
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I think from a learning point of view this is

2994
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Good practice, because there will be no standard in the future

2995
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
software

2996
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
There's no standard software either, anyway.

2997
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
and now the interface is very simple

2998
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Yeah

2999
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
But get used to the environment

3000
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,440
After you get used to the environment and establish

3001
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:05,280
For example, you are used to communicating with others on the Internet.

3002
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,840
Because some of them I haven’t faced face to face, why should I communicate with you?

3003
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,400
it's a matter of habit

3004
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:10,400
adaptation problem

3005
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:12,800
I think after you get used to it

3006
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:15,440
In fact, this can be learned at any time

3007
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:18,640
I began to think that there might be many bad things about computers

3008
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:20,000
recently feel

3009
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,840
I wear it together in the morning

3010
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:24,480
See which PPC can choose that

3011
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:26,440
important topic

3012
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:27,720
This solves it

3013
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:30,000
No wonder there is something wrong with the body

3014
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,720
Immediately fell for Google to find

3015
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:33,040
wow still very convenient

3016
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:34,720
Much faster than finding a doctor

3017
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,720
and believe

3018
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:38,400
do you believe it

3019
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:41,240
I have a lot of questions about the Normal University in

3020
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:42,760
know on the internet

3021
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:46,000
So I know what's wrong with many of our students

3022
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,800
Because it is easy for me to find the information inside

3023
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:52,000
Now what I want to write is that the first private school is not good

3024
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:52,720
then many

3025
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:54,760
you that you use again

3026
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:56,800
The tablet will zoom in and out

3027
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:59,280
Yes, that's what I said, just intervene directly from this

3028
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:00,280
don't intervene

3029
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
ok ok ok

3030
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Because in fact, our previous education was more of a crow style.

3031
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,000
For example, you might be interested in literature

3032
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
So your literature will remember

3033
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,000
But I can ask you how much physical chemistry do you remember?

3034
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:22,000
So sometimes the cultivation of learning ability is still very important.

3035
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Then you will naturally memorize the part you are interested in

3036
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
now we are not

3037
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Now we all have to write

3038
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
After finishing high school, this is a common problem

3039
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Like my personal history and geography is okay

3040
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
forget that chemistry

3041
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
none of them are there

3042
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
yes

3043
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Thanks

3044
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Are there any other questions?

3045
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
please

3046
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I would like to ask about the positioning of future teachers

3047
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Because recently, for example, I was looking at the formula

3048
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
The justice of the micro-sender

3049
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Harvard OpenCourseWare

3050
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,000
We also know that MIT actually had these things a few years ago

3051
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,000
In China, it is like Mr. Lu, a medicine man from the East China Sea

3052
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,700
A lot of the process of class is PO up

3053
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:06,600
And as long as the students of that relevant course go up to watch

3054
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:09,200
Maybe the teachers in their school have been compared

3055
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:12,800
If future teachers develop like this technology

3056
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:17,800
A lot of distance learning has turned into saying that you can actually learn more than online

3057
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:21,000
Better than school, the positioning of future teachers

3058
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,200
In which direction should it develop

3059
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:26,400
I mentioned that just now, actually

3060
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:29,300
Transfer of knowledge through the Internet

3061
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:32,300
If you are really like the teacher you said

3062
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:33,900
He is very proud of all aspects

3063
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:36,100
Then maybe you can watch it at home

3064
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:37,200
then no problem

3065
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:38,600
That's not the problem now

3066
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:42,100
Questions have many non-knowledgeable parts

3067
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:46,400
The human learning of the non-knowledge part is different

3068
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:49,800
It is very difficult to express through textbooks

3069
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:52,900
That's why I said that teachers in the future have to transform

3070
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:56,500
I said that after my student opened an underground website

3071
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:58,000
I'm starting to transform

3072
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,200
Because I know I can't teach my students anymore

3073
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
in computer skills section

3074
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Section in Computer Science

3075
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
What I want to teach is inquiry ability

3076
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
how to teach them how to form questions

3077
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
how to solve the problem

3078
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:12,000
How to use his creativity

3079
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
will be different

3080
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
So don't be afraid that humans will disappear

3081
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
human beings must have value

3082
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
My computer only expects a small part of us

3083
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
a small part

3084
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
So we're still valuable

3085
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
so don't worry too much about this

3086
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:30,000
It's not the disappearance of humans, it's the disappearance of teachers

3087
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,000
no

3088
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Not a Teacher Transformation

3089
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
The teacher is going to transfer

3090
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
The teacher is going to transfer

3091
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Even your teacher should start to know slowly

3092
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Knowledge conveys such a

3093
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
A role will slowly decrease

3094
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
then you may have to change your other character

3095
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
So why are there so many institutes now

3096
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
It doesn't matter if he doesn't go to class at all.

3097
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,000
I don't care even if you have fewer co-marriages

3098
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
no required courses

3099
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,000
You're going to read this book because you're doing research.

3100
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
right

3101
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,640
Why must the teacher teach you

3102
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:04,040
Then the teacher will act differently

3103
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,160
different so there will be an adjustment

3104
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,800
There will be an adjustment, you are a primary school student

3105
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:12,120
Primary school students are definitely not just passing on knowledge

3106
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:14,240
Universities are more knowledge transfer

3107
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:17,640
The development of training habits in all aspects of elementary school

3108
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:21,000
In the past, we put too much emphasis on knowledge

3109
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:22,920
while ignoring other aspects

3110
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:24,680
After that, other aspects may arise

3111
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:26,200
Then this teacher is going to change

3112
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:27,560
My teacher is going to change

3113
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:29,840
Do you have any other questions?

3114
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:33,040
Very close

3115
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:34,520
we are usually two

3116
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:36,680
Anyone else want to ask, kid, do you want to ask?

3117
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:41,440
this can't stop

3118
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:44,320
Then we listened to this speech by Principal Zhang

3119
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:48,440
For this infinite world of digital learning

3120
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:51,120
have an understanding

3121
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:54,000
I'm with him to host this digital point chief

3122
01:57:54,160 --> 01:57:55,880
Meeting with Digital Learning National Project

3123
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:59,240
For the first time after so many times, I have settled on his comprehensive view.

3124
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:00,080
I am Principal Zhang

3125
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,800
The Dean also reminds us

3126
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:03,600
There are a lot of side effects

3127
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:06,160
And that's only a small part of it

3128
01:58:06,160 --> 01:58:08,600
So there are many places in this

3129
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:10,400
still worth exploring

3130
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:12,860
his lecturer i think of a book

3131
01:58:12,860 --> 01:58:14,860
author of this book

3132
01:58:14,860 --> 01:58:19,860
was a physical chemist in the first half of the second century

3133
01:58:19,860 --> 01:58:20,800
physical chemist

3134
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:22,100
But he later studied physical chemistry

3135
01:58:22,100 --> 01:58:23,600
The original chapter is the last

3136
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:25,060
he turned to philosophy

3137
01:58:25,060 --> 01:58:27,800
and become a famous philosopher

3138
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:32,400
His son won the Nobel Prize with Dean Li

3139
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:33,800
his name is prangli

3140
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:35,400
He is a Hungarian nobleman

3141
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:37,200
He wrote a book called Personal Knowledge

3142
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:37,900
personal knowledge

3143
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:38,800
this is a classic

3144
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:40,900
I think there may be many people who know

3145
01:58:40,900 --> 01:58:42,500
Personal Knowledge

3146
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:43,600
This book tells us

3147
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:45,200
There are two kinds of knowledge we learn

3148
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:47,400
One is to concentrate knowledge

3149
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:49,000
There is knowledge of resources

3150
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,400
Subsidial Awareness

3151
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,300
is the knowledge of nearby resources

3152
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:53,900
he may be a hint

3153
01:58:53,900 --> 01:58:56,300
He may be a person and an atmosphere

3154
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:57,900
he may be a situation

3155
01:58:57,900 --> 01:59:00,200
he may be a fixer

3156
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,400
Wait, he may be out of admiration for this authority

3157
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:05,400
And the computer doesn't give you that feeling

3158
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:07,400
He may be because of these things

3159
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:10,400
will change your whole study of this

3160
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:13,400
So the computer may only

3161
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:16,900
Digital learning can be very effective

3162
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:19,900
The knowledge-focused part that helps us complete

3163
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:21,900
resource-conscious part

3164
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:23,900
resource aware part

3165
01:59:23,900 --> 01:59:27,900
And there is no way to replace the part of the uncle teacher.

3166
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:29,900
the planney book

3167
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:31,900
i read it a long time ago

3168
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:33,900
In fact, there is something in my impression that he said

3169
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:35,900
In fact, since the 19th century

3170
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:39,900
Western labs with big breakthroughs

3171
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:43,900
Most are in the tradition of his original laboratory

3172
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:47,900
Even if you give him the most complete manual for this tradition

3173
01:59:47,900 --> 01:59:49,900
He can't learn it all

3174
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:50,900
he can't help

3175
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:52,900
You give him this instrument

3176
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:54,900
You give him all the most complete Manual

3177
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:57,900
He still can't catch up with you up there.

3178
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:59,900
Because he has no Personal Knowledge

3179
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
So I think I totally agree with Principal Zhang on this

3180
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
right here

3181
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
teacher never dies

3182
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
teacher only aging

3183
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
he will never disappear

3184
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Thank you, Principal Zhang
