1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,080
who came to play this perfect round of军 insert Cassie neck

2
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:58,460
replaces our

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,040
Colleagues of the Intermediate Court and our good neighbors

4
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,840
good night everybody

5
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,840
we are very happy today

6
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,800
We invite you to our courtyard

7
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,160
Director of the Agricultural Biotechnology Center

8
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,400
Dr. Citizen came to speak to us.

9
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,160
Then this Director Shi, he was a few years ago in 2008

10
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,560
We worked very hard to bring him back from Yan'an abroad

11
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,400
When he was abroad, he was in

12
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,160
the elvo university

13
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,360
Before this, he graduated from the Biology Department of our Tunghai University

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,640
Go abroad after graduation

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,600
There should be soldiers, right?

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,640
Just to ask

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,040
Go abroad to Alvor University

18
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,120
this

19
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,880
Studying for a Ph.D.

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,920
Then went to Harvard to do research for a while

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,280
Then he was invited back to be a professor by his alma mater

22
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,720
When it comes to this, there is also a director of the laboratory

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
very well done

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
we were

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Also just being restructured

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
After several years of preparation

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
former preparatory office

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
can be regarded as the director

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Director Yang Qingsun also worked for a long time

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Laid out the technology very well

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
After the director comes back

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
in Taiwan

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
related to our agriculture

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Together

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
do it really well

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
with the Council of Agriculture

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
the farmer

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Course Basic Studies

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
are full of in-depth

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
practice

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
so today we

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
very happy to talk about this topic

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
because of this issue

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
now more and more important

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
we yesterday

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
in the yard now

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
A recently established

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
issues of sustainable development

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
sustainable development inside

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,200
Of course, this includes a lot. What you may be thinking is that

52
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,720
This climate change is causing many problems now

53
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,600
Agriculture has also been hit hard

54
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,920
Someone told me yesterday that if Taiwan did not have these natural disasters

55
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:27,760
Like this typhoon, the vegetables and fruits produced by our agriculture, etc.

56
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,320
It's all too much process

57
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,160
Well, our technology is actually very good.

58
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,520
Recently, in fact, you have also seen these bananas for sale.

59
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,520
It made President Ma very nervous.

60
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,320
so this

61
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,480
I said we are very, actually very happy in Taiwan

62
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,600
We do not lack these agriculture

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,880
But there are many countries that have food shortages and other problems

64
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,920
So this future agriculture

65
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,920
Must rely on these more advanced

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,400
Technology can help us solve many problems

67
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,360
recurring problem or

68
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,200
drought etc.

69
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,600
Therefore, Director Shi's research

70
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,600
is an expert in this field

71
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,400
For the so-called adverse environment

72
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,400
This effect on plants

73
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,800
Adversity, you may not be able to understand

74
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,400
what adversity is

75
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,000
because it is stress

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,200
In fact, a relatively simple

77
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Liu Zhang and Vice President

78
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,000
When I was the principal of Chuo University

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,800
He suddenly likes the Middle East, Chinese and Western

80
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,400
He kept asking about Zhongnan papaya

81
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,000
Why is there no flowering or fruiting

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,800
their driver told him

83
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,400
no problem you go get some nails

84
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,600
Nail that trunk

85
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,200
he asked

86
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,600
It really blooms next year

87
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
that is stress

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,800
i think plants are in pain

89
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,400
you nail it to him

90
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,800
Then he has to react

91
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,200
what you guys are eating

92
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,000
what black

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Lian Wu what is it called?

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Lianwu of black pearl

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It was also discovered by none of the farmers

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
A Phenomenon

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Lian Wu, which came out the next year, is very sweet and spicy

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
that is also a kind of stress

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But that's not easy to do

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Later, in those lands, they used seawater to crown

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Those lands can't be used later

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So there should be other ways to do these stress

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
that's us mayor

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Maybe I'll talk later, I don't know

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Another area that he is very concerned about now is

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Orchid, our grandma orchid in Taiwan

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He has done a very in-depth research now

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
he may explain later

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
so this future

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Everyone depends on him for food and food.

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So let's applaud him quickly. Come on.

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
good

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Thank you Dean Wang Wu

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
this introduction

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,940
I probably can't bear it

116
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,940
But I probably won't talk about much of my own research today.

117
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,720
But we should have plenty of time to ask questions

118
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,700
so you can stay till the end

119
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,640
Let's just ask me those questions

120
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,200
Then I didn't define what is called historical biotechnology at the beginning.

121
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Then I hope that by the end

122
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,500
Let's come back to discuss my reasoning

123
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:32,700
Why I choose the topic of my talk today as the prospect of biotechnology in history

124
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:38,900
In fact, the Science and Technology Advisory Group of our Executive Yuan was around 2000

125
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,300
just defined biotechnology

126
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,500
He said that biotechnology is the use of biological programs

127
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,000
Biological cells or their metabolites to manufacture products

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,900
Or scientific and technical personnel who improve the quality of human life

129
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:59,100
If you use this definition is a relatively narrow definition

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Use this definition to define what is biotechnology

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
if so

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Then let me start with the so-called green biotechnology

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
just set it as

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Primarily using cells related to plants

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
or metabolize substances to make some products

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
over the past 20 years

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That is to say, this so-called plant

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
agricultural biotechnology or

139
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The most notable achievement of green biotechnology

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
many people will notice

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm a so-called genetically modified crop

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So my speech today will be based on the period

143
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let me introduce you first

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
GM crops

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
but please

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If you have environmental protection against genetic modification

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
don't be nervous

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I will also explain at the end

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
In fact, it means

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
not necessarily that is to say

151
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
we do biotechnology

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Must rely on genetically modified crops

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So let's use fast

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
we'll talk about it until the end

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
problems in this area

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
that so

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,960
Because the application of biotechnology is the most important thing I'm talking about

158
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,760
Most notable achievement at the beginning

159
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,000
genetically engineered crops

160
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,160
This technology actually has a very not great picture

161
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,000
But the very important picture is the so-called gene transfer technology

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This technology is not only available to those who make plants

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
People who work as animals or living things have

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
current technology words

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,800
Because there are some viewers who are not living beings and are trapped

166
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
so let me introduce a little bit

167
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,300
all living things on earth

168
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,300
Our genetic material is all on the so-called blue physiognomy

169
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,000
The blue body is the DNA of the so-called double bone

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,800
There may be thousands of genes on a single blue body

171
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,300
We count each gene as a unit

172
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,700
The word of the gene will go through the so-called detour

173
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
so-called RNA

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,540
To RMA it will...

175
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,200
this is transfer, this is transfer

176
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,960
turn into protein

177
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,940
Most of the biological functions or structures

178
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,540
that protein is the most important

179
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,440
So you're going to modify a creature

180
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,040
What you have to change is to make it

181
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,540
that is to say it is protein

182
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,340
production of a specific protein

183
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,840
or more or less

184
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,540
or it doesn't make the protein in the first place

185
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,840
you let it make this protein

186
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,980
That's the easiest way to do it

187
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,580
you can achieve this

188
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,740
The easiest way is usually to

189
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,240
you changed the gene

190
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,180
or if you don't want it to have this protein

191
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,440
You give this gene to...

192
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,840
give it to...we call NACAO off

193
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,040
i will remove it

194
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,140
Then if you want it to express a new gene

195
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,380
a new protein

196
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,340
then you may use various methods

197
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,780
Insert this gene into this blue above

198
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,380
so that it can express this kind of a foreign gene

199
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,300
Want

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,140
This technology is what we call genetic modification

201
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,880
By definition, it is a bent gene

202
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,180
into cells or individuals

203
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,980
The definition is simple

204
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,520
help easier

205
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,600
In total, it can be classified into these four types

206
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,780
The latter three can probably be used in animals, plants or microorganisms

207
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,080
This gene gun is actually a gun

208
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,200
You're calling the gold one Lobarico

209
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,800
tiny gold particles

210
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,520
wrap that DNA on it

211
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,520
And then you literally take a gun and shoot it inside the cell

212
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,400
That is you can put this DNA

213
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,040
cell passed to another cell

214
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,200
These technologies are actually special instruments that you need.

215
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,680
and they are quite expensive

216
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,400
So if you are an animal, you need to transfer the value of the animal

217
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,640
that technique is difficult

218
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,920
that would be expensive for us

219
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,920
Then in the plant it has a special method

220
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,560
we are called

221
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,400
Replanting method in the agricultural management circle

222
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,960
Well, this is actually because we are doing plant molecular biology.

223
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,460
The technology written from nature

224
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,760
Then the replanting method of the agricultural management circle

225
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,660
The most important thing is in the natural world, I think if you see

226
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,320
you have that tree by the road

227
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,720
Or if grass is not healthy

228
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,660
Things that often have a long flow will go off

229
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,160
Well, this is actually the seed flow of plants.

230
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,160
it's the plants

231
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,520
look at this

232
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,220
This is a very typical

233
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,620
For this cancer, it is usually the same as our cancer cells

234
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,160
It keeps growing where it shouldn't grow

235
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,160
So maybe you are sometimes

236
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,260
You grow more near the place

237
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,360
or are you there

238
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,360
this is long is a kind of that

239
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,320
It's just a meristem without specialization

240
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,220
That's why it's happening in nature all day long

241
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,980
The reason why there is such a flow

242
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,920
that's because

243
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,340
Agrobacterium has this ability

244
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,620
it's bacteria

245
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,860
a fungus in the soil

246
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,860
Agrobacterium

247
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,500
English called Agrobacteria

248
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,340
It carries itself with its own blue body

249
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,300
It also has a function we call

250
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,400
Tumor inducing possum

251
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,540
It is equal to the carrier that you can self-cancer

252
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,240
This carrier has a piece of DNA on it

253
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,800
If you plant

254
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,080
if there is injury

255
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,000
It will infect the plant with this bacteria

256
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,480
Then put this piece of DNA

257
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,400
sent to the cell goose of the plant

258
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,080
then become plant cells

259
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,080
part of plant blue body

260
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,280
That one has a set of genes

261
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,440
its set of genes

262
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,740
Is it the same as our human cancer cells?

263
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,880
It causes cancer cells to continue to divide

264
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,380
Cancer cells then make some

265
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,400
Compound, what about this Seo Joon

266
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,760
will use these compounds as its nutrients

267
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,760
So it's a natural phenomenon

268
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,400
That is to say almost 30 years ago

269
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,960
That is to say, some molecular biologists who work on plants

270
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,200
they figured out a way

271
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,160
Take this set of DNA from the so-called Agrobacterium

272
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,660
replace it with harmless DNA

273
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,660
That is to say if you have any DNA

274
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,360
you're going to put it in the plant

275
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,860
you just replace this paragraph

276
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,420
If so

277
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,660
then you can

278
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,520
That is to say, you are the first to select a target gene

279
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,860
Then you put it in the Agrobacterium

280
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,060
And then you put it into the plant cells by the Agrobacterium

281
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,520
Then you put the plant cells into the cultured genes

282
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,660
Then in words like this

283
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,620
It's easy for you to have so-called genetically modified plants

284
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,960
The reason why this genetically modified plant is so simple is

285
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,640
In addition to this agricultural sense coupon can send DNA to the cells of plants

286
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:11,000
Most plants also have a very important characteristic

287
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,800
so-called tissue culture

288
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,640
For the plant, you have given it the proper grower

289
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,720
You can put its cells in an incubator

290
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,520
that is to say split

291
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:28,420
Then after splitting, you change to a certain type of cultivator

292
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,700
it will stick out its roots again

293
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,500
Then you are changing to a certain type of incubator

294
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,260
it will

295
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,580
Grow this above ground leaf

296
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,380
So these two properties

297
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,700
Farm sense coupons can deliver DNA to plant cells

298
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,480
Then

299
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,360
Plants themselves have the so-called ability to regenerate

300
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,140
so

301
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,140
stand up

302
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,760
We do so-called plant molecular biologists you want to make a genetically modified crop

303
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,120
In terms of animals, you do it one by one and we can do it at a time.

304
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,120
Just say it like this

305
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,220
So you are the genetic antison of your plant

306
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,940
It's rich and cheap

307
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,520
And it works and it's just not expensive

308
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,340
So almost twenty years ago

309
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
After this technology was invented

310
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,740
Scientists at that time thought

311
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,500
This can be said to bring

312
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,500
help with some agricultural issues

313
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:25,340
So at that time I thought those molecular biologists

314
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,060
When I started doing it, I actually thought it was just saying

315
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,720
Because this is a relatively accurate plant species

316
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,720
Because every time you change your genes

317
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,520
one gene at a time and puts it in another plant

318
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,040
In fact, our ancestors did domain species

319
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,880
It has been done for thousands of years, tens of thousands of years

320
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,560
The techniques they use are actually very similar

321
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,040
It's just that they're replacing a segment, a whole segment of chromosomes.

322
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,960
They have no way to accurately time

323
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,840
I just need to change a segment, a gene

324
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,960
They exchange entire chromosomes

325
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,020
So we're genetically engineered and we can

326
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So we don't have to put the diagnostic chromosomes all at once

327
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
In fact, most breeding in nature is unsuccessful.

328
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Because you change so many chromosomes, the creatures you create can't compete

329
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Just can't match the original Parental Strength

330
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
is its original copy or parent that competes

331
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So now 20 years have this technology

332
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
not only for researchers to do

333
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Some so-called Multic Companies are also starting to do this

334
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
In fact, there are several quite successful examples

335
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The first is crops that are resistant to pests

336
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Pest-resistant crops are actually learning from nature

337
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
There is a kind of building coupon in nature

338
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It secretes a toxin that kills

339
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,400
most insects

340
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,840
In fact, GMOs existed before

341
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,440
farmers are already using

342
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,400
that's them

343
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,720
macrotrophs

344
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,360
Then put Su Lixing's toxin

345
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,000
separate it

346
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,280
Then sprinkle it into the sky

347
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,600
this way to kill insects

348
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,160
But this insecticide is very expensive

349
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,360
later you are

350
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,640
The range of killing is sometimes uncontrollable

351
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,160
Especially in European and American farms

352
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,560
he sprinkled words with ash

353
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,240
often spilled on

354
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,360
That is to say, the granddaughter who is near

355
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,200
the next one is

356
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,120
he didn't kill

357
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,360
that will kill

358
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,040
may kill pests

359
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,880
So this is like cotton now

360
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,680
and Hawaiian sugar cane

361
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,280
Many of them have Su Lixing's genes

362
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,680
in him

363
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,080
In this way, it means

364
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,640
He is more resistant to insects

365
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,040
but

366
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,320
because you can't

367
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,520
if you just say

368
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,160
You put the whole area you want to plant

369
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,400
All insect resistant

370
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
then soon

371
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,000
From immediately it will evolve its anti-comfort properties

372
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So they're doing GM lotus now or it's dry

373
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
They say you have a special proportion

374
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
For example, one tenth of you is the dryness of rock fairy

375
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Ninety percent of this genetic modification

376
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Then when you harvest like this

377
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Once you come, you bug won't say that it has evolved drug resistance.

378
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So this means that if you add this genetically modified crop to other methods of picking

379
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You can probably be like one person, a forest is the control

380
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That is to say, you don't say that caused this, that is,

381
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
This evolution is very fast

382
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
that will bring disaster to you again

383
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So the combination of the two is actually quite effective.

384
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So the dryness of Hawaii has probably been said for at least ten years

385
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So far no major problems

386
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That's because it's traditional farming in other ways

387
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,600
Combined with biotech it becomes very ineffective

388
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,200
Now China is growing a lot of cotton in the same way

389
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,300
The other one is anti-sand sweeping chicken

390
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,400
In fact, traditional agriculture

391
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,540
Especially in the United States, it is not called a collective farm

392
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,580
If it's a big farm

393
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,700
Are they all small farmers in Asia?

394
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,040
So their kitchen storage skills are handy.

395
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,820
Sprinkle it all in one piece

396
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,940
so usually very serious damage to the environment

397
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,760
So almost 20 years ago this Monsanto

398
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,600
They did it with corn and soybeans

399
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,700
Because they have a set of very good cooking skills

400
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,740
That is BioDegradable

401
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,040
That is to say, it is not very residual

402
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,100
But the problem is it doesn't just kill weeds

403
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,400
It also kills corn and soybeans

404
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,880
So-called herbicide-resistant chickens found

405
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,340
put it in the corn or put it in the big meat

406
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,520
So when it sells weed killer

407
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,640
sold with corn seeds

408
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,320
Until now, it is the so-called run up ready corn

409
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,280
This is it

410
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,480
Then if you check the Council of Agriculture

411
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,600
Most of the corn we import is this

412
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,040
So we have been eating for at least ten years

413
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,640
But this is actually if you evaluate it carefully

414
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,840
that's what it's really supposed to say

415
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,440
still achieve its original purpose

416
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,040
It's the one that makes COAG use less toxic

417
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,240
There are also cheaper weed killers

418
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,400
But in fact, Meng Sanduo earns the most money

419
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,560
Because it doesn't just sell weed killers

420
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,800
it sells seeds too

421
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,760
The other one is disease resistance

422
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,680
Then I think this is the same as the anti-pest mentioned above.

423
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,920
should be the same principle

424
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,000
that's it

425
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It can be naturally disease-resistant

426
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,160
or virus to drastically reduce pesticide use

427
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,860
This is a relatively unsuccessful example

428
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:14,120
Because of the action of the plant's follower bacteria or fungi

429
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,200
very so-called specificity

430
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,300
Usually it's what we call Gene Fire Gene Hituo

431
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:27,460
That is, your plants of a certain strain can only resist a certain kind

432
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,700
That is to say, inside the same kind of bacteria

433
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,460
it's all kinds of bad

434
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,560
I can't speak Chinese

435
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,600
just can't write

436
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,760
It's just different species from different places

437
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,800
Generally speaking, special strains are required

438
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,960
to resist this particular physiological race

439
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,060
So you have to develop a really resistant

440
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,060
Not so easy for all races

441
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,960
So this is a relatively unsuccessful example

442
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,860
The main reason is that our basic science is not good enough

443
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,460
Because we don't yet fully understand

444
00:21:59,460 --> 00:21:59,960
that is

445
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,100
Why do you have to plant a gene

446
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,940
And then this cellulite has a gene

447
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,740
Then the two have to interact

448
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,600
To determine whether there will be resistance

449
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,200
Although we have done this

450
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,940
I think the world doesn't know how many scientists have been doing it for thirty or forty years

451
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,240
we know some but not all

452
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,740
So this is not a particularly successful example

453
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,640
But I think if this can be done

454
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,940
That's probably the ones I introduced earlier.

455
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,640
have the same material

456
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,040
The other is to say

457
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,740
That this we can use the so-called biotechnology

458
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,240
to transform this important crop

459
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,740
The so-called high nutritional value crops

460
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,340
And this one was almost twenty-five years ago

461
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,040
That is, a scientist in Switzerland

462
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,540
He just did a set of experiments

463
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,940
He can learn from that flower by taking the rice

464
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,240
let him have a lot

465
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,720
high vitamin production

466
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,000
Vitamin A

467
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,400
Then this is actually

468
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,800
He put this seed is unconditional

469
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,560
It was unconditionally given to Huiser's country

470
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,960
That's actually very important

471
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,600
because in our asian country

472
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,440
especially in Taiwan

473
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,560
We think our vegetables are very rich

474
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,200
So we don't think vitamin B

475
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,240
What's so great about vitamin A

476
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,760
but in huiser country

477
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,480
because most of its children

478
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,000
source of nutrition

479
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,400
Mainly rely on staple food

480
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,800
so it's that

481
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,200
Many people just have that vitamin A

482
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,000
The lack of that phenomenon

483
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,920
that is, the disease

484
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,240
If so, it will cause

485
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,160
That is to say, the mans disease

486
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,400
that science

487
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,040
That is to say, it came out of the first generation

488
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,120
it is attacked that is to say

489
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,680
How many catties of rice do you need to eat a day?

490
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,400
you have the possibility

491
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,280
that is to say, what you call

492
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,720
enough vitamin A

493
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,120
That this is what is called

494
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,040
That is to say link

495
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
GMO people keep attacking it

496
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
That's actually a wrong message

497
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Because after ten years of his work

498
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
the one he does now

499
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Let's say the amount of vitamin A he produces

500
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
already high enough

501
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
That is to say, as long as you treat yourself as an ordinary host

502
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
you can make this

503
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
this do that gray state larvae

504
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
can just say

505
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
get enough gray lights

506
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
That's actually a very

507
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And this scientist didn't apply for anything

508
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
patent he said

509
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You need to know how to give gray light to the government

510
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But so far it doesn't work

511
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Why

512
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
because one of the most

513
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
his earliest

514
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I used a very common carrier

515
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
is a family

516
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
His patent is a

517
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The very big Milote company

518
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
He has been refusing to unconditionally

519
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Give this to Louis and say

520
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Say this Yonago is going to be in Gray State

521
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
don't need

522
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
That is to say, match him with that or that or something

523
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Patent Loyty's Ash

524
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
that to

525
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
should go here

526
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,600
These two years Burge Foundation should help

527
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,400
Now this rice should be ready soon

528
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,840
go to Huizhou

529
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,160
But that's at least a decade behind

530
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,560
That's because many scientists say the benefits are good

531
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,800
But in the end it's not really a matter of science

532
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,760
Instead, it becomes a Polish or economic problem

533
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,360
That's a sad example

534
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,120
Because when he did it more than 20 years ago

535
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,320
I mean it's a party

536
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,320
It's a pity that it's not available until now.

537
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,120
Then do we have in Taiwan?

538
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,560
Yes, we in Taiwan actually have several genetic modification effects

539
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,200
It's just that we're saying there's no clear Polish

540
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,680
So can you go up until now?

541
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,120
Without the effect of genetic modification made by us in Taiwan, it can be listed

542
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,200
Then that Dr. Zhenmincai from our Agricultural and Biological Center

543
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,600
He said he did a few

544
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:10,500
Do a few. Tomatoes can resist salt and liver disease

545
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:16,640
You may think that we don’t plant plants by the sea when we talk about salt resistance.

546
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,920
Why do anti-salt

547
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,780
Because we report that there are too many pesticides

548
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,620
In fact, our soil has become slowly developed

549
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:32,760
So you have to be persistent and good farmland will also become

550
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,340
The ion content in the soil will be too high

551
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,460
So salt resistance has always been a very hot topic

552
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,080
So Dr. Miantai successfully found several genes

553
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:51,200
You put it in a tomato and you can see it resists salt

554
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,500
This is another group of anti-hepatic cases

555
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:59,900
The other is Dr. Ye Xidong, former vice president of Central University

556
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
He is very famous for making papaya

557
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,760
Then his papaya's roulette virus

558
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,000
And that corporate virus

559
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,500
He has obtained double-resistant papaya

560
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,260
The Council of Agriculture has approved him to conduct field experiments

561
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,960
But he also passed the food safety virus of our Department of Health

562
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,160
But the farmer is not going to put it in Taiwan

563
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,600
Because Taiwan cannot be listed

564
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,000
This is available in India

565
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So this is probably for him to go to India

566
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,500
Then Wang Mu just talked about a papaya

567
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,000
You hit it and it will bloom

568
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,500
In fact, he has several types of papaya

569
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
that is to say he knows

570
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,200
Papaya bears the same plant as the magnetic bear

571
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,700
So if you're only a bear

572
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,500
It's useless for him to bloom

573
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,200
But in stretch is in adversity

574
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,300
That is to say, you use iron nails or knock it a few times

575
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,500
you don't use nails

576
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,300
Actually just knock a few times

577
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,800
That is to say, cut it off when he gets hurt

578
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,720
You will let it sometimes its bear will transform back to female

579
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,840
So this is or transforms into female bear and pig

580
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,860
So at that time, it was not because it was afraid that it would become enlightened.

581
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,880
but because it needs to be gendered

582
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,360
Then naturally there is this evolution, it has this so-called Beauty in the system

583
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:28,660
It is to let you be in the reception because in fact, the most important purpose of all living things is to wear

584
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,760
Then if you only grow bears in one place

585
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,380
Then it will find a way to change

586
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,100
So this Juris Park and that have some basis

587
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,560
The papaya itself is actually you just need to give it environmental adversity

588
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,280
It's a little bit bearish and it's going to be late

589
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,360
Then it can be solved like this

590
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:52,000
The other one is Dr. Chen Longwang from our Institute of Academia Sinica

591
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,460
All he did was make broccoli prolong life

592
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
what he does is you turn this upside down

593
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,600
Just put a gene in this broccoli

594
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,300
you take it off

595
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,500
and after you cut it

596
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
This is Wild Time

597
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,300
You can see he's just talking about circularizing soon

598
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,500
this is his

599
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,700
that is to say he did

600
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,300
just say something like this

601
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,600
after you have accumulated

602
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,300
the one he can have at the market

603
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,500
That is to say, the life span will be longer

604
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
Then I want these slides

605
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,100
have their condition

606
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,400
So you can also put it here

607
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,200
the other one is

608
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,700
Dr Hong Dong-won from our Central Post Office

609
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,100
Dr. Hong Dongyuan from Tian Jiaozhong

610
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,800
Find the two proteins that affect job-related allergic reactions

611
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,800
Then you put these two proteins together with Xun Xing

612
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,100
he will cause

613
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,300
Anti-disease mechanism that promotes duty

614
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,300
that this

615
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,300
Huang Dengyong is my senior

616
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,900
he with that

617
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,880
The scientist who made the golden rice mentioned above has the same attitude

618
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,880
He thinks biotech can do good

619
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,880
So he has a patent

620
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,380
But patents are not for sale

621
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,680
he is going to help others

622
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,880
So Mr. Feng is traveling around the world

623
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,340
Then he later discovered that in Africa, especially in Central Africa, the Yana generation

624
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,920
Bananas are their main source of telegrams

625
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,460
In recent years, they have had that banana and that tail-adjustment disease

626
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,760
Teacher Feng was very enthusiastic to apply.

627
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,160
Woolen

628
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,160
Then train the scientists of this pit ya

629
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:49,160
teach them how to make GM bananas

630
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,660
Later the BioGate Foundation paid

631
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:57,660
It is to let the government in Kengya start to have a system to do this

632
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,900
It means that we are the best in biology, so we can introduce this in it.

633
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,600
The results of this experiment by Mr. Huang Fangyong

634
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,400
Then this Central Plains Institute was when the Dean of the Idea

635
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,200
patent

636
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,400
hand him over to the government of the world

637
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,800
so that they can experiment with this

638
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,900
Well I guess this isn't really meant to help

639
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,400
The issue of the laser in the countries of China and Wiener

640
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
this is very important

641
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,200
Because intersecting is really what they host

642
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,200
if there is no medicine

643
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,400
that is to say you have so far

644
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,200
And you can't find the insecticide that works

645
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,600
It's just that your chemicals aren't very effective.

646
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,400
So this is a

647
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,100
It's actually a great contribution

648
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:46,600
That Mr. Huang just gave this for free

649
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:52,100
So I told those few examples

650
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,800
That is to say, those of us

651
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,400
It is my predecessors and scientists of our generation

652
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,900
We do these things in fact we feel

653
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,380
That is, if you're doing the right thing about so-called biotechnology

654
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,400
is supposed to increase crop yields

655
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,460
can also reduce the godhead

656
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,740
And that means we want to minimize the damage to gold

657
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,620
nutrition that can also improve human health

658
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,300
The question is, are institutional plants really that safe?

659
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,540
there are two possibilities there are two you will worry about

660
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,820
The first one is whether it is practical or not safe

661
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,860
I think this should be safe

662
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,060
because the food we eat every day

663
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,260
Eating foreign DNA

664
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,260
Including the DNA of animals, plants and bacteria

665
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,340
we eat them all

666
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,660
And we humans have already

667
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,700
That is to say, it has been developed for almost 100,000 years.

668
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,580
should be no problem

669
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,220
All the DNA you eat is digested

670
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,460
So this shouldn't be the main problem

671
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,860
Practical and safe I think so far

672
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,220
Didn't say you did genetic modification

673
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,220
How about being poisoned after eating GMOs?

674
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,380
This should be a non-scientific question

675
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,020
It should mean that he and others

676
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,040
You're at about the same risk from eating other foods

677
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,380
I wouldn't say it's more dangerous

678
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,080
But there is one thing you should consider

679
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,880
Will it have an impact on the ecological environment?

680
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,700
you want me to say depend

681
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,580
That is to say, it depends on what kind of genetically modified crops you make

682
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,800
Some will spread if, say, you are patterned

683
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,740
spreads far

684
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,840
Then its patterns have certain properties

685
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,380
likely to interbreed with other species.

686
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,340
that maybe

687
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,680
But the problem is we actually have the technology now

688
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,880
will control this

689
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,840
We can just say let you get that to that

690
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:46,580
The most important thing is that you passed it in.

691
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,580
We're doing this genetically modified crop

692
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,380
A few genes should be placed in the middle so that you can choose

693
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,080
Those genes are usually associated with antibiotics

694
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,580
can be antibiotics

695
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,920
So you are afraid that this kind of thing will pollute the environment

696
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,860
We now have the technology to remove it

697
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,840
After your genetically modified crops are made

698
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,640
The gene you want goes in

699
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,340
You can take these so-called vulture genes and remove them

700
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,000
So this should not be

701
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,640
It should mean that we can solve it now

702
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,940
But I think we still need to have a

703
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,400
Rigorous evaluation process and management information

704
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,340
That is to say, if you have a

705
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,300
That is to say, if there is a very strict procedure

706
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,340
I don't think this should be a major problem

707
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,000
But we need a check system

708
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:36,580
That's what I'm talking about now

709
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:44,380
It seems to mean that your biotechnology is used to make genetically modified crops

710
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,040
So I'm going to use a practical example now

711
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,540
Just use the tunnel example to convince everyone

712
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,740
That is to say, genetically modified crops are only part of biotechnology.

713
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,940
rather than all of it

714
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,940
Then you if I hope that means you arrive

715
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
You can feel it after I say this

716
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,500
If you can flexibly apply biotechnology

717
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,700
you should be able to do well then

718
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,500
than you mean you can

719
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,700
What you have to worry about is a lot more

720
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,600
So what I'm going to say now is

721
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,400
That is to say, how do we use quality-based breeding

722
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,800
To cultivate the quality of those saltwater waterways

723
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,200
Then this salt water is actually a very important

724
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,500
that agricultural problem

725
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,800
That world means agriculture every year

726
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,800
The loss caused by pickling water will probably stand in vain

727
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,400
That is to say especially in that

728
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,700
in that is to say the main river

729
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,500
The place where there are floods and floods

730
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,300
this is the main problem

731
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,000
that unfortunately most of us

732
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,700
the cultivated crop

733
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,600
After spraying with pickled water, you will lack oxygen

734
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,800
So most of the crops

735
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,700
can only live

736
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,100
survive for a short time

737
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,500
Even if there are a lot of crops that will be flooded

738
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,000
small amount of corn soybean

739
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,120
wheat sorghum

740
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,160
The flooded main do have a

741
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,960
There is rice

742
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,580
because you rice you can almost grow it in water

743
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,160
But in fact, in the various strains of rice

744
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,080
It also has a different kind of collection for that flooded

745
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:26,380
Then this is an experiment done at the Philippine International Rice Research Center

746
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,340
It combines two different strains

747
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,080
The strain on the left is called FR-SERDIAN-A

748
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,640
Then the strain on the right

749
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,060
AR-SIXTIFOR is actually similar to Thai bananas

750
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,700
very popular in Southeast Asia

751
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,620
And it has a very high yield

752
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,220
And you don't really need thinking

753
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,720
resistant

754
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,540
So in almost the whole of Southeast Asia are relying on

755
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,980
They are all planted with the so-called AR-SIXTIFOR strain of rice

756
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,180
The experiment they did was you take these two

757
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,480
These two rice

758
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,700
Soak the whole thing in water, not just the roots

759
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,940
You put the whole spider in the water

760
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,200
After soaking for a week

761
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,340
you take the water away

762
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,640
another week

763
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,640
You can see that this basmati rice is dead

764
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,640
This FR setting A is still peeled well

765
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,760
this is a pity

766
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,840
This FR setting A rice quality is not very good

767
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,640
not very tasty

768
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,040
and it doesn't produce much

769
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,600
So farmers like rice

770
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,840
just intolerable to flooding

771
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,140
In southeast Asia especially in India's Heng River Cape State

772
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,740
And this coal palace smoke water is a major problem

773
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,400
because every time it's summer

774
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,600
it has monshun creek

775
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,300
Just one cigarette lasts for several months

776
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,200
So this is the main question

777
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:55,560
That's at the top of the Heng River in that Nagara

778
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,880
You can see that there is a way

779
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,320
This is their local

780
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,540
and then later cultivated into cultivated roads

781
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,340
Then this is called Deep Waterway

782
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,100
Then you can tell it's oily.

783
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,180
then this is a person

784
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,180
you can see these roads

785
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,180
it can grow taller than a person

786
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,460
Then this Daozi

787
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:23,900
Then your Dao is not a very good cultivation Dao.

788
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,700
Because of its path, if you are planting

789
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,700
this is water

790
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,300
if you drink hookah

791
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,300
it has a reason

792
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,860
It just grows taller than the river

793
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,900
so it always has some leaves

794
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,100
and cloth on the ground on the water

795
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,300
what good is that

796
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,580
Because of the effect of light ears, the silk protection cloth is oxygen

797
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:49,140
So you only need a part of your essence to be on the surface of the water

798
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,740
The effect of the light ear

799
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,940
You can make oxygen and you can make sugar

800
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,180
So you have oxygen attack

801
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,180
Then your silk protection cloth will have oxygen again

802
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,020
so it can be passed to

803
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
so it will live

804
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
But the problem is what to do when the water recedes

805
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
it's because it grows too tall

806
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
it just fell off

807
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You see we grow so short

808
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
makes sense

809
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
because it's going to knot and the knot is heavy

810
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
so it can't grow too tall

811
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And its coldness is very high

812
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It all went through our old ancestors

813
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Cultivated by President Yu

814
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
it's so short

815
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
makes sense

816
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
It can bind so much water

817
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So if this raw water arrives

818
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
When the water recedes, it really falls down.

819
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
its a week or two later

820
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
it starts to grow roots from here again

821
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
The problem is the process of this growth

822
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
its only good thing is that it survives

823
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
let it live not very well

824
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
So it receives very little paper

825
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So you're going to take this as

826
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
its main source words

827
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
not sour

828
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Which means you're unlikely to be able to live off of this

829
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Mongala countries those

830
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
so this is

831
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
The greenhouse of the Agricultural Department of National Taiwan University

832
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
They planted this deep waterway

833
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Then this is to collect water

834
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
That's about four meters tall

835
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
you can see this way

836
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
as long as you have water

837
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
it always grows on the water

838
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It has grown to four meters now

839
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
more than three meters

840
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Then it should have a world record

841
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It seems to be seven or eight meters

842
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
in that

843
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
It's over there in India

844
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
there is a picture of this

845
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
that so

846
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Let's get these crops

847
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
classify a little

848
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
salt water resistant

849
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Afraid of salt water

850
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
then the waterway

851
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
There is also a little bit of salt water

852
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And Sectivo

853
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
then these two

854
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
F-F-Sectivo

855
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And this deep channel

856
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
will sell salt water

857
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
that so

858
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
First

859
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Actually you want

860
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
if you want to leave

861
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
your first question

862
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
That's why different crops

863
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
will have different water resistance

864
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
That's because I'm a teacher

865
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
so i tried this

866
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,920
Today's section is about science

867
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,520
That is to say, it is related to the comparison made by our laboratory.

868
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,800
I hope that means that if this doesn't work out,

869
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,440
It's okay, wait a minute and you can ask me

870
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,640
But I should just keep it really simple

871
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,480
Then all organisms lack oxygen and we need nutrients

872
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,720
Let's rejuvenate

873
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,800
when there is more oxygen

874
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,040
The main source of energy for you and us is from Prado

875
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,920
aerobic respiration

876
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,880
It generates 38 so-called ADPs

877
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,600
That's where our cells' energy comes from

878
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,040
Then if you are hypoxic

879
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,000
into the so-called anaerobic respiration

880
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,960
That one glucose can only produce two ADP

881
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,880
there are two ways

882
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,200
That one is through the so-called lactic acid type

883
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,600
one is alcoholic

884
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,080
Most of all animals have passed through the so-called

885
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,000
Once you are hypoxic

886
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,480
undergoes what is known as lactic acid fermentation

887
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,600
so why are we afraid

888
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,680
That is to say, a stroke in the brain is a lack of oxygen in the brain cells.

889
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,000
why can't it last

890
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,800
because

891
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Animals can only do so-called lactic acid flower effects

892
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
this is sour

893
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
So you suddenly acidify the cytoplasm

894
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
the cell dies

895
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
dead in 20 minutes

896
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
brain cells die

897
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
So why is swelling so severe?

898
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Plants are a little smarter

899
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
It will also take the lactic acid flower effect at the beginning

900
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
But once its cytoplasmic Ph

901
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
to 5.5

902
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It will transform into a flower effect called alcoholic type

903
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Sexualize it with alcohol and it will seep out

904
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Most plant cells can survive in the absence of oxygen

905
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
can live for a while

906
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
So the first biological anoxic

907
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Oxygen free

908
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
always oxygen free

909
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
second word in plant words

910
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
This is a cut surface of the root tip of a hardtail

911
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
This is a normal hardtail tip

912
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
You can see it this one we call Cortic rare

913
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
just very evenly

914
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Cell size is successful

915
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,400
it's about the same and it's tight

916
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,600
Then you take the liquid that has been along the water for 18 hours

917
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,400
you make a cross section of it

918
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
Then you can see that it has many

919
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,680
In fact, this is where the cells die.

920
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,480
that forms a tube

921
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,160
one looks like a big circle

922
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,440
If you look at it, this is the cross section

923
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,080
Then if you fancy the section

924
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,240
This is actually a tube

925
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,280
Then I said before that the action of light will create oxygen

926
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,040
So most plants have this ability

927
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,440
That is to say, once its roots are flooded

928
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,760
it wants to form a trachea

929
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,160
Let it have more oxygen

930
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,880
but the problem is that if the corn

931
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,440
Actually you drown it for 36 hours and it dies

932
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,080
So while corn wants to do this

933
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,960
it's too late

934
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,680
Because when your adversity comes

935
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,760
it's too late for you to do it

936
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,120
That

937
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:56,800
so

938
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,080
but

939
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,280
water arrived

940
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,320
Our strategy says that under normal conditions, you are born with tubular tissue

941
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:13,320
If you cut the root of the water channel, there will be this kind of tubular tissue

942
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:21,600
So it is inherently slightly water-alongable

943
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,640
So why can we, we can put the waterway inside the water

944
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:34,320
But you can’t explain the villager, the FR setting class and the deep water channel

945
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,920
Because all three of them have this ability, all three of them can breathe anaerobically

946
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,960
will also form the tubular tissue

947
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,940
Why is HR60 still not CUT, this FR setting is still CUT

948
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:54,840
This is also very CUT, so the International Waterway Research Center wants to know

949
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,680
Why is this villager different from FR settings? What is the difference between them?

950
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,020
They've been doing it since 1980

951
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,560
sent them 20 years

952
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,340
they finally found that is to say

953
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:10,240
In total five genes are

954
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,040
That is to say, let this FR setting be able to resist flooding

955
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,740
but there is one most important

956
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,940
That is, as long as you have this gene

957
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,240
He's about 80 percent water resistant

958
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,240
But he only knows which one to set

959
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,740
he doesn't know what gene

960
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:32,080
So he has no way to want to be the general manager

961
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,180
At this time, it means that he was born in 2000

962
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,980
It was in 1996

963
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,080
At that time, the so-called wedding paper pre-completion technology

964
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,580
has become very mature

965
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,880
so there are a few

966
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,780
the University of California

967
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,680
Riverside and this

968
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,180
The family background of the two groups of Dennis Marriage School This team

969
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:56,280
It took them five years to find the gene for flood resistance

970
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,820
This flood resistance gene actually

971
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,860
Quite simply, because of the so-called biotechnology

972
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:10,740
Now the so-called molecular domain species actually has several methods

973
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:16,140
Then I will only introduce to you one of the more commonly used methods.

974
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,700
Then the method is, for example, this is you

975
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:26,100
The FR design is also resistant to vaping, but it is not very good at keeping the output low

976
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,440
Then this is the so-called Thai sweet potato

977
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:35,080
It is not resistant to vaping, so it says but it yields very well, and the rice quality is also very good

978
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,660
So what do you most want to do as a field breeder?

979
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,780
Let it go to the end, for example, this is an anti-smoke machine

980
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:49,920
It hopes that in the end it will be planted by your last domain

981
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,200
all its machines

982
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,060
All of them are the Xiangwu machine, except for the smoke-resistant machine

983
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,140
It's Qingben from this anti-smoke water

984
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
This Yanze is actually very simple

985
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,000
You are the first one to compare the flood resistance and non-flood resistance

986
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,300
After hybridization, it will have the so-called

987
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,460
recommendation that recommendation it will exchange chromosomes

988
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,160
Then you can choose from among your offspring

989
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,000
It is flood resistant

990
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,260
after you have this

991
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,500
You can hand it back to this white guy again

992
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,160
If so

993
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:32,320
It will start to replace these blue ones step by step

994
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,460
replace to the end

995
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:37,160
That is to say, you see that you have to recross almost eight times.

996
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,160
you can put other genes

997
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,320
All are the genes of this Thai countryman

998
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,620
Except this is the flood resistance gene

999
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,160
This word in the Lord is very simple

1000
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,320
it's not that easy

1001
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,080
There is no way for them to do the traditional one

1002
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,720
because they have no way of knowing

1003
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,720
Which gene is this

1004
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,480
that do

1005
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,900
With the marriage paper biology, we can have each chromosome

1006
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,600
Find it is what we call a wedding paper label

1007
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,860
So you just do some simple tests

1008
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,020
you will know

1009
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,140
For example, you are a hybrid, you do a few simple tests

1010
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,140
You can know whether your section is blue or white

1011
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:23,360
There is absolutely no way to do this in our traditional way.

1012
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,740
if you don't have so called biotechnology

1013
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:26,900
you can't do it

1014
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,400
It is because of this technology

1015
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,600
They quickly found the technology within five years

1016
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,040
This is from the International Watercourse Organization

1017
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:38,160
the one on their website

1018
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,360
You can see that this channel is twelve chromosomes

1019
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,700
Then this is the FR setting that will resist smoke and water

1020
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,460
You see it's backcrossing and backcrossing a few times

1021
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:51,140
In the end they were like this for two years

1022
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,540
Because Huili Waterfront has three goods a year

1023
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:58,000
So he seriously backcrossed them for two years and they found

1024
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,600
And of course some tests

1025
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,500
After finding this, you can easily find this season because of the molecular mark

1026
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,200
This season so they spent half a year

1027
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,300
This is what they do traditionally

1028
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:19,500
This is the most popular waterway in Mangara

1029
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,500
but afraid of salt water

1030
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,600
This is after salt water

1031
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,000
This is the FR setting class I mentioned earlier.

1032
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,600
this is a hybrid

1033
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,800
You see it backcrossed twice and five times

1034
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,000
It is equal to the result of ten times, you can see it

1035
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,400
it will make it salt water resistant

1036
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,600
This is the so-called molecular domain species

1037
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,800
But it only takes half a year for you to use the genetic modification method

1038
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,400
because they found the gene

1039
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,200
They are called Savwan A

1040
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,900
This gene is in the FR setting class

1041
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,400
Just inside the Thai mud

1042
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,600
Determine if the channel will be salt water resistant

1043
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,000
the gene they found

1044
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,800
Put it in Thai incense mud for half a year

1045
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,000
as you can see it's very resistant to salt water

1046
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,340
Then they, the three of us, they also took our Tainong No. 67

1047
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:08,140
Tainong No. 67 is the most important one in Taiwan

1048
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:11,600
You're on the west coast and most of the east coast

1049
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,040
the one that came out

1050
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,540
That our cultivation way in Taiwan

1051
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,380
They are all descendants of Tainong 67

1052
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,220
Then they are also very afraid of flooding on Tainong 67

1053
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,660
Then they also released the first half

1054
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,300
Natai Nong 67 now also has anti-flooding subsidence

1055
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,900
You can get around at the International Watercourse Organization

1056
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,500
This is because the IHO Research Center is

1057
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,400
A research center under the auspices of the United Nations

1058
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,000
So you need none of these races for money

1059
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,500
means no profit

1060
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,000
That is to say, everyone can

1061
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,900
So actually that means

1062
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,600
They've been doing this for twenty years

1063
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,300
That is, the progress has been rapid in the last five years.

1064
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,400
that is let them just say

1065
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,900
they did some experiments

1066
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,600
Because besides being practical, you

1067
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,400
You now find this Thai township you will resist flooding

1068
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,400
Then let's make some machines

1069
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
why do you want to ask

1070
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Why is he resistant to flooding

1071
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
This FR is set to resist flooding

1072
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Then you will find

1073
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
These strains that are not resistant to flooding

1074
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
when it is flooded

1075
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
it will continue to grow

1076
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
There's a downside to continuing to grow

1077
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
it consumes energy

1078
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
so it quickly puts its

1079
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
That stored nutrient is used up

1080
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
so you flood it a week later

1081
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
you take it out again

1082
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
it dies

1083
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Then this FR setting

1084
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
or your jasmine rice

1085
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Coupled with this anti-flooding machine

1086
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
once you flood it

1087
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
it stops growing

1088
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
It only maintains its most basic metabolism

1089
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Then it saves a lot of energy

1090
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
so once you put it

1091
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
when you flood it

1092
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
You submerge it for another month

1093
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
it won't die yet

1094
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
you take it out again

1095
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
as long as it can continue the action of light

1096
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
it survives again

1097
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
so it's a strategy

1098
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,060
It should be regarded as a magnetic strategy

1099
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:06,900
Even if you use salt water, it will not move, and then it can be replenished for a long time

1100
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,560
Animals also have this disadvantaged strategy, the tortoise

1101
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:14,800
There are some turtles, it can't breathe for a long time

1102
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,740
The main thing about it is that it shuts down almost all of its metabolism

1103
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:23,860
So animals and plants have this Making

1104
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:29,760
Then you have to ask, the deep water channel, it seems that because of its deep water channel, it must not stop

1105
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,940
The deep channel is actually used for this or that

1106
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,500
I think I'll just skip this

1107
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:42,200
The mechanism of the deep channel is just the opposite of this one

1108
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,800
it is

1109
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,300
This FR setting class it is salt water it does not move

1110
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,440
Even if the salt water, this Thai villager who is resistant to salt water is

1111
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,140
It continues to grow, but it doesn't grow fast enough so it can't escape the water

1112
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:59,740
that this

1113
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,500
So the raw water channel will make the giant gas grow, once it is sprayed to flood water, it will grow faster

1114
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:09,260
So when we do molecular biology, we go back and ask

1115
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,160
That is to say, what is the mechanism?

1116
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,860
Then you can know that this research is very good

1117
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:17,500
It uses exactly the same metabolic pathway

1118
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,960
That is to say, this one is its main response when it is flooded.

1119
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,500
There's going to be a residual suction, and then it's going to be a chain of

1120
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:29,500
Then this thorn will make your cells continue to divide, and then continue to grow

1121
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,160
The section in the middle is the road taken by Thai villagers.

1122
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:37,000
That is to say, it does not change, and it will continue to grow when it is flooded, so it is

1123
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:44,600
Then this is set by that FR

1124
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:48,200
The way it goes is that it turns off its own metabolic records

1125
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,700
so it doesn't grow so it survives

1126
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,600
Then its mechanism is to use this growth technology

1127
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,600
it turns it off when it's flooded

1128
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,200
stop plant cells from growing

1129
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,100
flooded to

1130
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,280
It also controls the same metabolic pathway

1131
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,340
it just turned upside down

1132
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:09,140
It allows this growth technique to produce more

1133
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:11,640
It makes more when it's flooded

1134
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,580
so you can tell

1135
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,040
The place where the evolution temple is

1136
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:20,580
In the same way, if you correct it and correct it, the effect will be the same.

1137
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,080
are flood-resistant waterways

1138
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:26,380
So doing this kind of experiment is very rewarding

1139
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,160
because you have practical value

1140
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,120
because you can improve that is

1141
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:35,700
Now the rice is already in the ashes of the populace

1142
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,660
It should be released next year

1143
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:41,360
The Mengala strain I mentioned earlier

1144
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,100
It will also be promoted in Mongara

1145
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:47,000
How local farmers grow

1146
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,240
The most important thing is this pre-made rice

1147
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,280
Its yield and quality are the same as those of the original strain.

1148
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,920
They have been experimenting for three years

1149
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:55,980
know now

1150
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,140
So this gift is

1151
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
have a practical use

1152
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
but in science

1153
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
You mean in basic research

1154
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
You also get a great deal

1155
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
because of this

1156
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
just to let you know this

1157
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
so-called molecular mechanisms

1158
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That's what we do

1159
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
The problems that basic researchers are doing

1160
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
so maybe

1161
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
then you can ask

1162
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Then we can not use this technology

1163
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
to make a super channel

1164
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
For example, if you start from the natural

1165
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
inside wild road

1166
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
or various materials

1167
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
it has this

1168
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
For example, it looks very tax-heavy

1169
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
And it looks so big on you

1170
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
And it's anti-algorithm

1171
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
or smoke resistant

1172
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
it's being done now

1173
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
It uses this molecular labeling method

1174
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
take it

1175
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
want to put it

1176
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
That is to say it delivers this

1177
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
one

1178
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
for example for example

1179
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Our Tainong No. 67

1180
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Maybe we'll go both ways in the future

1181
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
If this method

1182
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
then you can just say

1183
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,440
Opponents of GMOs probably you can reach a goose shoe

1184
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,200
Because this method you don't use the base modification

1185
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,640
Although your end result is exactly the same

1186
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,400
But this is not every crop you can do

1187
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,280
because you want to do this

1188
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,680
First of all, you have to have a lot of what we call seed relationship

1189
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,840
So why is biodiversity so important?

1190
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,720
because you want to see what sex

1191
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,040
you must have this gene

1192
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,000
In this species you have this gene

1193
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,840
You can use this method

1194
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,200
if you don't

1195
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,840
For example, the bananas you mentioned earlier

1196
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,480
It doesn't have such a good relationship at all, what should you do?

1197
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,400
Then your GM crops are the only way

1198
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:48,960
So to say this from my point of view is to say

1199
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,440
If it means that the genetic modification is not genetic modification

1200
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,400
Up to now, I personally think that it is not a scientific problem.

1201
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,920
It's about political issues

1202
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,960
that is

1203
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,260
That is to say, the problem of acceptance in our society

1204
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,380
We scientists are responsible for this

1205
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,380
We need to talk to the public

1206
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:12,300
That is, if we could have more conversations with that

1207
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:16,580
Just face this method with an honest attitude of comparison

1208
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:20,300
Maybe it means that some of our future crops

1209
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,700
We can use sense to change

1210
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,960
Some of you will feel that this technique is

1211
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,100
Then of course we use the words of this so-called molecular art

1212
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,100
that's it

1213
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,020
seems to mean

1214
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:39,900
This biotechnology can be used in this respect

1215
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,820
Then I am now at the end of my person, that is to say

1216
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:47,460
In fact, I have been in the US for 30 years and only came back in 2008

1217
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,700
Then I have been in the past almost 4 years

1218
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:54,220
That is to say, we have direct contact with Taiwan's agricultural sector

1219
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,460
Then the following is my personal opinion

1220
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:00,020
I think it means that our biotechnology can be used in

1221
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Our government actually sees the importance of this biotechnology

1222
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So he proposed the so-called six emerging industries

1223
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
There is the so-called golden agriculture and the biotechnology industry, the strength industry

1224
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
This is more or less related to agricultural biotechnology

1225
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Our government has also created an interministerial so-called Agricultural Biotechnology Advancement Program

1226
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
There is a goal in this plan

1227
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,000
In fact, want to help our country's economy

1228
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,000
That is to say, to increase the output value of the agricultural biotechnology industry

1229
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
but of course it's important

1230
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
But is biotechnology only used once?

1231
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Then I think there is another aspect of biotechnology besides this.

1232
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
important task

1233
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,440
this task is

1234
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,760
Because of the problems we face in Taiwan's agriculture

1235
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,080
It's not a matter of value

1236
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,320
Because of your agricultural bioindustry

1237
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,280
You will never your output value will never exceed the electronics industry

1238
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,920
But it's actually more important than that

1239
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:22,640
There are so-called economists in our country

1240
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,560
That is to say, in that because of the rice

1241
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,840
The problem of subsidizing farmers

1242
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,880
Need to say that rice is so cheap

1243
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,160
So cheap, just import them all

1244
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,160
we don't plant

1245
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,600
This sounds a little bit

1246
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,040
Yes Just Say About the Basic Concepts of Food Security

1247
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,960
Economist who knows nothing

1248
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,680
because the world think about it

1249
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,760
So rice is not a problem of greedy cats

1250
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,680
not a commodity

1251
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,040
Everyone, think about it, is there a country in the world?

1252
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,720
Said to grow rice for sale

1253
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,000
rice to sell

1254
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,640
You can't find it. Countries around the world are successful in producing rice, so it is sold to other countries

1255
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:13,220
No country says that I specialize in selling rice, and the United States specializes in selling corn, and it doesn’t need to love corn

1256
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:21,000
Because the corn it exports is not for food, it is eaten when it loses all, and the corn in it is used for other purposes

1257
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:27,500
So soybeans are also this and that, but rice is not a commodity

1258
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:34,500
Once you say that there are some factors that affect the rice production, now Thailand will take it back and it will not export

1259
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:42,000
So we don’t want to grow rice in Taiwan because it doesn’t know about food security.

1260
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:50,700
That is to say, there is also this TU change at this level, so I will talk about these two

1261
01:00:50,700 --> 01:01:00,100
As for the sustainable use, I think President Wang Wu just said that our middle camp will probably slow down. In fact, we are already doing it, and we will do it in the future.

1262
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,600
Let's just expand this area

1263
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,600
Then why do I say that food security is very important

1264
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,960
Because Taiwan's food independence was in 2008

1265
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,760
About 32% to 33%

1266
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,100
So far this year, 30% of it has been determined

1267
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:16,120
shares

1268
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,180
Don't say we have enough water

1269
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,480
We import a lot of stocks

1270
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,020
use it for other purposes

1271
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,340
We now have less than 30% of our autonomy

1272
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,400
world

1273
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:28,920
Europe

1274
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:29,700
U.S.

1275
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:30,980
they subsidize their farmers

1276
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:31,500
kind

1277
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:32,260
grow grain

1278
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,560
we subsidize our farmers

1279
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:35,340
don't plant

1280
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:37,900
Nasyune

1281
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:39,180
don't want

1282
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,980
Don’t think that pruning roots is cultivating land

1283
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,780
After a long time of pruning

1284
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,060
where you will

1285
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,100
would be useless

1286
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,640
because no one to take care of

1287
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,440
you will have soon

1288
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,980
yes there is that

1289
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:55,040
The quality of the soil will become very poor

1290
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,340
and this

1291
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,660
The other one is that many of us

1292
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,340
The excellent agricultural land becomes what I call a dog house in Yilan

1293
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:15,500
It's like a farmhouse, a small farmhouse that even dogs can't live in.

1294
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,500
Our farmland is constantly being lost

1295
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:24,800
The worst thing is that Taiwan is not a miscellaneous grain that cannot be grown

1296
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,500
we had twenty years ago

1297
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:32,700
But because Taiwan's land chick Yale replaced our miscellaneous grains with corn and soybeans, we needed special varieties.

1298
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:36,700
All the people we pre-planted are lost because our government does not plant them ourselves

1299
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,700
Those of us who preseeded are all lost

1300
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:48,000
Then you have to turn back and say that now because the feed is very expensive, we are now saying that we will start growing our own grains

1301
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,600
We need to retrain our pre-seeds not those of us who do molecular biology

1302
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:57,600
It’s about pre-planting in the front. We don’t have these skills. Most of the people who don’t have high school

1303
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,600
And everyone is in their seventies now

1304
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,700
So it will increase, this is our food security

1305
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:08,100
Because once you have any situation that affects food production

1306
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:11,980
Let's not look at such a low production value

1307
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:14,500
You can survive without a computer

1308
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,500
I don't have rice to eat, I'll see what to do

1309
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:20,100
So food security is a big problem for Taiwan's agriculture

1310
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:23,300
Another company not far away

1311
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:28,300
Everyone thinks maybe it means softening for 100 years

1312
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,900
only increase a degree or two

1313
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,900
Will it really affect agriculture?

1314
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:35,900
So I'm also asking this question

1315
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,900
So I'm asking this question now

1316
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:41,900
Will corporate changes really affect Taiwan's crops?

1317
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:47,900
The first one is that I have tweeted with many farmers in Taiwan.

1318
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,900
There are also many agricultural transformation factories in Taiwan

1319
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,900
They are directly lower limit and farmers

1320
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:54,900
Our rice has three major diseases

1321
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,500
white leaf mushroom disease

1322
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,500
Dao Le disease

1323
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,500
The other one is called dragon mushroom disease

1324
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,500
Dragon mushroom disease has no effect

1325
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
There is no medicine, but it is relatively rare in Taiwan

1326
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,500
There are medicines for Bai Ye Gu's disease and Dao Le's disease

1327
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:10,500
But our farmers often spray pesticides until they pass out

1328
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,500
It's because of the medicine they're going to spill

1329
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,000
these two

1330
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
We have some strains in Taiwan

1331
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,500
It is the strain introduced from Taiwan 67 Medicine

1332
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,000
against certain bacteria

1333
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,500
So our farms and factories have their tasks

1334
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,500
just to tell the farmers

1335
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,500
For example, which strain of rice do you want to plant in the next few years?

1336
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,500
You can compare against Dowle's disease

1337
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,500
Comparable against white night disease

1338
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,500
They told me it seems like the last ten years

1339
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,500
I said before that you promote a strain

1340
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,500
about ten years

1341
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,500
They feel that the past ten years

1342
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,500
That is to say, this cycle is getting shorter and shorter

1343
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,500
their speculation is that

1344
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,500
Because of the increase in average temperature

1345
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:54,500
The speed of this evolution is accelerated

1346
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,500
is this real

1347
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,500
so you're going to explore this

1348
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,900
another this problem is very serious, because no one will do it for us

1349
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:13,300
Because Taiwan is here, this is the dimension of the Yangtze River

1350
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:19,200
All the countries south of the Yangtze River speak the second language, called Indica

1351
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:23,800
Because it is a subtropical species

1352
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:28,760
The strain north of the Yangtze River is considered to be a relatively temperate strain, called Japongi

1353
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:34,040
Taiwan was occupied by the Japanese for 50 years, so the Japanese developed a

1354
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:40,960
This strain of red rice means that we are a large temperate species in a subtropical country

1355
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:46,600
If you grow like this, your germs will be completely different from others

1356
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:52,000
That is to say, Professor Wang Qiangsheng of Chung Hsing University

1357
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,960
He introduced 21 strains from the International Waterway Center, which are resistant to 21 kinds of bacteria

1358
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,840
The farm collects the bacteria of white leaf mushroom disease from all over Taiwan

1359
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,160
he took three whole parties

1360
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,640
including eleven none

1361
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,360
Three fungi of white leaf mushroom disease in Taiwan

1362
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,720
Then we sequence the three bacteria

1363
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,640
I found out that you use this Pingtung as the boundary condition

1364
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,040
The east comes from the Philippines

1365
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:25,000
The west side is more similar to Japan and South Korea

1366
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,680
But he has evolved his own set of chances of healing

1367
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,840
so we don't do it ourselves

1368
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,880
no one will do it for you

1369
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,160
Because our bacteria are different from others

1370
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,720
So now Professor Wang Qiangsen uses this

1371
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,040
With Tailong No. 67, he gave it to

1372
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:45,360
Give someone to find out who can resist

1373
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:48,800
Rice strains of white leaf mushroom disease in Taiwan

1374
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,400
then we are doing this now

1375
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,960
So this has something to do with the warming

1376
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,800
Because you if the experiment we're doing right now is

1377
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,040
The past ten years collected by our farm

1378
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,500
Designed GIRL from all over Taiwan

1379
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,840
we are now working with them

1380
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,460
Every year we also collect GIRL in the same place

1381
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,460
we can see how fast it evolves

1382
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:12,420
It can prove that the climate becomes warmer

1383
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:18,760
Will it affect the acceleration of the evolution of bacteria?

1384
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:22,840
So I think I'll tell you the answer in 10 years

1385
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:29,960
The second time you are blooming and bearing fruit in the waterway

1386
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,460
If you are too hot

1387
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,460
it turned out to be an empty bomb

1388
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:38,260
It will affect the quality of its rice grain

1389
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,760
Everyone, when you go to the market to buy

1390
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,760
This is what you should buy

1391
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:43,760
each one is transparent

1392
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,260
This is normal

1393
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:47,260
It is a waterway with high nutritional value

1394
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,260
Have you seen many of these

1395
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:54,180
opaque we call them agronomists

1396
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,180
This is called a heart guard

1397
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:57,180
This is from an empty bomb.

1398
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:59,180
Then this is when you are blooming

1399
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,640
During the so-called development period you experience abnormal temperatures

1400
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,160
you will affect the outcome

1401
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,040
So they have a system to determine that

1402
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,100
The quality of rice grains

1403
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:20,480
Therefore, high temperature will also affect the quality of rice grains.

1404
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,040
another output

1405
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:29,960
The director of the aspect center of our middle school

1406
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,840
Liu Shaocheng did a string experiment

1407
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,680
Over the past few decades in Taiwan

1408
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:43,320
Our high temperature average

1409
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:45,880
Little change in Taiwan but one thing

1410
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,440
our evening

1411
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:50,740
temperature increase

1412
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,080
Ip Man's increase rate is much higher than other countries

1413
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,680
The other is the temperature difference between day and night.

1414
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,020
The temperature difference also becomes smaller

1415
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:04,040
because it's hot at night

1416
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,880
The words of plants play a role in the daytime

1417
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,520
At night, only respiration

1418
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,620
if your temperature is too high

1419
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:11,520
it breathes

1420
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:15,920
In theory, it should be higher

1421
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:20,420
This will affect its output

1422
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,760
International Rice Organization in the Philippines

1423
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,840
they did the experiment

1424
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,540
in their laboratory

1425
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:34,600
If you find that your average temperature at night has increased by one degree

1426
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,040
10% reduction in production

1427
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,840
Taiwan over the past 100 years

1428
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:42,180
Our average leaf temperature is two degrees

1429
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,340
Did you say it affected the output?

1430
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,440
There is no experimental proof

1431
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:51,400
But I am from the Agricultural Department of National Taiwan University

1432
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,000
The Times Received by Mr. Lu Sen

1433
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:59,800
Only ours is 9599697

1434
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,900
We rice this is our project goal

1435
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:06,740
This is our actual output

1436
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,800
You can see the goal of our project

1437
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:13,540
Much lower than our actual output

1438
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:16,540
He estimated the goal of the plan

1439
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,800
It means how much area we will plant this year

1440
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,840
So we expect that under normal conditions

1441
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,200
how much output should he have

1442
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,600
You see two consecutive years

1443
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,900
In fact, his newer data keeps falling

1444
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:32,300
Is it affected by Ye Wen?

1445
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:36,360
Elevated leaf temperature affects rice yield

1446
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:40,100
Maybe but that's all we need to ask

1447
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,960
So our concentrated environment in Taiwan

1448
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,260
Rice is not the only problem faced

1449
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:50,260
Most concentrates face the same problem

1450
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:56,460
Because global warming will cause high temperature

1451
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:58,260
For example, its average temperature increases

1452
01:10:58,260 --> 01:10:59,280
Increased leaf temperature

1453
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,600
The temperature difference decreases, and the other is the increase in extreme climate

1454
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,120
It means that you have more days with strong wind and heavy rain

1455
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:13,240
So the plant was originally living in its original climate

1456
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,600
it has some adaptability

1457
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,000
It is now due to environmental changes

1458
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:21,200
Because the most important thing about Taiwan is that our terrain is very special

1459
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:28,240
So some changes are completely different from continental country changes

1460
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,680
So we also hit the steel shore and we go along the water

1461
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:37,080
There are other issues such as the use of oxygen temperature and water smoke

1462
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:41,600
This is the standard that our crops face

1463
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,320
What about you

1464
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:48,480
The first one I think is someone who does biotechnology

1465
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:52,160
This is a very important question

1466
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,600
In addition to the previous biotechnology industry, which is of course important

1467
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,600
and that we can definitely do

1468
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,440
For example, that we already know how to do

1469
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,600
This is certainly worth pursuing

1470
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,000
Are we facing this problem

1471
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,640
I think our government is probably starting to think

1472
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:08,960
that's them

1473
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:18,520
The year 2010 is the main direction of the agricultural science and technology forward-looking issue that was set last year.

1474
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:22,320
You can see that I listed a few that are now out.

1475
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,880
It's on their government radar

1476
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:30,720
This is why agricultural biotechnology also needs to face these problems

1477
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,440
This CCTV safety food safety

1478
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:38,000
This promotion of the farmer's beard probably means

1479
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,200
It's not just scientists

1480
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,760
This should be the whole

1481
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,760
That is to say, no matter what the social humanities and economics

1482
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,680
And this job, I think everyone should come in.

1483
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,600
and these few

1484
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:58,040
And this so-called sustainable utilization of production resources

1485
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,680
As far as we're concerned, you do what you can

1486
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:10,400
Because you seem to be talking about problems now, do you have any countermeasures?

1487
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:18,000
Then I think the first one is you, because the research we have been doing is actually very simple

1488
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,320
In fact, I am working along the water

1489
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:24,000
So what we do is very simple, what to do when you lack oxygen

1490
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:31,200
But now the plants in this field face not only flooding

1491
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:35,200
It is faced because usually Taiwan flooding is down

1492
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:39,200
So it usually faces high temperature and lack of oxygen

1493
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:44,000
Few people do this, and most people do experiments in the laboratory at a temperature of more than 20 degrees.

1494
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,000
So the results of the experiment we did, if you want to go to the field to do it, probably most of it won't be needed

1495
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,200
So those of us who do basic research have to come back and ask questions in different ways

1496
01:13:55,200 --> 01:14:00,000
That is to say, if you see the environment changes now, then you know the problems you may face

1497
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,300
we're going to find out

1498
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:07,400
For example, can you train this to warm the predictions of the two lipid groups?

1499
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:10,900
Well, this should actually be a big challenge.

1500
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:13,640
Because you are not only afraid of the heat

1501
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:19,840
Are you still afraid of the difference between its night temperature and day temperature?

1502
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,540
That's a problem we've never faced before.

1503
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:28,800
Then there are ice insect moxa, Huang Zhiying, water, and sheep adjustment

1504
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,400
It seems that I haven't mentioned this all the time.

1505
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,900
But it's actually a serious problem

1506
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,000
water

1507
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,700
We all complain that this industrial age uses up a lot of water

1508
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:44,400
Taiwan's agricultural water use is also very serious

1509
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,700
they also use a lot of water

1510
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,000
Do you think water is needed?

1511
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:51,900
You grow water so much that it actually lives well without water

1512
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:56,600
Planting water is because you plant it in water because it has

1513
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,300
It can mean that you can grow weeds

1514
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,100
and that one

1515
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,540
Canals can survive without water

1516
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,540
It's just that it may not be very productive

1517
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:11,040
So now at the Center for International Waterways Research in the Philippines

1518
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:16,340
They're starting to breed a new generation of waterway seeds

1519
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:21,540
is that you use what they call Dry Cartigation

1520
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:23,240
It is to be planted in the sweat field

1521
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,260
This is totally different from before

1522
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:27,060
Because if you want to sweat, you can't make a difference

1523
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:28,260
also use fools

1524
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,420
So besides cultivation techniques, you

1525
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:32,760
you have a new breed

1526
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,800
You can still grow well that way

1527
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,000
We in Taiwan, I think we should also go this way

1528
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,200
Because for example, if we use water for your waterways

1529
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,500
don't take that long

1530
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,400
For example, you don't want two and a half months

1531
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,200
If you only let it last a month

1532
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,440
Then save the water for three minutes

1533
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:53,640
see what happens

1534
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,800
I want to do research on this

1535
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,300
none of us are doing it yet

1536
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,440
This needs to be done in the Tenriya

1537
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:08,240
So these are the ones we should develop

1538
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,840
There is also the so-called resistance to adversity

1539
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:15,040
So one of our current ideas is

1540
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:19,840
We are tantamount to using biotechnology

1541
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,040
we are not relying on the original

1542
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:26,240
Because of these environmental factors caused by the current environmental changes

1543
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:29,640
Some plants have never been touched

1544
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,600
So you have these sources

1545
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,360
That is to say, you have to go to the wild to find wild species.

1546
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:37,080
It may be difficult to resist

1547
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:41,760
The best thing we should do now is to use this so-called biotechnology method

1548
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:46,720
to create to create these various strains

1549
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:51,880
Then we have an early warning

1550
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,480
Early warning and monitoring system

1551
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,680
For example, we can predict the next ten years

1552
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,080
maybe not now

1553
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,800
Maybe what will happen to our Taiwanese companies in the next few years

1554
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:08,500
We can generalize this kind of system that we have experienced

1555
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:11,880
This is of course in the planning stage.

1556
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,500
but we already have teams that want to start doing their own thing

1557
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:19,300
So I think this should be what I'm going to explain today.

1558
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:23,200
I think the role of the Academia Sinica in the field of agricultural biotechnology

1559
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,000
I think we have quite a few really good research energy

1560
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,200
Also has various expertise

1561
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:34,700
See the main direction of these our forward-looking topics right ahead of us

1562
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:41,200
I think our Academia Sinica should have at least these aspects

1563
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,400
we all have strengths

1564
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:49,200
In fact, we have been doing it since last year.

1565
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:54,200
Let's say it combines the Agricultural College of National Taiwan University

1566
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:58,700
There is also our Agricultural Center and we have a teacher in the post office

1567
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,200
Then another economics student

1568
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
We set up a big research team

1569
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Just to do what I said earlier

1570
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
there is

1571
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
This is the goal of our research

1572
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,000
We also recently communicated with the International Water University Research Center

1573
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Signed one is Number 2, etc.

1574
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
By our COA students

1575
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
come to do research team

1576
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
We are also research team

1577
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
We are also research team

1578
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Signed one is Number 2, etc.

1579
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
by our Council of Agriculture

1580
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
That is to say, put some sutras

1581
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
IWU Research Center

1582
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Then our scientists in Taiwan

1583
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
You can go over there to do experiments

1584
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
means we get there

1585
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
you can use this money

1586
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
separated from the scientists there

1587
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Then this is actually a

1588
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
that is not easy

1589
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
That is to say, it is actually quite an important achievement.

1590
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Because the research center of the International Water University

1591
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
an organization under the United Nations

1592
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
that said earlier

1593
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
The previous president, the previous president was

1594
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,000
He doesn't dare to formally communicate with Taiwan whatever the Chinese mainland says.

1595
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:15,000
A German was changed as president last year

1596
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Then you are willing to formally sign NHR with us

1597
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,000
So our scientists in Taiwan can start now

1598
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
That is not only we have a team

1599
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
There is a formal cooperation contract

1600
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
They also see that Academia Sinica has resources

1601
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
So they are also willing to cooperate

1602
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,000
We hope that at least in the next five or ten years

1603
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,000
We can contribute in addition to the Academia Sinica in the biotechnology industry

1604
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
We prefer to face the

1605
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
the problems he faced in agriculture

1606
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Because it's actually a really big challenge

1607
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
We hope we can have some contribution

1608
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
then i think i'll stop here today

1609
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Thanks

1610
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:06,640
Thank you Mayor for your wonderful speech

1611
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:11,260
We have some time to open up your questions

1612
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:14,340
Do you want to ask him for advice?

1613
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:18,680
Mayor

1614
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,240
I listen to talk and I have an association

1615
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,320
We will also talk about the excavation of health food later.

1616
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,880
Taiwan now our civilian clothes

1617
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,180
Many peasant children including me

1618
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:32,500
Don't eat rice that isn't farmed

1619
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,180
Afraid of fat

1620
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:35,900
so many of us now

1621
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,380
don't eat rice at all

1622
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:39,940
So our colorectal cancer

1623
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:42,340
Already senior for three years

1624
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:45,380
Are we the technology method you mentioned just now?

1625
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:47,100
can put this rice

1626
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:49,140
Our electric paper

1627
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:52,460
that saccharification

1628
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:54,260
Carbohydrate or reduce

1629
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:56,820
that keeps it nourished

1630
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:59,380
Like what you said just now, people will be able to promote that

1631
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,740
buy them extra high

1632
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,740
Then encourage people to eat rice

1633
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,200
You can also check this

1634
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:06,140
Dachanghai

1635
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:08,300
The proportion of Dachanghai is a little bit higher

1636
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,840
The average amount of rice our people eat is

1637
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:13,500
It just happens to be more successful than

1638
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:14,900
fall again every year

1639
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,640
Dachanghai is increased every year

1640
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,400
is this possible

1641
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:21,440
this i think

1642
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:25,100
In theory it should be possible

1643
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:25,940
but i think

1644
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,740
This Taiwan eats rice

1645
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:30,180
reduce i think

1646
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:33,540
not only because

1647
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:34,380
is the relationship between rice

1648
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:34,880
but

1649
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:35,980
That is because you are economical

1650
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:37,880
Development now means diversification

1651
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:38,280
That

1652
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:40,380
I'm different

1653
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:41,380
that

1654
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:42,480
that

1655
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:43,840
Xianghua

1656
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:44,380
because

1657
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:46,280
us

1658
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:49,240
the reason why m said

1659
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,980
Also in Taiwan

1660
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:52,440
that can't mean

1661
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:54,980
we start over

1662
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:55,540
eat

1663
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:56,280
means you come back

1664
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,280
It is still enough for us to maintain the amount of rice we used to eat

1665
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,920
that's where we put you

1666
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,260
The use of rice makes it diversified

1667
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:06,200
Then why can English be used as fodder?

1668
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:10,760
Why can't this text be used as fodder?

1669
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,540
So now the Council of Agriculture also has

1670
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:14,640
they don't like to use the word

1671
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:21,000
That is to say, to develop another batch of

1672
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,020
Don't spend so much effort planting

1673
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:25,080
That rice can be used as fodder

1674
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,400
Taiwan imports a lot every year

1675
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:30,160
Encourage it to be used as feed

1676
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,300
so this is

1677
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,440
Maybe doesn't directly answer your question

1678
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:35,900
You said you want to change the rice

1679
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,500
i think probably

1680
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,900
if someone does

1681
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:39,900
should be fine

1682
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:43,740
but I use another way

1683
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:47,940
I think you can use it in other ways

1684
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:50,740
Because we spent a lot of foreign exchange

1685
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:52,600
importing this carrier

1686
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,900
And most people make feed outside

1687
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,700
Now the Council of Agriculture has finally remembered

1688
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:00,000
So do they want someone now?

1689
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Hearing this word, this is called feed rice

1690
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
They eat with people because of this, they want to share the fun

1691
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
OK, thank you

1692
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I would like to ask the host that

1693
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Food is a global problem

1694
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I always wanted to start with that green biotech

1695
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I want to ask if there is such a concept

1696
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:24,000
The one that uses the animal to join its photosynthesis

1697
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
that possibility

1698
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
animals directly form photosynthesis

1699
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
like this

1700
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I think it might be a bit difficult

1701
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Because it photosynthesizes it has

1702
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,000
In fact, the source of its gene is two sets

1703
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
A set is from real and biological

1704
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,000
The other set is the continuation of the photosynthesis

1705
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
so you just say

1706
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:55,000
This should be counted as the fainting of animals and plants.

1707
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
It should be a billion

1708
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
so i think you have to be in

1709
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,760
It's kind of hard to change the consequences of this evolution right now

1710
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,760
but you never say

1711
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,960
That means we have glow fish, glow pigs

1712
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,760
Are we talking about the possibility of this direction

1713
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,760
Fluorescent fish is actually very simple

1714
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,960
it's just a gene

1715
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,960
fluorescent protein

1716
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,960
that is very simple

1717
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,160
Your role of light is the whole package

1718
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,160
That's the white gene

1719
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:27,280
that might be a bit difficult

1720
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,280
But this scientific progress

1721
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,280
I will give an example

1722
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,480
When we used to do DNA sequencing

1723
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,000
in my time

1724
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,040
If you set a preface, it will be a very good PayPal

1725
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,040
Some people graduate with an order

1726
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:49,040
When doing the sequencing of the human genome

1727
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,160
the god with a golden frog

1728
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:54,640
is the discovery of the great Boiri

1729
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,640
He said why do you want to make this order?

1730
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,800
He said that this sequencing technology

1731
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,800
even a monkey can do it

1732
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,240
At that time, it has progressed to only 20 years

1733
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:08,440
Then if you compare now with that of 20 years ago

1734
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,440
About 1000 times better

1735
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,320
So that technique has bad speed

1736
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:16,320
Probably not at least 1000 times

1737
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,520
It may be ten thousand times more

1738
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,320
So I will say No to your question

1739
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,320
但You never know

1740
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:23,320
OK

1741
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:28,520
thank you for his speech today

1742
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:29,840
What I would like to ask is

1743
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,840
It was mentioned at the beginning

1744
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,440
Swiss scientist would love to share his name

1745
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:37,120
But there are some companies that he has patents and refuses to

1746
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,440
It is also mentioned that Monsanto has many

1747
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,160
These related patents

1748
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,440
But just now it was said that the international bandit democrats

1749
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:46,320
He'd love to open up all his bandit comments

1750
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,600
I feel like the attitude is completely different

1751
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:51,440
I also heard that there is a kind of service patent in the United States.

1752
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:54,880
Does that mean Taiwan is in this entire future crisis?

1753
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,240
Shouldn't this be the way to protect yourself?

1754
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,960
Or it should not be completely open.

1755
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:14,000
There is one thing about this, you are beyond my ability, but I can tell you that when the ordering began in the early days, many individuals or companies patented their series, and they were all approved at that time.

1756
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:25,000
But now you only need to challenge the invalidation of those patents, because now it is what you want, you only have to sequence, that is just an information, this is useless,

1757
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I think at least in our Taiwan, that is to say, the International Rice Organization, it made it, it was pre-planted, because it is an international organization, so it does not need that,

1758
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:45,000
And it didn't use it, it didn't use the so-called fonts, that is, patented ones, but I think we need to develop in Taiwan, of course we need patents,

1759
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:59,000
But it is used to protect ourselves, the example of Mr. Hong is very good, and our central government is also very patented, but we can be endless, that is, we don’t reward those who need tools. I think this is what we need.

1760
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I must collect his money

1761
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Because Jin Ming is courageous, Jin Ming belongs to Mengshan

1762
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
The one with the most rice gene patents is also Mengshan's

1763
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
So one day we must challenge his patents

1764
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Because he is only sequenced

1765
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:20,000
I think this Faguo company has its own commercial considerations

1766
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
But I guess we're scientists

1767
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
It's you, you have to take the exam yourself

1768
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
But our country's industrial view

1769
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Or the point of view that you will solve the problem in the future

1770
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
i think i have to protect myself

1771
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
sorry

1772
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
But teacher, you just said that

1773
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
If Meng Shandu develops faster

1774
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
he got the patent

1775
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Then we can't develop any more.

1776
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Mengshantou's products are not the same

1777
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
He invented it himself

1778
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
he sold it

1779
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
His RUNUP was not invented by him

1780
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
He studied from one university to another in New Jersey

1781
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Buy him from that person

1782
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Tell him to buy SPRS

1783
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,020
It's not his picture, their own research and development is not so powerful

1784
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:10,200
Because you are him in March

1785
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:13,360
Because I personally do basic research

1786
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,760
If you do a research, you set a goal at the beginning

1787
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,760
I must solve this problem

1788
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,920
often only ten to eighty nine you will not succeed

1789
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:32,020
You can click, thank you teacher

1790
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:34,020
It's okay, teacher, I should be old enough

1791
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:37,020
i think because i am a middle school teacher

1792
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:39,020
Then every time I come to listen to the middle school speech

1793
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:42,020
I think they will bring a lot of things back to the students in our school

1794
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:46,020
It's like in the future high school curriculum

1795
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:49,020
biotechnology, there is an applied biotechnology is to explore

1796
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:52,020
Give the teacher some examples of what you mentioned today

1797
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:54,020
So I am very happy to come here to take classes

1798
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:56,020
You can bring many examples back to share

1799
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:58,020
I'll take a look now

1800
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:00,040
Please go back and share more examples

1801
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,840
In the past few years, I have actually listened to many courses on plant essence transplantation.

1802
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,000
course for teachers

1803
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,200
So one thing I want to ask is

1804
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,360
Teacher, what you mentioned at the beginning is

1805
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,640
In the domestic part in Taiwan

1806
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:15,040
In principle, we are not allowed to

1807
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,900
Changed some crops

1808
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:17,960
Whether it's rice

1809
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,800
Or what I heard at National Taiwan University

1810
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:20,840
Sweet potato is also good

1811
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:22,600
Or the tomato you just mentioned

1812
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:23,920
The application of stone mustard

1813
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:25,640
It's like what the teacher just said

1814
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:28,800
You want to address a lot of rice productivity decline

1815
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,600
issues related to climate change

1816
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,200
In the future, if you really

1817
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,680
when something like this is produced

1818
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:36,200
Isn't it going to be used in Taiwan?

1819
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,240
Then you are the first policy and you will get stuck

1820
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,520
the second one i think

1821
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,640
It just so happens that the deputy dean is also here.

1822
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:42,560
I don't know you

1823
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,400
it's you officers

1824
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,000
Is there a way to provide some input

1825
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,960
How can I convince students in the future

1826
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,960
especially interested in biotechnology

1827
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:53,320
Students who want to engage in precision transplantation and application

1828
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:55,160
I won't go in after this one

1829
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:57,680
It's great when it's done and it comes out for one thing

1830
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:58,680
I also want to help Taiwanese

1831
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:00,120
But I'm not in Taiwan

1832
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
room for development

1833
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:02,520
Here are the two questions I want to ask

1834
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:03,180
Thanks

1835
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:05,760
ok the first question is not

1836
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:11,200
i think it should be soon

1837
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,760
Our Council of Agriculture has already contacted the Department of Health

1838
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,760
have already formulated these

1839
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,560
That is to say, genetically modified crops are pre-tests

1840
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:22,320
and safety assessments and food safety assessments

1841
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,120
This policy is all here

1842
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:25,840
The next stage is to say

1843
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,760
Do you want quasi-GM crops to go on the market?

1844
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:36,040
I want to say that after all these years of discussion

1845
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,360
my prediction is

1846
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,440
In the beginning, it was likely that the main Taiwanese

1847
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,280
I don't think the water is right

1848
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:47,560
But the others, especially the Fahui

1849
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:50,200
It should be right, just like a fluorescent fish

1850
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:53,640
So I think the main thing is

1851
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,200
This is not just a Taiwan problem

1852
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,800
In Europe, genetically modified crops are not allowed to be

1853
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,800
So let the Americans rule the world

1854
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,700
that this but you too I guess it's a comparison

1855
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:07,500
This is tantamount to being a member of politics and society

1856
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:11,500
Then I'm not that desperate

1857
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,500
i think it should

1858
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:16,700
That is to say, you, especially I think we scientists also have a part of our responsibility

1859
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:20,900
Because when we go out to talk to that, that is to say, society, this is

1860
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:23,500
The one who is equal to the dialogue is not so enthusiastic

1861
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:27,700
I think this is you Taiwan is a democratic country

1862
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:31,500
You want a policy, this is actually a pretty big policy

1863
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:35,300
I think you should just say

1864
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:38,700
Although I know I know it's a good thing

1865
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:41,700
But you still have to be able to convince the society

1866
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:44,200
Most of the general public will accept you as this

1867
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,900
Then I think Taiwan can be smart

1868
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:49,200
I think you have a conversation that should work out

1869
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:52,700
And our government should say they

1870
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:55,900
At least two years ago the attitude started

1871
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:58,900
I was talking about that at the beginning

1872
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:00,900
the constitutional one

1873
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
The chairman of the Council of Agriculture and the chairman of the vice-chairman Cai Bing will not

1874
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
now that is to say

1875
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Because their considerations are not scientific objections at all.

1876
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
but political considerations

1877
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
I think this can be resolved through dialogue.

1878
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
should come

1879
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
I think most of the regulations are already in the Executive Yuan

1880
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,000
So wait for another discussion now

1881
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Then maybe in a few years

1882
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
At least we all have these quizzes

1883
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Then there are laws

1884
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
So I guess if there's interest I guess it should

1885
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
at least become a scientist

1886
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
It is a very important report field

1887
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
I think this and the others are probably

1888
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
It's the newsroom of the guardian

1889
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Thank you, thank you Mayor for your wonderful speech

1890
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:56,000
My personal question is related to the previous question

1891
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Then the mayor mentioned in the report that

1892
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,800
This is the development of biotechnology

1893
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:08,800
One thing that needs to be considered is the impact on the ecology

1894
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,000
We know that in Europe and America

1895
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,200
It has a very important role in the development of biotechnology

1896
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:20,800
That is to say, to engage in the so-called Tianjian experiment

1897
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,800
Inmimental Release

1898
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:27,800
Because in this biomodified crop

1899
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,800
Before licensing

1900
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,800
So I don't know that in our country

1901
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,800
If you are engaged in the development of biotechnology

1902
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:40,800
Is it necessary to engage in the so-called big sky experiment?

1903
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,800
this is my problem thanks

1904
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,800
we have this rule

1905
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:49,800
Taiwan now has two

1906
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,800
Actually there are several stages

1907
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:55,800
One is your small field experiment

1908
01:33:55,800 --> 01:34:00,800
Now the South Center of Academia Sinica, Chung Hsing University

1909
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,440
There are also farms with this facility

1910
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:09,540
That means you can do small-scale facilities for genetically modified crops

1911
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:14,040
Then the large scale you mentioned is only owned by the Central University and the Farming Department.

1912
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:19,640
Now that's the papaya I was talking about

1913
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:23,540
Teacher Ye Xidong's papaya is already doing experiments at this stage

1914
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:30,820
Mr. Chen Nongwang's frog dishes are still being made on a small scale

1915
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:32,860
windy

1916
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:34,300
so yes we have

1917
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:40,780
It is only because the regulations for genetically modified crops to be marketed have really matured in the past two years

1918
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:44,780
Now it’s still called the Chief, and it’s still called the Draft in the Executive Yuan.

1919
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:47,180
but he already said

1920
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:51,700
Because you have farmers though the market for papaya is mainly in India

1921
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:54,900
India still has to see you in Taiwan before he accepts it

1922
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:57,020
So our Council of Agriculture has taken this into consideration

1923
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:59,060
So now there is a set here

1924
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:00,060
So that instruction you said

1925
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:10,000
This problem also exists for other machine modification linkages.

1926
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
there is a problem here

1927
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Now in the market I see

1928
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I see in the market later

1929
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
In short, it will become less and less

1930
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Just one of the models before

1931
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Modified machine

1932
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
So in terms of biodiversity

1933
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
from this icon

1934
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
The second question is that you need to say

1935
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Mention does not have to

1936
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
to be in the model

1937
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
They are all in the machine, mainly for themselves

1938
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
reduced one re-open

1939
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Then you mentioned that yes

1940
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
you mentioned again

1941
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,560
If it is said to be a successful usage in this press

1942
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:04,100
just use that

1943
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:07,680
Why can't we use our current adoption method

1944
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:08,700
exist

1945
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:12,040
super far one that is pressed

1946
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,820
say the method used

1947
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,620
Then use the method

1948
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:17,400
or a poker

1949
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:19,460
can be in that kind of

1950
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:20,740
at this

1951
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:22,520
in sweep usage

1952
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:25,340
Second, if we talk about those few things, what are they?

1953
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:28,160
OK that

1954
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:32,000
The first question is whether it will affect biodiversity

1955
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:32,760
because

1956
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:34,300
all

1957
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:38,900
Because of the GMOs you made

1958
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:40,200
probably have a market

1959
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:41,220
so you should be all

1960
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:42,760
so-called making

1961
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:45,560
In fact, the object itself is a

1962
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:46,840
one

1963
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:49,920
This is what you plant in a unit area

1964
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:53,760
So I don't think it should affect the so-called

1965
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:55,560
biodiversity

1966
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,340
Our diversity is actually

1967
01:36:57,340 --> 01:36:59,340
it's not us

1968
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,800
There's no variety, you're just one of those kinds

1969
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:06,880
So I guess it shouldn't be a big problem

1970
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,600
As for that

1971
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:12,480
I think it means why are you so watery?

1972
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:19,040
Just don't use water, why not use that cauliflower

1973
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,720
I think it's cost related

1974
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:23,920
It is how much labor you need to spend, how much you can plant

1975
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:27,520
Like the way of American Chinese artists

1976
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:30,240
He is completely mechanical, he is very dense

1977
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:32,160
So the species he encountered was

1978
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:36,240
That is, he can only go up, but not bend

1979
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,720
So what kind of disaster do you want?

1980
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:41,920
what kind do you want

1981
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:46,080
i want this

1982
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,320
What we call a crop, his competitive

1983
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,440
Actually not very big

1984
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:52,240
So when you get water, you use water to help him

1985
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,000
let him grow up well

1986
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,200
he's used to it

1987
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:59,600
That is to say, in fact, we humans have been planting water for almost 10,000 years.

1988
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,100
So I guess the ones that are more popular now

1989
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:06,240
Maybe I said it doesn't need water to live

1990
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:07,800
just say it can live

1991
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:10,100
But its competitiveness is not necessarily so strong

1992
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:12,740
So I guess there is still a need for a new flat tide

1993
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:18,640
As for the problems of miscellaneous tides

1994
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,940
I think this is roughly

1995
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:24,520
with the technical aspects of agriculture that we have now

1996
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:27,220
It should be possible to cultivate

1997
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:29,620
So I have a final

1998
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:32,020
We want to be equal to our new technology

1999
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:33,580
plus that cultivation

2000
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:38,620
Is it possible to have a set of platforms to do it?

2001
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:41,260
I don't know if this answers your question

2002
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:48,420
I want to ask the teacher

2003
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:52,200
It's about reproductive energy.

2004
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,000
Teacher, we just mentioned today

2005
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,300
It's because there seem to be many more

2006
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,040
Technology to break down living things to do

2007
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,040
What is the teacher

2008
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Do you think, for example, Higher Brand or MicroRG

2009
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Which one does the teacher think is more likely to be commercialized in the future?

2010
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Also, what research technologies must be done before commercialization

2011
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Then we can do business

2012
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I think the problem has two

2013
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
The first question he asked was to say

2014
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Because we have a team of researchers, including Wang Wuyuan

2015
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
We are doing reproductive agriculture in a pretty big team

2016
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
What we do in reproductive agriculture is the second generation

2017
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:40,000
That is, we don't use electrograin to ferment, but to make alcohol

2018
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
We use plant cell currency

2019
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:49,000
That is to say, some people say that plants can dance

2020
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,000
To make it cell money, cell money is mainly cellulose and pie cellulose

2021
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Convert it to brassan for your flower effect

2022
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,000
I think this technique should work

2023
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,400
The other is the source of cell coins

2024
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:16,000
If someone tells you that the agricultural association can let you use it as the main source of alcohol

2025
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,600
You tell him to do the math

2026
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:22,800
If you really want to use reproduction to make alcohol

2027
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,200
you must have reproductive crops

2028
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:27,400
talking crops

2029
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:30,400
You can't just rely on agriculture and corporate affairs

2030
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:32,800
if you really want to replace

2031
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:35,800
For example, 230% of Petronas

2032
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:38,400
You must be an eloquent crop

2033
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:43,400
You can't say that relying on agriculture will lead to business

2034
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:46,600
Then I also object to using Dao sense to make alcohol

2035
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:51,800
Because Taiwanese farmers have their own reasons for feeling burned.

2036
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:55,000
because he returns nutrients to the land

2037
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,600
He burned the second one

2038
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,200
In fact, it can be said that the soil inside

2039
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,160
Burnt from soft or something

2040
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,120
So although they are air pollution

2041
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:06,000
There is air pollution

2042
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,960
Then this is what you want to evaluate

2043
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:10,040
But if you really put all your sense of Tao

2044
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:11,760
take it all

2045
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:13,600
First, your cost is definitely not enough

2046
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:16,920
Because Taiwan is all small farmers

2047
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:17,880
so you take the sense

2048
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:21,600
To gather together to do even nine thousand

2049
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,160
You don't have enough money for the first one

2050
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,160
the second you will

2051
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:28,440
Your nutrients did not return to that land

2052
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:31,520
So your question I think is

2053
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,680
you must have energy crops

2054
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:34,160
Taiwan land in small

2055
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:35,720
Don't Make Your Own Energy Crops

2056
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:37,080
we develop technology

2057
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:39,120
After your technology matures,

2058
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:41,000
see if you can do that

2059
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,000
but i think you really want alternative energy

2060
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:47,880
Early class I want variety

2061
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,360
you can't just rely on

2062
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,520
For example, if you only rely on a certain energy crop

2063
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:54,080
Of course everyone is groping now

2064
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:57,040
The second generation of that even energy technology

2065
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:58,280
so if you want

2066
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:00,080
Taiwan will be like the people

2067
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,220
have enough scientific energy

2068
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:05,860
So we should develop more

2069
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:07,400
If you want to develop even without

2070
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:08,660
do a few first

2071
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:11,660
And take the road of technological development

2072
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:15,000
Then when the time comes, you actually have the key technology

2073
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,460
Research material is not

2074
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:18,920
That is, if other places can

2075
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:20,260
can want

2076
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:21,360
you have technology

2077
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,260
Your research is definitely a problem

2078
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:25,860
So I think what we want to develop in Taiwan is the middle section

2079
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:27,960
technology

2080
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:34,260
next our children

2081
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:35,260
What about everyone?

2082
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:56,200
Where

2083
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:59,300
our disorder

2084
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,720
Plant a tree in ten years and turn it into a tree in a year

2085
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:07,560
If you think this tree can grow and be used in one year

2086
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:13,280
Then I think the development of existing energy is a very breakthrough

2087
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:16,480
The second is that there was a newspaper report recently that

2088
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,440
Abroad is already researching something

2089
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:20,440
called artificial leaves

2090
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:23,280
It is said that only God can make leaves

2091
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,880
But now people can already make leaves

2092
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:27,200
Then this leaf is made

2093
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:28,920
It can accept light

2094
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:31,800
Then it can be generated

2095
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:36,680
even a mimic leaf

2096
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:40,040
When it passes through the American Department

2097
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:41,400
both sides of its leaves

2098
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:45,240
One side is to divide water into green and oxygen

2099
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:46,280
one side is green

2100
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:47,240
one side is oxygen

2101
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:49,720
In this way, the oxygen can be separated

2102
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:51,160
Then of course it can change

2103
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:53,600
So its ideal is to say

2104
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:57,120
Ordinary households can take advantage of this technology

2105
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:59,520
workers to their own power

2106
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
two topics

2107
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
One is a bit earlier

2108
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
time book report

2109
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
one is a newspaper report that came in

2110
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Then these two questions

2111
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
I don't know what's inside our courtyard

2112
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Have you thought about it in this direction?

2113
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Thanks

2114
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
I can answer the first question

2115
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
i think nature

2116
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
is there such a number

2117
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Number of developments

2118
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
He grows several meters a year

2119
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
so in

2120
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Northern Europe and Australia

2121
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
They've put the number in order

2122
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
then they

2123
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Also take this as an eloquent crop

2124
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
There are also word making materials

2125
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
so

2126
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
have we ever thought

2127
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
have

2128
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
But we don't think about counting

2129
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
we want basket flowers

2130
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Because the basket flowers from that

2131
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Get out of that organization

2132
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
I'm going to that seedling again

2133
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
almost two years

2134
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Then why does he grow so fast

2135
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
so slow

2136
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
then we use this

2137
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
basic science perspective

2138
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
come and see this

2139
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
but

2140
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Some blue parks in the south are interested in hearing us do this

2141
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,200
They said whether to cooperate with the industry association

2142
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:09,000
This is still far from cooperation

2143
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
All we have to ask is why butterfly blue

2144
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,800
the rate at which its cells divide

2145
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,300
That is to say it grows so slowly

2146
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:17,200
why two years

2147
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:21,500
Because some varieties of blue flowers do not need a year

2148
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:26,600
It can be from planting flower buds to fruiting

2149
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:28,100
so we are thinking

2150
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:31,800
but we are thinking

2151
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:34,400
In fact, if you say that you are not affected by the industry, you are lying.

2152
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,300
because we people ask us

2153
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:38,000
that is, can you do this

2154
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,200
so we start thinking

2155
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,700
so we're thinking

2156
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:43,800
This is actually a very difficult problem

2157
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:48,600
Because this question is for people who are doing plants

2158
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:50,000
This question is rarely asked

2159
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,100
That is to say, your cells divide in the plant body

2160
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:53,200
how to be controlled

2161
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:54,900
and the growth of its cells

2162
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:56,300
Cell Size Control

2163
01:45:56,300 --> 01:45:57,800
this is rarely done

2164
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:59,500
so we are thinking

2165
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:00,100
naturally

2166
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,480
And there is this diversity

2167
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:04,760
So this is an interesting success problem

2168
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:06,760
this i think will do

2169
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:08,760
it is possible and someone is thinking

2170
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:10,760
The second question is to compare

2171
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:14,760
Also a bit out of my field

2172
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:16,760
because i know someone who was

2173
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:19,760
Because of this light ear effect

2174
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:23,760
You said that this leaf should have oxygen and water

2175
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,760
that actually

2176
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,760
The process itself is not so simple

2177
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:30,960
there is that

2178
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,960
have nobel prize winners

2179
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:34,960
just do that

2180
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,960
The electronic group component of the karmic body

2181
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:38,960
that it is predicted

2182
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,960
That is to say, it is possible to do this

2183
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:44,960
But I haven't at least in science

2184
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:46,960
That is to say, I don't know which newspaper to read.

2185
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,960
at least in this

2186
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,960
I don't know if the internet has seen it

2187
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:52,960
That is to say, this aspect of the article

2188
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:54,960
then we can go back

2189
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:56,960
look at this aspect

2190
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:58,960
I can only tell you today that I don't know

2191
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
probably still some distance

2192
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
still some distance

2193
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,000
are there any other questions

2194
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:10,000
there is one over there

2195
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Hello, teacher. I am the student of this year's position.

2196
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
then i want to ask

2197
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Is that I'm subservient to the front until now down

2198
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Actually I have been having a problem

2199
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
That is to say, when we are doing genetic modification

2200
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
That's when we were doing Trims Form

2201
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
why can't we say

2202
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,000
It's the one that let the farmer plant it

2203
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
genetically modified plants

2204
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
the first offspring

2205
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,000
There is no way to continue to produce a second offspring

2206
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Is there any other issue involved?

2207
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
because i knew it was

2208
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,000
We have this technology in

2209
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,000
But it seems there is no way to do it

2210
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:53,000
You say you want them to have only the first offspring

2211
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,000
But I can't go down and plant myself

2212
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Yes because it is to avoid

2213
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,460
because when we choose

2214
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:02,500
we are usually in

2215
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:07,200
and some other antibiotic genes

2216
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:10,840
If we want to avoid the spread of its genes

2217
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:14,160
Does that mean that it cannot produce a second generation?

2218
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:16,160
This approach should be better

2219
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:22,560
I think it should be theoretically possible to do so

2220
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:25,760
But that means you can put

2221
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:29,600
You can have this mechanism of marriage paper

2222
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:32,360
you can even put

2223
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:33,360
I think in theory you could

2224
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:35,360
That is to say, the gene jumped out in the second generation

2225
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:36,360
should be no problem

2226
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,060
should theoretically be able to do

2227
01:48:38,060 --> 01:48:46,060
It's just that I think most of it, at least I think it means

2228
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:48,800
The way I tell you is

2229
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,600
That Meng Shantou they are controlling

2230
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:53,560
because they sold that seed

2231
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:56,060
They don't want the farmers to harvest the seeds themselves and plant them again

2232
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:57,600
Don't buy seeds from him

2233
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:59,600
So they're a farmer with you

2234
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,560
How many seeds do you plant a year and he takes pictures of you

2235
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:05,880
If you didn’t buy many seeds from him in the second year, he will sue you

2236
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:08,440
if you plant it

2237
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:12,040
You planted more seeds than you bought from him

2238
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:13,060
he will sue you

2239
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:15,620
How many other farmers have been paid millions of dollars

2240
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:17,660
I just turned him upside down

2241
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:19,200
i think you planted

2242
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:21,240
If you want to give to the peasants, you should give to the peasants

2243
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:24,840
As long as it is your own designed savings

2244
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:27,140
Without the possibility of environmental pollution

2245
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:28,160
because your first generation

2246
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:29,700
if you are afraid

2247
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:32,040
I am afraid that the second generation and the first generation should not go out.

2248
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:37,420
I think the businessman gave us three heads, of course he would like to have this

2249
01:49:39,220 --> 01:49:40,240
put me right upside down

2250
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,840
This second generation like the recent

2251
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:47,400
glowfish they quadruple him

2252
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:49,720
he won't pass it down

2253
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:52,520
Otherwise, if your fish is sold, they will keep raising it

2254
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,840
don't do your business

2255
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:56,880
Yes, different considerations

2256
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:59,440
But farmers are stronger, so it should be

2257
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
ok so last two questions

2258
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Excuse me, sir, I have a very simple question for you

2259
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
That's our one, we're only talking about rice now

2260
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Is there a way to turn vegetables from aerobic respiration

2261
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Switch to anaerobic respiration, so you won't be afraid of typhoons

2262
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
it's all rotten thanks

2263
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:32,000
I mean, switch to aerobic, switch to anaerobic

2264
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
All plants will have proof for you

2265
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
So it should be some other mechanism

2266
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
It can't be filled for a long time

2267
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
the vegetables our next step is

2268
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
we make rice from that

2269
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
And do the so-called Arab world, learned

2270
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,000
we are going to start now

2271
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
talks about cutting plants

2272
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
We Taiwanese farmers are actually very smart

2273
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,000
we haven't invented yet

2274
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
They have come up with some solutions

2275
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
they put that

2276
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,960
It's just that it's not easy to change money.

2277
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:06,460
Some are actually very antigenic

2278
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:07,820
They use cheap

2279
01:51:07,820 --> 01:51:09,840
so you don't have to do anything

2280
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:11,840
It's good to change chicken to beans

2281
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,040
And our farmers in Taiwan are very powerful

2282
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:16,720
They can even mechanize the price street

2283
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:20,080
So how many hundreds of dollars do you want to buy from him?

2284
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:22,080
I'll give it to you in a week

2285
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:23,760
So I buy from them for experiments

2286
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:24,660
I don't have to go by myself

2287
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:27,040
So some farmers are better than me

2288
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:28,680
so vegetables are

2289
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:29,760
vegetables are better

2290
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:32,260
Because vegetables usually if they are leafy vegetables

2291
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:34,560
you want leaves

2292
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:35,840
So use the price street method

2293
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:37,880
Our Taiwanese bitter gourd and loofah

2294
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:39,440
This is all solved by this

2295
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:43,640
But when the typhoon came, the leafy vegetables were all destroyed.

2296
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:44,800
right so

2297
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:46,600
The problem is that in fact

2298
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,280
If you let it become antigenic water

2299
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:49,920
probably means

2300
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:52,240
often some are

2301
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:54,540
make it look bad

2302
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:57,080
That is to say, what you gain is what you lose

2303
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:59,200
import a feature

2304
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:00,000
it tends to

2305
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
But what we're thinking now is that this mechanism is

2306
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
It only activates when you're flooded

2307
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
It's not like water until those mechanisms are always there

2308
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
so we are thinking

2309
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Vegetables may be simpler than water

2310
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Because usually we resolve by saying

2311
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
You change to anaerobic and non-inhalation method

2312
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
A gene is expressed more

2313
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,000
it's more stuck

2314
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
so this is ok

2315
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
so only when i come back

2316
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
never thought of doing this

2317
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Running every time a typhoon comes

2318
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I'm thinking about it now

2319
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
So we'll start doing that

2320
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Thanks

2321
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,000
and the last one

2322
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Supost let me ask a question

2323
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Questions that might stray from your topic today

2324
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:57,000
It is about the market supply and demand of food

2325
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
I am a Meng Yichang

2326
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,680
Now seven or eight years ago in Taiwan we had that except bemi

2327
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:07,400
That surplus of old rice is almost going to the shop

2328
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:11,400
Encourage soldiers and college students to eat more rice

2329
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:13,940
at that time

2330
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:19,480
The welfare soldiers are short of about 2.8 million tons of 10 meters

2331
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:24,380
It was time for the overworked President of Asda

2332
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:26,580
I used to do business at that time

2333
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:31,180
At that time, I loved Taiwan and wanted to sell this rice there.

2334
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:33,180
Turns out Taiwan is very bureaucratic

2335
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:36,180
All of a sudden, the Central Trust Bureau by bidding

2336
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:38,180
It's only 10,000 to 20,000 tons at a time

2337
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:41,180
And I have to Zengxun, pack and transport

2338
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:44,680
wow that's tiring so i'm from vietnam

2339
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:49,680
They're all packed and shipped to the next one for sale there.

2340
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:52,680
So just now you mentioned again

2341
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:55,180
Welfare soldiers can do three goods in a row, right?

2342
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:56,780
There should be no shortage of rice

2343
01:53:56,780 --> 01:53:59,580
Why is he still missing more than two million tons in a row?

2344
01:53:59,580 --> 01:54:00,080
that currently

2345
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,400
I don't know if there is any improvement, I don't know

2346
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:03,440
These people, my master, can come to ask you for advice

2347
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:04,280
Why

2348
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:10,280
Let's just say go to the International Waterways Center every year

2349
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:14,600
At dusk, the International Waterway Center is at Huilibin

2350
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:16,160
so they feel ashamed

2351
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:18,200
The world's best waterway research center

2352
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:20,360
Every year in Huilibin

2353
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:26,080
In fact, when it is politically stable

2354
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:27,000
not like this

2355
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,320
Huilibin is actually very rich in nature.

2356
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:33,520
He has no reason not to be autonomous

2357
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:35,360
so it's a matter of politics

2358
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:40,080
rather than an economic or agricultural issue

2359
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:41,880
because of their social policy

2360
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:44,600
Nearby their rich and poor

2361
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:45,920
right

2362
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:48,280
If you want the government to have a heart

2363
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:51,320
Like Vietnam becoming the second largest in the world within a few years

2364
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:53,760
the rice exporting country

2365
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:55,360
You can see they use

2366
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:58,320
the technology they use

2367
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,080
I'm with that silent teacher

2368
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,800
COA wants us to evaluate them

2369
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:04,100
because of them

2370
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:05,900
because

2371
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:09,720
WTO relationship we have to import 6% of rice every year

2372
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:10,760
so we buy it ourselves

2373
01:55:11,260 --> 01:55:13,060
Taiwan has always sold in the United States

2374
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:14,840
Recently, Vietnam has been selling

2375
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:16,380
then we are

2376
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:18,680
The rice imported from the United States we are

2377
01:55:18,940 --> 01:55:19,460
Sampling

2378
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:21,500
Vietnamese rice we are

2379
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:23,300
Check each batch

2380
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:25,860
The Council of Agriculture wants us to go

2381
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:26,880
look at him

2382
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:28,420
the one you produced

2383
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:32,260
When we came back from that process, we suggested to him that we should come back.

2384
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:33,540
Continue to check without package

2385
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:34,820
That

2386
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:39,680
So but as long as the country has that, they are very labor-intensive

2387
01:55:41,220 --> 01:55:42,240
So their current rice

2388
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:43,780
Even though the quality is not good

2389
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:44,800
but they have enough

2390
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:47,620
There's no reason not to do well

2391
01:55:48,380 --> 01:55:50,680
That's his social structure and his political problems

2392
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:51,700
this

2393
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:53,500
no one can help

2394
01:55:54,020 --> 01:55:54,780
only themselves

2395
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:56,320
they have the best

2396
01:55:57,080 --> 01:55:57,600
world

2397
01:55:58,360 --> 01:55:59,400
best waterway

2398
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:06,140
The research center is just at Rose Beach, just at the establishment of diplomatic relations in Marilla, he has no reason to do it

2399
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:11,780
Moreover, there are thousands of islands, and the lack of thousands of islands is really

2400
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:13,560
More than two million tons a year

2401
01:56:13,820 --> 01:56:19,200
Every time you go to our Guojin rice center, you are really bad

2402
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:21,500
no split price

2403
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:26,620
Well, thanks, we actually I have two observations that I have today

2404
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:29,440
see so many people come to listen

2405
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,040
It can be seen that everyone is interested in these agricultural

2406
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:35,380
The topic is also very concerned, I think it's pretty good

2407
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:39,480
Without agriculture, we would have no food, this is very serious

2408
01:56:39,980 --> 01:56:42,540
So this another

2409
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:46,120
What the mayor didn't talk about, what he just said

2410
01:56:46,380 --> 01:56:48,440
farmers these our technology is very good and so on

2411
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:49,720
but

2412
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:51,240
how do we do this

2413
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:53,040
Actually just with this

2414
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:58,920
The fact that the second generation is not long has a little bit to do with how we protect our own sanctions

2415
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
It's a good thing developed.

2416
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Unfortunately, many kinds of sneaks are now

2417
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,000
then run across from us

2418
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Then grow something and sell it to us

2419
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
this is also a problem

2420
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,000
So in this new species you make

2421
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
or these things

2422
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
how do we protect ourselves

2423
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
If you can have this idea

2424
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Then he will use this thing

2425
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
we can take his money

2426
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
so we can make more money to

2427
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Otherwise, Taiwan will have problems in the future

2428
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
we are so small

2429
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
no way to compete

2430
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
well, thank you very much for coming

2431
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
thank you
