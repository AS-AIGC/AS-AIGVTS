00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
music

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
music

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000

00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:00,000

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
music

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
are still here listening to this speech

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It takes a lot of enthusiasm

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
so first of all congratulations

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Our lecture today is sponsored by the Institute of Culture and Philosophy, Academia Sinica

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Director Hu Xiaozhen

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
to give a lecture

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Director Hu is one of the youngest directors of Academia Sinica

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It should be the youngest

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But I don't know that the director of the chemistry department may be younger than you

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Then the famous rich woman

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Rich women are also one of the subjects of his research

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Director Hu is a graduate of National Taiwan University

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Then go to the UCC Provincial Union to study for a master's degree

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Then went to Harvard University to get a Ph.D.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This is what a rich woman should have.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Then his research direction

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
related to women

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
his three directions

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The first is young women's literature

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I think you have many

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
may have noted his famous book in this regard

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It is inevitable for a rich woman to test her career

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The Scheming of Modern Chinese Women's Narrative Literature

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,540
It was in early 2003

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,840
His second principle is

35
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,200
Re-exploring the conflict and fusion between Ming and Qing literature and modern literature

36
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,820
Under this topic, he wrote a book "Society where mental ideals and physical strength cannot be amnesiac".

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,160
This book was published in 2011

38
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,460
get 2012 soon

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,780
Academia Sinica's first Humanities and Social Sciences Special Book Award

40
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,380
The third direction of research is his recent research

41
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,940
I haven't seen any literature on this

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,240
But maybe already, I don't know

43
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,820
It is to study the presentation of Southwest China by young literati

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,380
Well, there are very few researchers on this topic

45
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,920
must be interesting

46
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,300
Chief Hu has received many honors including this

47
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,380
Youth of Academia Sinica in 1999

48
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,160
Scholar Research Work Award

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,980
2003 Wu Daer Award of the National Science Council

50
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,060
And the 2012 I just reported to you

51
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,320
The First Humanities and Social Sciences Special Book Award

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,160
He also invited the International Conference of Japanese Orientalists in Japan

53
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,000
The keynote speech

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is also an honor that is not easy to get.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,500
The topic of Mr. Hu's speech today is Chinese women's travel experience

56
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,000
From Ming and Qing Dynasties to Early Ming Dynasty

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,500
I think this topic is quite interesting

58
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,000
Because ancient women seem to travel less

59
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
so this is a

60
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,500
Research in this area is not easy

61
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,500
The second trip is a very attractive thing for many people

62
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,500
I am a colleague of the History Institute of China-Ireland Studies

63
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,500
We used to have an old director

64
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
He is now in his 80s

65
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
I asked him why did you devote yourself to history?

66
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,500
He said that when he was studying in Yizu School in Nanjing

67
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,500
My favorite is to go to a small hotel at the front to see the registration department of the hotel

68
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Registry Department

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
from where to where to go

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
its history is not

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let's learn where we come from and where we go

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So it has since decided to study history

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
so this story i keep telling

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In the future, when I write an article, I should start with this

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
so travel

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
travel hotels etc. are very

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
big has a lot of imagination

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
very interesting topic

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
so i think many people come today

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's all because he was deeply attracted by Chief Hu's personal dismissal

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and the attraction of this topic

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I won't say much now

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We now welcome Chief Hu with applause

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
ask yuma

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Just now Dean Wang Fei mentioned

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Today is such a wet and cold winter day

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and still this

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's Friday night, the eve of the holiday.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well in fact I just got

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This task in the courtyard

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't know the seriousness of this matter

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I just know it's the end of December

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I found out later that it was December 24th

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I thought to myself that this task is too difficult.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So how can we have a topic that can attract everyone?

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
How about coming to Academia Sinica on such a day?

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So the vice president just mentioned

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Chinese women in our impression

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Isn't it very fulfilling?

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
so let's talk

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Chinese Women's Fulfillment Experience

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Surely this deceitful subject

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You can fool everyone

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So obviously it seems to have had some success

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Although my topic is customized

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Chinese Women's Fulfillment Experience

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But I really have to start by saying

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
There's absolutely no way this speech can be put together for you.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Or crawling books or talking about

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This millennium or this hundreds of years

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
of Chinese women's experience with this fulfillment

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
no way to do a full description

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Of course, a big reason for this is that

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
i'm not a historian at all

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm actually noticing

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
this historian is doing

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,500
makes me feel very nervous

119
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,300
i am not a historian

120
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,700
There is no way to do this description historically

121
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,300
So what should I say I really want to talk about?

122
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,700
Is it a woman who travels

123
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,100
how to travel

124
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,400
What means of transportation did you use to travel?

125
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,700
where did you travel

126
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,500
Or must have seen something, etc. These questions

127
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,600
because I study literature

128
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,400
what i want to talk about

129
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,800
It should be said that it is a literary work, how to write it

130
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,400
this woman's journey

131
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,700
And when the woman's trip actually happened

132
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,200
What about this trip and his writing

133
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,800
What effect will it have?

134
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,100
This is the question I want to know

135
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,800
So today I will talk about a special woman

136
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,500
from her life

137
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,800
From her travel experience

138
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,000
And her writing in the mail?

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,400
start as core

140
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,900
then spread out

141
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,300
Trying to describe my travels with Chinese women

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,560
An Observation on the Problem of Travel

143
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,160
well then

144
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,660
sorry

145
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,260
Okay, so let's start with this twentieth-century

146
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,820
once very very famous one

147
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,860
Women's Tour Begins

148
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,440
so who is this woman

149
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,740
Her name is Lu Bicheng

150
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,100
Lu Bicheng was born in 1883

151
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,620
Then the one who died in 1943

152
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,460
So it's basically this pro-Wo Mingchu period guy

153
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,520
Then she was really famous at the time

154
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,560
a rich woman writer

155
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,580
also an educator

156
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,880
also a tourist

157
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,440
Then her life is very, very wonderful

158
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,000
We can almost say there's something about her

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,560
It's just that nothing is ordinary

160
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,380
Her life is spent with extraordinary

161
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,920
to define

162
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,740
Then she was born in Anhui

163
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,020
This is still my same

164
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,040
Datong Township

165
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,320
A late man in Anhui, one key family

166
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,120
So we can say that her early life

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
is a standard Guixiu

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,400
Like those mentioned in my previous research

169
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,600
The Guixiu rich girl in the Ming and Qing Dynasties is the same

170
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,500
she was born in a good family

171
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,800
Father is an official, mother knows how to take care of books and is literate

172
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,000
teach her to read and write

173
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,200
There is a very good private library in the house

174
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,400
She can study golden shit by herself since she was a child

175
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,200
Probably such a background

176
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
But what?

177
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,400
Lu Licheng, she is more unfortunate

178
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Her father died when she was very young

179
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,200
Then there were some disputes in her family.

180
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,200
So they can no longer gain a foothold in their hometown

181
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,800
then her mother wants

182
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Lu Licheng can live and work in peace

183
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,500
further education is available

184
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,100
sent Lu Licheng to her uncle's house

185
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,400
Where is this uncle's house?

186
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,300
In a place called Tanggu

187
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,400
Of course this is not far from Tianjin

188
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
So obviously Lu Licheng is there

189
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,800
She continues to grow her this

190
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,800
this classical aspect of this

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,420
Ability to read and write

192
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,140
But when he was about 20 years old

193
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,780
He has a renewed desire

194
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,940
what is this wish

195
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,300
It is that he hopes to go to a bigger place

196
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,340
go and see

197
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,020
what happened in the new place

198
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,700
Especially new women's schools

199
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,300
Appeared in China at this time

200
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,860
What do women's schools teach?

201
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,140
Lu Bicheng has a new wish in her heart

202
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,420
so he decided

203
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,820
to the nearest big city

204
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,420
That is Tianjin to see

205
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,020
What is the so-called new style of women's school?

206
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,980
Then at this time he received

207
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,740
resistance of very very large families

208
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,860
that is his uncle

209
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,980
with a more traditional way of thinking

210
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,620
of course stop him

211
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,580
Then this Lu Bicheng

212
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,620
seems for the record

213
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,420
He's been a boy since he was little

214
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,420
a girl

215
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,820
It is more dispatchable

216
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,220
So he was so angry

217
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,620
just ran away from home

218
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,020
What's even more frightening?

219
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,220
when he ran away from home

220
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,020
bring nothing

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
according to his own statement

222
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
he confiscated the luggage

223
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
no money

224
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
I got on the train alone

225
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,800
going to tianjin

226
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,600
Then this may well be the beginning of a tragedy

227
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,000
right

228
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,800
But Lu Bicheng is still very lucky

229
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,400
he is on this train

230
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,000
met a

231
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,800
A nobleman who helped him a lot

232
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,200
who is this person

233
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,600
Let's see Lu Bicheng's life

234
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
from this time on

235
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,400
Just have an indissoluble bond with Lu Xingjie

236
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Who is this noble man he knows?

237
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,600
It is a famous hotel in Tianjin

238
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Mistress of Fozhaolou

239
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
So

240
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,000
And we also found that Lu Bicheng

241
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,600
He obviously has an innate ability

242
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,200
He can explain different people on the journey

243
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,000
if i guess if i were on the train

244
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I might just go all the way to the empty city

245
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,200
just no one cares about me

246
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,400
But Lu Bicheng is on the train

247
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
be able to explain to a stranger

248
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,200
and help him

249
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,800
so what

250
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,400
This Lu Bi achievement follows this

251
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Fozhaolou Hotel

252
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,800
The proprietress has arrived in Tianjin

253
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,600
And what?

254
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,200
The hostess also introduced him

255
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,800
a more important person

256
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
It's Lu Bicheng

257
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,160
Who was it? That was from the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao at that time.

258
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,840
This is like saying boss

259
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,000
Eagle chain weaving

260
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,040
So what about this eagle chain weaving?

261
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,720
After reading this letter that Lu Bicheng offered to him,

262
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,920
What about after the poem?

263
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,400
He said such a young girl

264
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,840
able to write such a good article

265
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,600
very very touched

266
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,320
So what about this eagle chain weaving?

267
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Just ran to this Fozhao Tower to find Lu Bicheng

268
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,920
And what about inviting him to write for this Ta Kung Pao

269
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
writing

270
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
So from now on, what about Lu Bicheng?

271
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,080
It's like starting to explore the world in Tianjin

272
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,480
So he started writing for this paper?

273
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,760
be an editor, wait

274
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,840
so because of

275
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,040
He is so rich

276
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,040
What I wrote made a lot of this

277
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,720
this text

278
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,240
This is it

279
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,760
celebrity

280
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,200
This man of letters

281
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
are very very shocked

282
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,760
So he quickly

283
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,080
In the area of ​​Beijing and Tianjin

284
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,400
want to be very famous

285
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,840
He also had contacts with many famous literati

286
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,680
Everyone sees this time

287
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,280
When I first arrived in Tianjin and entered Ta Kung Pao

288
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,440
On the left is Lu Bicheng

289
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,240
The one on the right is the lady of the theater

290
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,360
I'm sorry, is there a problem?

291
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,160
OK good

292
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,440
Lu Bicheng had some other experiences after this

293
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,640
He once entered Yuan Shikai's government

294
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,200
served as Yuan Shikai's secretary

295
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,760
And a more special experience is

296
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,280
in 1906

297
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,240
In fact, he was in his early 20s at this time.

298
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,040
only 23 years old

299
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,040
In our case, a college graduate

300
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,920
but he has accepted

301
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,120
It is equivalent to accepting Yuan Shikai's commission

302
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,640
went to do one

303
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,040
It is considered a very early high school in the north

304
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,120
beiyang woman

305
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,260
It is a model school

306
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:01,960
And what?

307
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,480
He soon became the school's

308
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,480
called supervision

309
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,480
That's what we mean today

310
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,980
It's the principal

311
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,680
so what

312
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,520
What about Lu Bicheng in the 1910s

313
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,080
He is actually a

314
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,280
Educator Identity for Girls' Education

315
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
such an image appears

316
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,980
good

317
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,480
then but

318
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,800
During this time he wrote a lot

319
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,120
sing girl

320
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,960
What is this song about saving the country and the people?

321
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,240
what kind of articles

322
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,740
But what?

323
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,920
He didn't actually play such a role.

324
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,200
too long

325
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,480
after a few years

326
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,720
He left the circle

327
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,280
then start

328
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,640
Another image appeared

329
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,960
he arrived in shanghai

330
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,080
Become a foreign businessman like this

331
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,560
what a person doing business

332
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,240
And what?

333
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,640
lady is very smart

334
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,480
he is fast

335
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,240
really made money

336
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,720
living a very luxurious life

337
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,400
And what?

338
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,280
after this

339
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,720
He started to have some travel experience

340
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,560
then compare

341
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,240
we may be able to say unbelief

342
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,840
After this Lu Bicheng can even say

343
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,520
She's been homeless all her life.

344
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,280
She keeps wandering in different places

345
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,960
because of some other special factors

346
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,680
We don't have time here so I won't mention it

347
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,360
In fact, Lu Bicheng has never been married in his life.

348
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,320
So I guess it doesn't have to be in the same place as her

349
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,200
Then walking around still has a certain relationship

350
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,800
Then from 1918 to 1922

351
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,760
Of course, everyone think about this time

352
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,600
The May Fourth Movement was in 1919

353
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,120
Then when she was from 1918 to 1922

354
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,240
That is, before and after the May 4th News Movement

355
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,760
Lu Bicheng went to Columbia University in New York to audit and study

356
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,640
Let's take a look, this is Lu Bicheng from the Columbia period

357
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,880
Can you imagine this is an international student?

358
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,740
So where does this claim come from?

359
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,900
In fact after his death

360
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:14,400
There are records left by some religious friends who have been with him

361
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,800
So it is said that after Lu Bicheng arrived in New York?

362
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,400
where does he live he doesn't live in a school dormitory

363
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,500
He might not even have a formal semester

364
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,500
He lives in a big hotel in a big hotel in New York

365
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,700
And it is said that this Lu Bicheng's room where he lived

366
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,900
Incredibly big

367
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:38,000
The rent in this hotel is the most expensive in the whole hotel

368
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,500
What if the average Westerner lives in such a place?

369
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,900
Only stay for about a week at most

370
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,200
maybe there's no money left

371
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,300
But where did Lu Bicheng live at that time?

372
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,700
But you can live here for six months

373
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,300
And what about the lady-in-waiting of New York City at the time?

374
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,100
Everyone heard his name

375
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,600
Come to him again and hope to be friends with him

376
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,800
And whenever there is a banquet

377
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,200
What's the classic? Wait.

378
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,200
It's an honor to ask him to participate.

379
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,400
Then Li Yucheng responded to everyone's warm hospitality

380
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,600
So he keeps making beautiful new clothes

381
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,200
Maybe it's like the JC you see now

382
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,600
He makes all kinds of beautiful clothes

383
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,200
So if he goes to several parties a day

384
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,600
he keeps changing clothes

385
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,200
Just like a bride coming out of a room

386
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,000
Every banquet needs to change into different clothes

387
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And according to the record, his clothes are bright and colorful

388
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,800
Everyone who saw him thought he was a celestial being

389
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Appearing like a fairy

390
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,000
such a person

391
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,200
We probably don't imagine being an international student

392
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,800
because in our today's terminology

393
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,000
We will say this is called public grievance

394
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,400
This is called social grievance

395
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,000
So

396
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,800
So what about his Kobe image?

397
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
I think it's a social

398
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,560
Including Celebrities Home Talented Women Writers

399
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,800
such an image

400
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,480
We also think he looks like a phobia

401
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,320
he's been like this all his life

402
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,960
On the one hand, he pays great attention to his own image.

403
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,600
like self-pity

404
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,800
but on the other hand

405
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,840
We know his life is after the middle eye

406
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,680
In fact, it is a Buddhist

407
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,840
So he's on the one hand like a fear sparrow

408
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,400
admiring your own eyebrows

409
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,480
In this respect, I am persistent in cultivating Buddhism.

410
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,440
To Hongfa

411
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,920
To promote the protection of animals

412
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,600
no killing etc.

413
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,480
figure of a giantess

414
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,680
Such a seemingly contradictory

415
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,040
contradictory

416
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,000
two self-identities

417
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,200
in his life

418
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,240
from the beginning to the end

419
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,240
all the same

420
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,440
Of course, Yu Sheng at this time

421
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,000
This luxury, this luxurious image

422
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,240
In fact, it was with him at the time

423
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,080
Europe and the United States

424
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,840
The environment has something to do with it

425
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,840
we'll talk about that later

426
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,840
Then, after Lu Mishen graduated from Columbia University,

427
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,540
back to china

428
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,760
Or is it presumably living a life of social prestige?

429
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,460
But since 1926

430
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,360
He also started to go to Europe and America alone

431
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,320
live a long and vigorous life

432
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,400
Finally he went around and chose

433
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,000
Live among the deep light and water colors of this Switzerland

434
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,200
Then he did not return to China until 1933

435
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,360
Then I lived in Beijing

436
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,200
But soon because of this

437
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,160
The outbreak of the war against Japan

438
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,560
In order to avoid this action by the Japanese Tsinghua University

439
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,720
He went abroad again

440
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,640
Then I went through the wandering years again

441
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,160
So in the end he is in the state affairs of Hong Kong

442
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,560
Then let's say that the Republic of China starred in this

443
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,200
famous most famous traveler

444
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
What about civil travel?

445
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,000
refers to this

446
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,080
Lu Bicheng's work from 1926 to 1933

447
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,680
The experience of this trip to Europe and America

448
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,280
So why is this tour famous?

449
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,360
It wasn't that he was the only woman who went abroad

450
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,560
It's because Lu Bicheng himself is famous

451
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,600
right

452
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,720
Well, it's not because no one really went abroad at that time.

453
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,680
but because he himself went abroad while

454
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,120
He first announced in the newspaper that I was going abroad

455
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,080
And I'm going to be writing a post for dear readers

456
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,520
So this is almost like a self-promotional move.

457
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,480
He started traveling with himself

458
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,920
In places like Suncheon Times in Beijing and Danyue Magazine in Shanghai

459
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,280
start serializing his post

460
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,640
so in this way

461
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,480
The fame of this wit

462
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,480
And he was such a rare woman at the time

463
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,880
alone

464
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,500
Not with family, not with personal friends, etc.

465
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,380
Travel alone in Europe and America

466
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,100
And it's a long-term self-help

467
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,980
such a legendary

468
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,560
plus his own fortune

469
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,900
His writing is so talented

470
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,940
plus newspapers and magazines

471
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,060
flattery about the thing

472
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,840
Synergy of various factors

473
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,240
This makes Lu Bicheng's travel notes in Europe and America

474
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,000
already popular at the time

475
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,520
It is said that readers have strange expectations

476
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,480
I can see his travelogue

477
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,120
Not only increased the number of his travel notes published

478
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,080
Sales of these newspapers and magazines

479
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:44,280
It even seems to have caused a lot of piracy

480
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,720
just steal his work

481
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,680
He obviously didn't submit to this publication

482
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,280
This publication put his work on it

483
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,520
Then said he voted

484
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,160
or even worse

485
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,280
just to steal his work

486
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,960
Plus a lot of my own material

487
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,060
then say this

488
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's Lu Bicheng's

489
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
or

490
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,200
It's obviously Lu Bicheng's name changed

491
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,700
this was written by someone else

492
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,200
various behaviors

493
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,300
So what about Lu Bicheng?

494
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,400
has been very harshly criticized

495
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,800
This is now this China this

496
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,600
What about the behavior of the newspaper and magazine industry?

497
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,900
It's even scarier than this bandit

498
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,800
What about Lu Bicheng's mail?

499
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,000
This is his Lu post from 1926 to 1933

500
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,500
But what?

501
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,400
time this mailing was written

502
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,000
time of recording

503
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,600
Around 1926 to 1930

504
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,500
then what

505
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,900
pamphlet

506
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,900
this is us today

507
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,600
This difficult postage route to Europe and America that will be discussed later

508
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,500
Then he has another name?

509
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,300
Red Snow Dollar

510
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,800
so sorry

511
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,900
Of course, what about the name in front of it?

512
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,200
It's more realistic

513
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,700
Because he just went to Europe and the United States to separate

514
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,500
What about the name Hongxue Yingyuan in the back?

515
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,300
It is entrusted to this Lu Bicheng

516
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,900
some feelings of my own life

517
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,000
Then Lu Bicheng he from

518
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Started writing in 1926

519
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,760
And publish Europe and America roaming record

520
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,760
what is the type of his writing

521
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
or classical Chinese

522
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,260
He still writes in classical Chinese

523
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,260
In fact, Lu Bicheng

524
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,760
He never gave up classical Chinese

525
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,760
in the form of classical poetry

526
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,460
Then we know that he is a very important poetess in modern times

527
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,960
Some people say that he is three hundred years old

528
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
The most important and last female poetess

529
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,960
But this is already in 1926

530
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,960
30 years

531
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,960
We all know what kind of times this is

532
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,960
This is already the era of vernacular people learning, right?

533
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Didn’t the May Fourth News Movement happen in 1919?

534
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,960
Didn't the vernacular movement start a long time ago?

535
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,960
May Fourth novel that shouted not as early as 1923

536
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
already published?

537
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,960
Peng Hong was published in 1926

538
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
And two years later, in 1928,

539
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Hu Shi's vernacular

540
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,760
The first volume of literary history is about to appear

541
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,200
so it's a vernacular

542
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,840
an era of rising

543
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,000
but

544
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,920
Lu Bicheng seems to be completely ignoring the trend of this era

545
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,720
He still insists on writing in classical Chinese

546
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,800
He still has to write poems in the old style

547
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,880
old style words

548
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,040
And what?

549
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,080
in his text

550
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,160
It's still such an allusion

551
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,840
I like beautifully crafted words

552
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,040
Then we can't help but ask

553
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,480
why one so

554
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,720
seems to be very progressive

555
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,840
very independent

556
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,040
will be bold

557
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,920
A person who went to Europe and America to roam for a long time by himself

558
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,240
advanced women

559
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,840
Then his literary creation

560
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,400
or at least in his stylistic choices

561
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,680
why would he

562
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,080
seems so conservative

563
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,200
so old fashioned

564
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,680
reluctance to accept new possibilities

565
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,600
new trend

566
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,720
new things

567
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,480
Is there any contradiction in this?

568
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
If

569
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,800
We feel that experiments in literary creation

570
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,700
itself seems to be a kind of exodus

571
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,060
a kind of travel

572
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,060
an expedition

573
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,200
a try

574
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,600
a faraway word

575
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,060
then on behavior

576
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,860
Willing to boldly go to Europe and America

577
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,400
Lu Bicheng

578
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,660
Why in the creation of his text

579
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,860
He never tried to go out and see

580
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,960
That's what I'm curious about too.

581
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,360
what about us for now

582
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,700
Put this Lu Bi city aside

583
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,360
Leaving the 1920s for a while

584
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,760
Then I want to share with you for a while

585
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,360
Let's go back to the women of the Ming and Qing Dynasties

586
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,400
Of course for us women today

587
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,500
Travel is a long way

588
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,960
a long history

589
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,360
in my friends

590
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,660
will go on a self-guided trip

591
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,060
Of course I haven't done statistics.

592
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,860
But I don't think it's good for women

593
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,560
more than men

594
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,400
But we often seem to feel

595
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,360
travel alone

596
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,920
This is a constitutional fight woman

597
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,540
have the right

598
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,520
Because we always hear that women used to stay out of the house

599
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,400
Not bad for two

600
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,060
but actually

601
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,920
Even if we go back to the Ming and Qing Dynasties

602
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,400
There are still many benefits

603
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,320
There are still cases where women go out

604
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,740
For example a female she can follow her father

605
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:23,800
The husband or even the son has gone to be an official somewhere else

606
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,120
When her husband became an official, she followed her, etc.

607
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,480
This is called phantom

608
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,480
Or if the person she's marrying lives far away

609
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,680
Doesn't she have to go through a long and slow road before she can get married?

610
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,240
this is a distant marriage

611
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,880
Then when she got married

612
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,960
if she's going home to save time

613
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,880
feelings this may need you too

614
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,920
even in some special cases

615
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,360
she may live for

616
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,200
In order to maintain one's own livelihood

617
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,800
and have to go to different places to teach

618
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,480
Teach other people's children teach your students

619
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,200
This is the so-called belonging poem

620
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,040
What about an example like this?

621
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,620
Of course, there were many during the Ming and Qing Dynasties

622
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,920
there are even more unfortunate things

623
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,720
For example, if there is a war

624
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,160
Isn't that to escape?

625
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,760
In fact, escape is also a kind of travel

626
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,760
of course

627
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,080
We have a situation similar to our so-called tourism today.

628
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,200
that's still there

629
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,200
if not

630
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,000
We would not be in the Ming and Qing travel poetry groups

631
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,560
see those sights

632
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,960
Seeing the monuments and sending out feelings and so on works like this

633
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,200
And if we talk about the comparison below the middle level

634
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,000
words from lower class women

635
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,560
Their activities will also include such activities as entering the incense group

636
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,040
So in fact during the Ming and Qing Dynasties

637
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,400
Women can still go out

638
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,960
But today we will take one of them as an example.

639
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,560
in light this

640
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,560
There is a very famous literati in the world

641
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,840
Yuan Mei

642
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,120
That's more than eighteen people

643
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,200
This man certainly has all kinds of achievements.

644
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,480
but one thing

645
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,760
has always been the rear wheel

646
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,040
last until

647
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,560
or comparable

648
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,840
is that he has a habit

649
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,640
I just love accepting female disciples

650
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,440
I love hanging out with female students

651
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,020
After he stops being an official, of course he will be freer.

652
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,320
He lives in this random

653
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,680
He will go to various places, such as Hangzhou and Suzhou

654
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,500
Changshu, Songjiang, Zhengjiang, these places

655
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,040
Everywhere he goes

656
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,800
Those ones

657
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,600
recruited his name

658
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:36,880
this

659
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,440
The female students will come to him

660
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,480
to worship him as master

661
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,040
He will be very happy to say that they are apprentices

662
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:51,460
What about Yuan Mei? For these female disciples, this Chunyu is beautiful and very helpful to them.

663
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,240
finally

664
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,300
He also changed a book for his female disciples called

665
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,600
The female disciple who followed the fate lost the election

666
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,500
Of course they are not from the same place

667
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,600
I just mentioned a lot of place names

668
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,100
Although they are all in Jiangnan

669
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,400
These female disciples are actually scattered in different places

670
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,600
But they will make an appointment with the original media teacher to meet in Hangzhou

671
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
They made an appointment to go to Hangzhou from various places

672
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,800
Gather together at West Lake

673
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,300
And imitate male literati

674
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:32,000
Gather together in the form of West Lake elegant books to mention poems and sing

675
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,500
Then also solid professional people

676
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,100
Help them draw a picture of the situation they are dealing with

677
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,100
For example, you can see

678
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,300
which one to press

679
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,900
can you see an old man here

680
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,300
This should be the original medium

681
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:59,900
Then there are other women partying upstairs in West Lake

682
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,860
They later called this saying "Hu Lou Asking for Karma"

683
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:10,160
The poems they made at that time are also included in this collection

684
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,360
we can still see

685
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,300
Of course examples like this are definitely not everyday

686
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,820
It's not something that can happen every few days

687
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,720
But this example still shows

688
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,220
At that time, it was still possible for women of the home class to travel

689
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,940
In future generations, we are often subject to what we just said just now.

690
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,580
The effects of aging on the two sides

691
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,860
I thought this woman must never go out

692
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,060
It is a historical reality that is released from all over the world and accepted

693
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,980
But actually I think this is not quite accurate

694
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:51,380
Although the saying that Chinese women never travel is not very accurate

695
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,220
But at the level of discourse

696
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,060
women have to walk out

697
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,220
It is indeed a heart-to-heart exchange

698
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
one thing

699
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
we know popular literature

700
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
often best performing

701
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Some issues that people really care about

702
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
or a topic of interest

703
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
then we might as well

704
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Give some examples from popular literature

705
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Vice President Wang just introduced

706
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
my first in this field of study

707
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
women's literature of the Ming and Qing Dynasties

708
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Especially one created by women

709
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Novels with Yuwen titles

710
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Then it's called Tanci novel

711
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
let me talk for a minute

712
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
what's the word

713
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Tanci is originally a kind of musicality

714
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
very nice

715
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
a rap literature

716
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
this performer

717
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
One side is about to bounce

718
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Sanxian

719
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
or this person

720
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Pipa is in the lower left corner

721
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
rap and sing at the same time

722
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
to tell long stories

723
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
then this is in

724
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Jiangnan area is a kind of

725
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
very popular show

726
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
especially popular with women

727
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Then it was intentional at that time

728
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,120
some women who can read world characters

729
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,400
They took advantage of this particular form

730
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,720
to create a dark-headed

731
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,320
Can't really use it for performance

732
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,640
But you can watch it on your desk

733
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,360
fiction for reading

734
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,920
that's what i call this sting novel

735
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,520
So as you can see in the upper left corner

736
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,120
This is a creation left over from the late Qing Dynasty

737
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,920
Then you can see in the upper right corner

738
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,200
How much time has this woman spent in her life

739
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,880
It's really a lifetime to write a novel

740
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,760
This is their family heirloom handbook

741
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,280
So what about stabbing novels?

742
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,240
It basically uses the text to

743
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,120
Narrative in seven fonts

744
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,760
So it's above the form

745
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,280
Certainly different from what we're used to

746
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,760
Zhang Hui's novels in prose

747
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,480
It's like pulling a kettle in the Three Kingdoms

748
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,960
Journey to the West La Red Mansion these novels

749
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,920
but

750
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,480
Talking about stabbing novels also has Zhang Hui

751
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
The same tells the full story

752
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,840
Designs with characters and plots, etc.

753
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,120
so i think it's

754
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,120
In fact a novel

755
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,680
So

756
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,560
What about the talk novel written by this female department?

757
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,240
a large percentage

758
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,120
are telling a repeating story

759
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,920
Then change from this tone

760
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,800
what is this repeating story

761
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,960
That's what makes this story happen

762
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,600
The heroines in the little book must leave his specifications

763
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,680
He's been staying home so there's no story

764
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,040
he must leave home

765
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,240
then to the public world

766
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,320
so what to do

767
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,080
They must first dress up as men

768
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,800
they tie up their hair

769
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,520
to cover this piercing

770
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,200
to cover the little feet

771
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,800
put on men's boots

772
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,320
Then Mai Kaibuzi went out

773
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,600
where are you going

774
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,200
to the center of power

775
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,920
where is that

776
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,240
must be capital city

777
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,520
because they want to fulfill their dreams

778
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,720
You must first obtain citizenship

779
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,520
So these languages ​​are as exceptional

780
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,080
Their destination is the center of power

781
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:10,000
In Shenzhen, Meng Qianjun is like this. The female companion in men's clothes travels all the way from Yunnan to Beijing to take the exam.

782
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:19,000
For the heroines in such novels, their travels actually herald very drastic changes in their lives

783
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,000
They will play roles that only men in society should play for a long time

784
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,000
That is to be an official, a general, a parent, a husband, etc.

785
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And on their psychological level, these heroines hope that such a trip can go on forever

786
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
so their travel has a big change

787
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Well, of course, with our travel set, we also hope to increase their travel

788
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
that, of course, on their psychological level, these heroines hope that such a trip can go on forever

789
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
They will never need to go back to the norm to play the role of women in traditional society

790
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
chips their journey never has to end

791
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,800
The way we see it today, we can easily

792
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,060
It is easy to criticize these women writers

793
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,060
and the heroines they created

794
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:10,420
Because they're just daydreaming, right?

795
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:15,200
They never thought about resisting the system of traditional society

796
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,600
Never really reflect on gender roles

797
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,800
Is it so fixed or not?

798
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,700
Because these heroines they just want to be men

799
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:28,000
They didn't think about why the genders have such a division of labor

800
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,100
Is such criticism justified?

801
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,900
Of course it makes sense, indeed.

802
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,600
but i also want to ask

803
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:40,700
The women in these novels run away, the imagination of going out

804
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,600
Doesn't it represent a very deep spirit of pursuit?

805
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:50,300
Isn’t this a person worthy of our understanding today?

806
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,000
And a will to respect

807
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,100
And not precisely because women so long ago

808
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:00,000
a desire to have such an extreme pursuit

809
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,220
So after hundreds or hundreds of years to stimulate a new generation of women

810
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,840
For example, a woman like Lu Bicheng goes out

811
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,780
Then I think it is because of the novel about death written by Li Shiling

812
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:19,020
This exodus and this longing, this soul that seeks

813
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,480
expressed so strongly

814
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,500
So even in the novels about death written by Li Shi

815
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:33,060
There are also works that directly face the desire to go out and go out

816
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,560
the possible danger

817
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:40,080
Let's take a female work as an example

818
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,000
This work is Heaven and Flowers

819
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,560
The background of this talk about death is at the end of the Ming Dynasty

820
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,060
Then the plot of this novel is combined with the historical events of the last years of the Ming Dynasty

821
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,160
A family story with this

822
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,380
Then the plot is very rich

823
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,500
Of course it is impossible to explain to you here

824
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,060
But there is a very special place in this novel

825
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,800
It's that he keeps referring to women's going out

826
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
get out of this thing

827
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
we have just said

828
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,600
in the novel

829
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,500
If these hostesses don't leave the house

830
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,200
then there might be no story to tell

831
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,200
But Tianyuhua is special

832
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,400
Their heroine is at home

833
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,600
You can be a heroine without going out

834
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,000
And the whole thing wants to say

835
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,600
repeatedly warns his readers

836
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,600
The danger of this woman going out

837
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,200
There is a male protagonist in this novel

838
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
Zuo Weiming

839
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,200
Not Du Weiming Zuo Weiming

840
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,200
But he is a great Confucian hero

841
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Today's Great Hero

842
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,200
He's pretty solid that women can't go out

843
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
let's see what he said

844
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,200
This is Mr. Zuo Weiming Zuo

845
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,600
he was a teenager himself

846
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
When I was not married and still a single man

847
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
He ran to a consummation room by himself

848
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Tour in the garden

849
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
what about this time

850
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
he accidentally

851
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Met a girl who looks like a fairy

852
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And he heard the

853
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
This lady's name is Ring Green Turtle

854
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
You can know it with a turtle

855
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
should be in the tortoise

856
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
He went to see Miss Ring Green Turtle?

857
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
with his family

858
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Also play in the garden

859
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So Zuo Weiming thought in his heart

860
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
This green turtle

861
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Needless to say, talent and appearance

862
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
He is still the only one in the world

863
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
but just

864
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
he is a lady fairy

865
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Then he should stick to the door

866
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Should I steal my identity?

867
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
How can I play outside with my mother?

868
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
he went to peek by himself

869
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
How about a young and beautiful girl?

870
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But I scold him in my heart

871
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
can't come out

872
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
good

873
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
So

874
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
and after

875
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
this

876
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
once

877
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
he is on his way

878
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
he met his friend

879
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
this friend is a couple

880
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
what about the husband

881
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
because

882
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,440
At the request of my wife, I brought my wife out

883
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,320
Where do you go to burn incense when you go out?

884
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,720
go on a pilgrimage to the mountain

885
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,720
He was robbed by bandits on the way

886
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,760
Of course this beautiful lady almost lost her virginity

887
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,560
Fortunately, the great hero Zuo Weiming saved them

888
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,600
This is Zuo Ming's conclusion after saving them

889
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,280
Not what he considers his male friend

890
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,360
It's very embarrassing not being able to protect my wife

891
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,560
his conclusion is

892
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,080
It can be seen that Guiren can only be done in Guizhong

893
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,520
Can he go out in person?

894
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,360
look at

895
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,880
It's because you're running out

896
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,080
So today was hit by such a fire

897
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,400
you almost died

898
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,600
You almost ended up in this pack of wolves and tigers

899
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,240
There is no guarantee of the needle knot

900
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,320
this is his conclusion

901
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,480
because or

902
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,720
this

903
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,160
Later he got married

904
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,480
Miss Huang Qinghui who was criticized by him just now

905
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,200
later became his wife

906
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,240
then after marriage

907
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,640
The unfortunate Miss Huang said

908
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,760
I want to go home in two days

909
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,080
My mother said she would take me there

910
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
which garden to play

911
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,600
So this Zuo Weiming was furious

912
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,100
just tell him

913
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,000
This is something that doesn't exist in our house

914
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,400
Talking about mountains and playing with water is a man's business

915
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,200
definitely not something women do

916
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,600
That one can go outside

917
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,800
our family for generations

918
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,800
No one has ever done such a shameful thing

919
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,800
This is Zuo Weiming in Tian and Hua

920
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,900
He represents a spirit of this novel

921
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,600
one he showed

922
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,000
Restricting movement of women going out

923
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,700
an idea

924
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,100
and more interestingly

925
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,800
This Zuo Weiming

926
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,300
Not only does he have to take care of his wife

927
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,000
Of course he wants to take care of his daughter

928
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,500
Not only can his daughter not go out

929
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
to explore the garden outside

930
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,800
I can't even go to my own back garden.

931
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,000
Why can't you go to your own back garden?

932
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,700
Of course you can imagine

933
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,500
How did the story of Wu Dantian happen?

934
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,500
The back garden is a very dangerous place

935
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,400
In fact, when his own daughter

936
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,500
by order of the father

937
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
A lot of things went to the back garden

938
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It's true that something unfortunate happened

939
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Because they met the flower spirit tree monster in the garden

940
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
want to rape them, seduce them

941
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Luckily his big baby is very heroic

942
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
As soon as I saw it, I got rid of these golden monsters in the garden

943
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
But the question is why is the novel written like this?

944
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
when i am alone

945
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
this garden is a special place

946
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
The garden was originally a specification within a home

947
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
An end point with the outside world

948
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
is a very vaguely defined place

949
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
in this story

950
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
The garden is a place that is about to run out

951
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
In fact, it means that the woman wants to poke her head out.

952
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
That deep desire to go outside

953
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
only in the novel

954
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
This woman's desire is suppressed

955
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
was beheaded

956
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I think if you look at it this way

957
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
The sky and the flowers are actually from the back

958
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It expresses the heart of women running away and pursuing

959
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
"Star World"

960
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
women's novels write about their education

961
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
What about the man?

962
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Let's take another example of a male work

963
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
There is a very special novel in the early Qing Dynasty

964
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's called "The Biography of Acting English"

965
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
You know this is a talk

966
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Very Scary Story of Father Han

967
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
The Novel's Travels to Women

968
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
made a very special description

969
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
A scholar once analyzed for us

970
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
The heroine in "The Biography of Acting in English"

971
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It's Han's father named Xue Sujie

972
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
He went out four times in his life

973
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
The experience of traveling to distant places

974
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
The first time was to go to Mount Tai to burn incense

975
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
second time to beijing

976
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
The third time to Huai'an

977
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The fourth time to go to Chengdu

978
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
The next three times are to go

979
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
In order to find his drunk driving husband

980
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
good

981
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So

982
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So

983
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Then this scholar mentioned that

984
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,600
in the biographies of entertainers

985
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,720
The male author will constantly question

986
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,520
And mocking a woman's ability to take care of herself outside

987
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,280
want to cut vegetarian sister

988
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,560
Even if he walks the avenue at home

989
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,920
make the husband kneel at his feet

990
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,160
but as soon as you go out

991
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,240
he is a helpless man

992
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,880
So let's take a look at this Miao Xian

993
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,880
This is the 73rd chapter I want to talk about

994
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,880
It's just talking about burning incense on Mount Tai

995
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,320
You can take a look

996
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,440
this small

997
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,800
Inside, there will be Miao Xian, who burns incense on Mount Tai.

998
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,080
this lively situation

999
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,080
This is the Jade Emperor Biography Meeting on March 3

1000
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,560
Then this Mount Tai is full of people

1001
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,640
impenetrable

1002
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,760
and what is this dangerous

1003
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,760
mixed sex in this place

1004
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,120
There is no way to say that males are on one side and females are on the other.

1005
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,160
And it's not divided into two

1006
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,720
So regardless of gender

1007
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,520
Or classes are all confused

1008
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,680
such a situation

1009
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,680
Only those public officials who take risks

1010
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,720
And those countless wives

1011
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,480
Who will be innumerable

1012
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,040
The wives are counted

1013
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,040
countless wives

1014
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,460
Just without a husband and without a home

1015
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,520
bad women and so on

1016
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,320
Then you will be paired and haunted

1017
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,320
There is no gentleman who is educated and reasonable

1018
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,120
Or the woman with the hand knot

1019
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,080
will appear here

1020
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,520
Then he described below

1021
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,600
describe this woman woman

1022
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,720
Where is the danger in such a place?

1023
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,640
after this ridge number

1024
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,880
He said, these are the vagrants

1025
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,880
Whenever you see a woman coming

1026
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,760
she wants ice cream without glasses

1027
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,480
pointing

1028
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
Then there are constant comments in the mouth

1029
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,920
comment on what

1030
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,800
commented that

1031
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,440
Oh, this man's hair is so shiny.

1032
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,480
what about that person

1033
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,000
Yo this foot is so small

1034
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,040
It's beautiful

1035
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,720
Or that this person can't

1036
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,840
too much powder

1037
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,880
face is pale

1038
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,200
He also said that the oil was not enough.

1039
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,120
this person is very dry

1040
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,320
I said this mouth is too big

1041
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,520
terrible eating too much

1042
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,280
Well, this ass is too big, right?

1043
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,480
Didn't get up to do anything?

1044
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
Wait, you are constantly criticizing

1045
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,160
women on the road

1046
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,840
what about these women

1047
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,440
even if they are together

1048
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,000
but they

1049
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,560
completely incapable of protecting oneself

1050
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,960
Then I won't quote

1051
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,040
because at the end of this episode

1052
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,560
It's actually a very dire situation

1053
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,400
That means

1054
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,800
A bunch of wealthy people centered on Shasujie

1055
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,880
When passing by this group of floating children

1056
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,240
because they said something wrong

1057
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,800
Offended this group of bad boys

1058
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,560
They came forward and not only called these women

1059
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,920
And stripped all their clothes

1060
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,000
These women

1061
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,640
The last is to be naked when going up this mountain

1062
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,240
It's like being insulted

1063
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,320
as the end of this episode

1064
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,160
then it's clear

1065
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,480
what about this place

1066
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,360
What is manifested is

1067
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:48,080
A Danger of Women Walking Out of Homes and into Crowds

1068
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,600
Then of course it was that era

1069
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,560
For this woman likes to burn incense

1070
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,880
pilgrimage

1071
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,000
A Criticism of the Habit

1072
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,960
Then it is very obvious that

1073
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,840
A male author's warning for women traveling

1074
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,440
But whatever we just saw

1075
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,220
Lessons from Tianyuhua

1076
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,520
or in the form of male authors here

1077
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,820
This comparison game pen in English

1078
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,880
He actually corresponds to

1079
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,200
Did women in society at that time really have a chance to step out of the house?

1080
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,520
They really have the opportunity to participate in the activities of the public

1081
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,800
it's a reality

1082
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,140
If it's not true because some women

1083
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,720
I will go to public gardens to enjoy with my family

1084
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,060
If it wasn't true some women would be in the Mirror Corps

1085
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,100
Then these popular novels

1086
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,420
He doesn't have to express such great anxiety and resistance.

1087
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:40,960
actually

1088
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,780
Whether these are real

1089
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,580
To deter women they go on a tour

1090
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:47,880
Denmin filed

1091
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,660
or dissatisfaction

1092
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,020
Or ordinary class women who go to temples to burn incense

1093
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,300
or even

1094
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,580
Female writers like Peng's novels are in the novels

1095
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,860
to imagine a woman

1096
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,540
What kind of travel alone

1097
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,580
I think it shows

1098
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:06,400
Chinese women before modern times

1099
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,480
their timeless

1100
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,320
A Common One Desire Across Regions

1101
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,380
that's the desire to get out

1102
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,960
destination of travel

1103
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,260
What is there to see

1104
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,300
It seems that it is not the point

1105
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:28,160
The point is to be able to go beyond the original boundaries and limitations

1106
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:32,000
Of course, under the constraints of the social environment at that time

1107
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,100
Women's travel experience and women's imagination of travel

1108
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:40,200
It makes us feel that it is actually very precious.

1109
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,040
Okay, so during the Ming and Qing Dynasties we used this

1110
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,360
A few brief examples to introduce to you

1111
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,680
Going further down, to the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Ming Dynasty

1112
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,960
Of course it's different

1113
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,320
Women's travel opportunities in this era have increased a lot

1114
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,600
don't talk too much

1115
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,600
Just mentioned female students

1116
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Sometimes there have been female students

1117
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
She is going abroad to study

1118
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
even study abroad

1119
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
if only

1120
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It's very possible to go to school.

1121
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
to lady

1122
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Of course we also remember

1123
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Liu Bichang went to Tianjin for the first time

1124
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
just to study

1125
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
exist

1126
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
When Qing Ruo

1127
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
around the beginning of the twentieth century

1128
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
We also finally saw

1129
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
first step

1130
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
by dedicated women

1131
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
written by

1132
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
foreign mail

1133
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
wife of a diplomat

1134
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Written by Shanshini

1135
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
ghost hair travel post

1136
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
This is from 1903

1137
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
She later wrote another

1138
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It's called "Return to the Front" in 1910

1139
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
out

1140
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
the lady

1141
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Goodness, she's actually

1142
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
her post is special

1143
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
So the last ten years

1144
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
received

1145
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,600
considerable academic attention

1146
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,000
His husband is called Qin Xun

1147
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,800
Is a diplomat in the late Qing Dynasty

1148
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,200
went to many places to have accidents

1149
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,700
since 1889

1150
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,900
Shan Shilin followed his husband

1151
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,200
Traveled to many places

1152
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,700
Shan Shilin because he is a destination

1153
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,600
He took what he had seen and heard

1154
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,700
And his thoughts were written and mailed

1155
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,000
And he writes a big point of mailing

1156
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,900
It is to encourage women in China at that time to speak

1157
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,500
imitate his spirit

1158
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,500
Travel abroad to broaden your knowledge

1159
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:43,300
These two parts mailed the previous part of Mandarin

1160
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:47,900
It's about his experience in Japan and Russia

1161
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:52,100
The second part of Homecoming is basically about countries in Western Europe

1162
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:56,200
we have to pay special attention

1163
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,100
It is because of good deeds, Lin's historical environment, his career

1164
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Wanqing is special

1165
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,000
So he writes the post with a special perspective

1166
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
what kind of perspective

1167
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
The first is that he is a woman

1168
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
He is going with his peers

1169
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Chinese woman speaking with dream

1170
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
The second is that he is a Chinese woman

1171
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
The third point is

1172
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
He is a woman in China who is being bullied by foreign powers

1173
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
so you can see

1174
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
For example, he would say this in "He You Ji"

1175
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
He will say that our Chinese women are originally locked up

1176
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
So we never know the outside world

1177
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Because I don't know the outside world

1178
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So we don't actually know ourselves

1179
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Because I have never seen foreign countries

1180
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
So I don't know ours is actually called China

1181
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
This is mutually defined

1182
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So he said that since I went to Japan

1183
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I see Japanese women are very patriotic

1184
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
So I was also inspired

1185
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I know we women need it too

1186
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,760
patriotic this is important to the country

1187
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,160
Then I also spontaneously gave birth to patriotism

1188
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,160
which of course encourages his potential female readers

1189
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,960
Even women should be governed by national concepts

1190
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,840
Well, this is a good deed that leaves blood

1191
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,720
A more important main axis in the mail

1192
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,240
Of course, he is also a woman who is full of knowledge.

1193
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,560
I heard that Tolstoy was sent by him from China

1194
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,600
So I haven't gone through a very strict inspection

1195
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,560
Do not know is not true

1196
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,160
But it is said

1197
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,720
He was the first person in China to mention

1198
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,160
This Russian writer Tolstoy's people

1199
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,440
OK

1200
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,520
good

1201
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:49,200
However, this good deed is from him, although he is a woman who looks up to the original owner

1202
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,880
but what do we have to say

1203
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:57,360
He will basically still be classified by us as a home of the Qing Dynasty

1204
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,920
How should I put it, he is still in

1205
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,560
Continuing the oil change tradition we just mentioned

1206
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,900
Why did he have the opportunity to travel abroad?

1207
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,600
That's because he went abroad with his husband

1208
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,800
So he is a follower role

1209
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,320
He played the role of a wife in a family to go abroad

1210
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,240
then maybe a little later

1211
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,720
We have a character for comparison

1212
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:31,320
This figure may be even more legendary in terms of travel

1213
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,640
who is this

1214
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:38,040
This is Kang Youwei's second daughter

1215
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,840
Kang Tongbi

1216
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:47,680
Kang Tongbi is also a person from the end of the 19th century to the 20th century

1217
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,560
He is Kang Youwei's second daughter

1218
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,760
If you have read Zhang Yihe's The Last Noble

1219
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,560
maybe remember

1220
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,240
Because it actually mentioned in that book

1221
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,000
Kang Tongbi in his later years and Kang Tongbi's daughter

1222
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,960
That Luo Yifeng

1223
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,960
So what kind of legendary trip did he have?

1224
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,880
That was in the spring of 1902

1225
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,320
Has the reform already failed?

1226
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,520
So that Kang Youwei has gone out of town

1227
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,440
to many places

1228
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,960
Finally, in 1902, Kang Youwei was here

1229
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,840
From Southeast Asia to India

1230
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,280
Well, Kang Tongbi is not yet 20 years old at this time

1231
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,600
this is 19 years old

1232
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,600
After he found out where his father was

1233
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,040
I decided to rush to accompany my father to take care of him.

1234
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,200
So it is said that he is wearing men's clothes

1235
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,880
then alone

1236
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,320
Go south from this Hexi Corridor

1237
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,840
Then through Nanyang

1238
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:50,120
In the end he really went to India to accompany his father Kang Youwei

1239
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,440
So how do we know this?

1240
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,960
Because Liang Qichao used to be here

1241
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,200
It was mentioned in Hidden Soldiers Relief

1242
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,080
Then he will talk about Kang Tong

1243
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Last year, a person went to India to torture

1244
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
He is only 19 years old

1245
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
This is actually a little bit sexist.

1246
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Young age is not necessarily good job

1247
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
But he praised Kang Tongbi for being able to

1248
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Blind Tao Accounting for Thousands of Miles

1249
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
It's really rich and has no dogs

1250
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
The comparison between this young and professional and the rich but without dogs

1251
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It's actually quite an interesting value judgment.

1252
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
After telling the story

1253
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Liang Qichao also quoted two poems by Kang Tongbi

1254
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
These are the two poems you see below

1255
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
This is the word count of Kang Dongpil

1256
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
He said that social mountains and rivers are formed

1257
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
A society is of course a social state

1258
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It was a place name in India at that time.

1259
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
society city

1260
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
That's where the Buddha preached the scriptures and preached the Dharma.

1261
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Sanxun

1262
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
If you don't pass, you don't pass the temple

1263
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It is also the place where the Buddha preached

1264
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
The tone below is very red

1265
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
he said bad lady rare

1266
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I am the first person

1267
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
it's very very confident

1268
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
very strong tone

1269
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Believe that you can do it

1270
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
first chinese woman

1271
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Of course, these two poems both show a very gray and red momentum.

1272
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
after this

1273
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Kang Tongbi became a wife again in 1903

1274
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Actually went to America to study

1275
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Finally in 1909 when

1276
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
from Columbia University

1277
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
He had no way of going to the real columbia at that time

1278
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
He can only go to women's college

1279
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
It's Bernard

1280
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
he graduated from there

1281
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
He's actually a Colombian woman

1282
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,420
Girls college's first graduate Asian student

1283
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,000
This is Kang Tongbi's trip

1284
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,700
Of course we have to say that Kang Tongbi has an extraordinary background

1285
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,700
After all, he is Kang Youwei's daughter

1286
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,000
his extraordinary family background

1287
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
In fact, it created his extraordinary experience

1288
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
But his whole travel experience

1289
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Let's say he wants a man of his own volition

1290
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
so far away

1291
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
really thousands of miles away

1292
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
India to save Qing

1293
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
It is also from the kind of women I just mentioned

1294
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
the desire to get out

1295
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
a will to seek

1296
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
in fact

1297
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Kang Tongbi and Lu Bicheng

1298
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
They were all born in the 1880s

1299
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
So they can be said to be peers

1300
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Then they are also in the youthful temple age of life

1301
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
did something special

1302
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Kang Tongbi traveled thousands of miles to India to save

1303
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,400
Wake up and study abroad

1304
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,300
And Bi Chen is about the same age

1305
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,500
Run away from home, go to Tianjin to explore the world

1306
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,700
Their travels all started

1307
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,200
Some special experiences in their personal lives

1308
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,200
They are also famous historical environments in the late Qing Dynasty

1309
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,000
create an environment for them

1310
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,400
such an opportunity

1311
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,800
Of course, the end of the Qing Dynasty also began to appear

1312
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,600
more female students

1313
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,000
They go far and wide to read

1314
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,400
including the heroines we are familiar with

1315
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,300
Qiu Jin is also around this time

1316
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,900
Those who went abroad to study, those who went to Japan to study

1317
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,300
so we can see

1318
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,600
from this time on

1319
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:46,200
Chinese women have more and more opportunities to travel abroad

1320
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,600
so from here

1321
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,700
we can finally go back

1322
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,400
Al Bichen's body

1323
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,400
And her trip to Europe and America

1324
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,200
What about Al Bichen's trip?

1325
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:00,300
in a special historical context

1326
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
in the late 1920s

1327
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
What about this period?

1328
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
What kind of period was it?

1329
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
For Lu Bicheng

1330
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
His origin is China

1331
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
His destination is Europe and America

1332
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
So the date in the 1920s

1333
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
for China

1334
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
For Europe and the United States

1335
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
different meanings

1336
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
The year he set out was 1926

1337
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
in China

1338
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
what year was that

1339
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
it was 1930

1340
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
in China

1341
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
what year was that

1342
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
that's exactly

1343
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
It was the year when the Beifa Movement started

1344
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
So

1345
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
where he goes

1346
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
where is his destination

1347
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
In Europe and America?

1348
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
What about the 1920s?

1349
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
yes

1350
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Simply put, the 1920s were

1351
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
World War I

1352
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
postwar period

1353
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Because the year of the European War

1354
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
1914 to 1918

1355
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
then the 1920s

1356
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,400
It was after the end of the European War in 1918

1357
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,040
a special period

1358
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,840
Caught in the European War in the 1920s

1359
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,800
Followed by the 1930s

1360
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,040
For example, during the Great Depression in the United States

1361
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:19,240
So when it comes to the European War

1362
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,440
We must say this World War I

1363
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,840
Impact on the Western world

1364
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:29,400
It's indescribably huge

1365
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,320
I myself have actually read

1366
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,200
Because I used to study in the Department of Chinese Literature

1367
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,680
Actually read a lot of literature

1368
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,920
But I'm really late

1369
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,000
Only then did I really realize that there are so many things that are

1370
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,840
Why is it so similar to World War I?

1371
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,560
so relevant

1372
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,600
then

1373
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,720
What about World War I?

1374
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,400
It's because of this twentieth-century advance in weapons

1375
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,280
so amazing

1376
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,200
So it caused this

1377
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,920
The casualties far exceed the casualty rate of wars that humans could have imagined before.

1378
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:10,200
Moreover, the First World War also invented a very special method of warfare

1379
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,400
It's what you see in the picture

1380
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,200
This is Trench, the so-called Haogou Warfare

1381
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,800
That is to say, the people on both sides have spent many months this year.

1382
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:23,160
This year, I have been preparing for the battle in Haogou for many months.

1383
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:29,000
So for a very, very long time soldiers have to stay in this

1384
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,120
then they can't get out

1385
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,440
It's really stuck inside and can't get out

1386
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:38,240
Moreover, the sky you look up at is incomplete.

1387
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:42,560
Looking up, you can only see a thin line of sky above Haogou

1388
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,840
Even days are incomplete

1389
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:48,960
Then according to the conjecture of later generations?

1390
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,520
a war experience like this

1391
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:56,360
For the psychology of the soldiers who participated in the war at that time

1392
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,400
had a very, very large impact

1393
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,400
is a huge battle

1394
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
window pain

1395
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
So

1396
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
and therefore in this

1397
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
after the first event war

1398
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
we can almost say

1399
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
too many important

1400
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
this western literary work

1401
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
World War I

1402
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
caused by the psychological

1403
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Trauma is relevant

1404
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I just give a few examples

1405
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Although this is already

1406
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
History learned a very long time ago

1407
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
but for example

1408
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
This is probably the one we are most familiar with

1409
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Elliott

1410
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
T.S. Eliot

1411
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Some of his most important works such as

1412
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Wasteland

1413
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
or this

1414
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
What is the name Hollow Man or Hollow Man?

1415
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
The Hollow Man

1416
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
It's all from the 1920s

1417
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
And it's all

1418
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
In response to this European war

1419
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
some spirit

1420
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
state

1421
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
For example, this wasteland is supposed to be in 1922

1422
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
then this

1423
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Hollow Man's might be a little later

1424
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,560
1925

1425
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,360
Another example is the American writer Hemingway

1426
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,280
his battlefield dream

1427
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,480
Haruka battlefield is this

1428
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,040
Affair to Arms

1429
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,640
He is also talking about himself

1430
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,120
Some of the First World War

1431
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:19,600
this traumatic experience the sense of absurdity of war and more

1432
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,320
That's 1929

1433
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,240
These are all works from the 1920s

1434
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,640
what they responded to

1435
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,440
All from 1914 to 1918

1436
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,520
this world war one

1437
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,600
then these works

1438
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,440
they all have something in common

1439
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,720
have some themes

1440
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,160
they all acted

1441
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,600
the generation after the war in europe

1442
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,960
the psychological feeling

1443
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,880
lost hopeless

1444
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,880
disillusioned disillusioned

1445
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,720
The collapse of this value

1446
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,080
everything in the world is meaningless

1447
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,760
such a state of mind

1448
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,800
It's just like

1449
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,400
This is what Elliot's Holloman said

1450
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,400
He just said we were empty

1451
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,880
there is nothing in us

1452
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,200
Even if there is something, it's just stuffed with straw

1453
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,840
like a stuff animal

1454
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,640
It's stuffed there, it's stuck there

1455
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,040
There are straws in the head

1456
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,440
nothing

1457
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,280
And what?

1458
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,520
It's just like

1459
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,560
It's just like

1460
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,880
This tangible and intangible thing is the same

1461
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,840
I think this picture is very

1462
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,960
for me

1463
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,520
Very meaningful expression of that feeling

1464
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,200
yes

1465
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,880
like this floating shadow

1466
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,040
is colorless

1467
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,440
is powerless

1468
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,840
You see it seems to be moving

1469
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,160
In fact, it has no power at all.

1470
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,560
there is no motion

1471
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,640
so finally

1472
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,480
What about the end of this poem?

1473
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,120
just say

1474
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,760
this is how the world ends

1475
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,040
This is the way the world ends

1476
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,240
Not with a band

1477
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,640
I didn't even think about it

1478
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,920
how did this world end

1479
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,520
just use

1480
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,640
softly

1481
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,720
Humper is a

1482
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,280
Wu Ye or wrong gas

1483
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,440
small sound

1484
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,160
no sense to end with a sound

1485
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,000
this reminds me

1486
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
From "Dragon Dream"

1487
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Yuan Xiaojie passed

1488
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,600
There is still a touch

1489
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,800
nothing

1490
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:10,600
But in this wild world

1491
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:14,400
Even Yuan Xiaojie's swollen sound

1492
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,000
none

1493
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,200
So this is what the Western world calls

1494
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,200
A Portrayal of the Spirit of the Lost Generation

1495
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,200
This is the so-called spiritual wasteland

1496
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:32,200
This is the side on the window from the 1920s

1497
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,200
but on the other hand

1498
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,200
What about America in the 1920s?

1499
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,600
It was a prosperous golden age

1500
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,600
What about other big cities in the western world?

1501
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,600
including London and Paris

1502
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:51,000
And what about New York in the United States, and big cities like Chicago?

1503
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,400
What they actually experienced was a

1504
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,000
we call it crazy sales

1505
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,800
Crazy

1506
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,800
era of frenzied sales

1507
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,520
It was a very noisy time

1508
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,200
in this era

1509
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:13,160
There are some social and cultural peculiarities in the 2000s

1510
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:16,440
For example, if we're going to talk about art

1511
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,680
It is an era of so-called Art Deco

1512
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:22,840
Features of Art Deco

1513
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,560
For example, as you can see in the picture in the middle

1514
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,160
there are many colors

1515
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,680
There are many geometric lines

1516
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,720
influenced by industrial civilization

1517
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:35,880
So those more mechanical designs that appeared

1518
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,360
You can see it on the clothes

1519
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,400
The hat worn by the woman in the lower left corner

1520
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,280
It's what you want to describe a woman as a smoker

1521
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,200
This is the smoke room girl

1522
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,600
It's also the age of movies

1523
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,760
Choplin was active in that era

1524
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:54,320
An era when Hollywood movies first flourished

1525
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,720
At the same time it is Jazz Age

1526
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,600
it's time for jazz month

1527
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,480
jazz month useful

1528
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Yes, there are five

1529
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Then he also includes this

1530
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
An Era of Nightclub Nightlife

1531
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
then at the same time

1532
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
He is also the one seen in the upper left corner

1533
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
between men and women

1534
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
one era

1535
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Let's take a look at some sounds

1536
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I can feel the feeling of that era

1537
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Please bear with me

1538
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
advertise

1539
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
four seconds will continue at last

1540
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
advertise

1541
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
this is

1542
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Some Foreshadowings of Paris in the 1920s

1543
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:27,200
OK, let's see this

1544
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:39,560
Okay, what about the nightlife we ​​just mentioned, let's take a look

1545
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:46,240
How does Jazz Age behave in this NightCog?

1546
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
This is the sound of the 20th-century Jazz Age.

1547
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,000
If you want to see more colourful images of the 20th-century,

1548
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I suggest you to go back to the movies you've watched recently.

1549
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
The new film, The Big Red Cross, was released in 2020.

1550
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Of course, this is basically the poster of the movie.

1551
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
You can see the background of it.

1552
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,300
It is a design of Art Deco

1553
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,500
The entire font is characteristic of that era

1554
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,700
The one below is actually his still photo I posted.

1555
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:13,000
We can also be very clear in the stills

1556
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:17,200
Just see his whole color woman image

1557
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:20,800
life inside the picture inside

1558
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,800
The kind that can be conveyed in this picture

1559
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:27,200
decadent indulgence very sensual

1560
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:31,700
Then it is actually a world with a very dead, floating atmosphere.

1561
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:38,500
And behind him, there is actually an absurd person in the heart.

1562
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,200
self-imposed exile

1563
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:47,400
There is also a mental state that breaks with tradition

1564
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:54,300
This is the background of the 1920s when Lu Bicheng traveled to Europe and America

1565
01:08:54,300 --> 01:09:00,100
Such a prosperous and smooth scene is not the same as that of modern people.

1566
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,900
Xinning's barren thorns jointly built the Western European and American world in the 1920s

1567
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:10,800
Well, at least in the United States until this and that Wall Street Crash in 1929

1568
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:14,200
That's why such a world collapsed

1569
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:18,100
Then after that, it will be the long-term Great Depression era of the American economy.

1570
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:22,800
So, when Lu Micheng went to Europe and America to roam

1571
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:27,300
Most of the time he is in such a situation

1572
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:30,900
This is a case of his destination

1573
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:35,200
Then I think the reason why Lu Bicheng is in his travel notes

1574
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:39,600
Often expresses a very melancholy mood

1575
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:45,200
There is also a feeling of boredom and vulgarity.

1576
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:52,800
On the other hand, he has a kind of sincerity for luxury, beauty, luxury, splendor, etc.

1577
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,700
These two emotions exist at the same time

1578
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:00,000
Well, I think it's not just about his own personal

1579
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
For example, his family is considered unfortunate.

1580
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
For example, his health is obviously not good.

1581
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
He always thinks he's dying

1582
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
wait for such factors

1583
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
In fact, it also has something to do with the general environment of the place he visited.

1584
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
are closely related

1585
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
The overall atmosphere is just like his soul

1586
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
What about the feeling?

1587
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
I feel empathy

1588
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
are echoes of each other

1589
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
So let's read this now

1590
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
What about Lu Bicheng's European and American Man You Road?

1591
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I think our readers at the same time as him

1592
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
It's like getting a little bit of a bargain

1593
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Because we are looking at that time from modern times

1594
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
we can see

1595
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
We can see the feeling of that whole era from behind

1596
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
And what about Lu Bicheng and his contemporary readers?

1597
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
It may not feel like this

1598
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
to feel his emotions

1599
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
This relationship with his environment

1600
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
So this post-construction name is still better.

1601
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
well then

1602
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,600
Because Chinese women sold oil alone in Europe and America in the 1920s

1603
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,160
except of her own will

1604
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,480
What other factors can support her?

1605
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:14,080
Then I have to pull Lu Bicheng back to

1606
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:18,180
Consider it within the context of her own era

1607
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:19,960
Then in this China

1608
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:24,320
In fact, as early as the 1910s in magazines

1609
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,140
Mailing is a very important column

1610
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:30,220
Many magazines will have a mailing column

1611
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:32,520
Everyone likes to watch other people travel and you know why

1612
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:37,900
What about magazines, in fact, they are often read in women's mail

1613
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,420
in particular

1614
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,980
I like looking at the lights

1615
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:44,800
schoolgirl mail

1616
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,340
schoolgirl's work

1617
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:50,440
Then of course the female student won't go anywhere far with his post

1618
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:53,000
For example, when we were young, we all wrote Yangmingshan mail, right?

1619
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,280
almost like that

1620
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,840
But others are a postal

1621
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:00,120
He will become a school for girls

1622
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Composition education is an important part of his education.

1623
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
This fact itself represents

1624
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
From the relationship with women to the previous generation

1625
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
is completely different

1626
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
We'll see all kinds of women's mailings in magazines

1627
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Or it includes women's feelings after going out for a swim

1628
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Let's say I see a record that is

1629
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
A first generation Liu Mei's schoolgirl

1630
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
He wrote that when he returned to China and disembarked

1631
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Set foot on the land of Shanghai, that mess

1632
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
put him down

1633
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,000
This in turn is a cultural fine-fork sense

1634
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
will happen

1635
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Women's Mail of the 1910s in This Era

1636
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
In fact, some of them are very good and quite unique.

1637
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
For example, the author of this article is called Ji Zonglan

1638
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
What you guys see here is him on

1639
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Volume 11 of the Women's Magazine

1640
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
That is, December 1915

1641
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
December

1642
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,600
A mailing by me is called "Yue Shan Ji"

1643
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,300
what about this article

1644
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:08,500
In fact, the structure is very complete

1645
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:12,000
He talked about this natural landscape

1646
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,400
He spoke of what he observed as a problem with social prestige

1647
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:19,900
Then he also mentioned some of his historical feelings in Guanlaoyu

1648
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:22,500
So what can we say about this woman's insight?

1649
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,400
actually quite remarkable

1650
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,500
So at the end of this article

1651
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,600
what about the author

1652
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:31,500
Ji Zonglan said very confidently

1653
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,100
what about my trip

1654
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,400
Learn from it

1655
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,400
learn while traveling

1656
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,300
this is a purposeful trip

1657
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:43,300
I'm not like those boring people in Shanghai, am I?

1658
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,300
I only run horses every day.

1659
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,700
watch a play what?

1660
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:48,000
steamed and sea

1661
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,900
those who are useless

1662
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:50,800
i am useful

1663
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,300
My study and travel are combined

1664
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,200
This is Ji Zonglan

1665
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,800
he is very firm

1666
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,200
learn from travel

1667
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Inquiry equates travel with knowledge

1668
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
So who is Ji Zonglan?

1669
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Ji Zonglan was a female educator in the early Ming Dynasty

1670
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
This is the same as Lu Bicheng's early identification

1671
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
So special is Ji Zonglan

1672
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
He actually has another post

1673
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
It's called Guilin Travel Notes

1674
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
It was also published in the same magazine

1675
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
It's volume four, number six, of women's magazines.

1676
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
That is, in June 1918

1677
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Then this post

1678
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
later renamed

1679
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Renamed as Guilin Post

1680
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Is received ancient and modern mail from the inside

1681
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
His writing is the same as the past and present

1682
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Mailing with the Eight Great Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties

1683
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Put it together, rise up, sit up

1684
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
good

1685
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
then we can see something like this

1686
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
We take this post by Ji Zonglan as a representative

1687
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,000
This category of this early twentieth century woman's mailing

1688
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
they did it on purpose

1689
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,400
Demonstrate knowledge, study, enlightenment, view of current affairs, view of history, etc.

1690
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:10,640
Positive going with this big one

1691
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,880
Some viewpoints corresponding to the trend

1692
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,000
a positive spirit

1693
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,800
We just talked about the characteristics of this era in the 1920s

1694
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,400
So what about events in Europe and America?

1695
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,840
The 1920s happened to be the tourism industry

1696
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,680
A period of particularly developed leaps and bounds

1697
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,280
In this day and age, I was supposed to travel abroad

1698
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,400
Not so common yet, in the 20's

1699
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,480
more and more popular

1700
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,480
What about Lubi City's roaming?

1701
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:42,200
It can also be said that it is a victory

1702
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,400
Just came across the tourism industry

1703
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,880
The booming period of international tourism

1704
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,240
we can see

1705
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:52,440
What about Lu Bicheng after he arrived in Europe and America?

1706
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:56,440
Along the way, I took, for example, this transoceanic ship.

1707
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,640
He's even been on a plane

1708
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,040
Then every time he arrives

1709
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Where did the travel agency go to book tickets?

1710
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
to send luggage

1711
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,500
accept luggage

1712
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,000
or exchange money

1713
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,700
he will use

1714
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,800
modern tourism services

1715
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:11,800
for example

1716
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,800
For example, what is this Kirk?

1717
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,000
This Thomas Cook

1718
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,600
or American Express

1719
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,000
We still use this travel service

1720
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
At that time, Lu Bi's achievements were already in use

1721
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,700
And he highly recommends

1722
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,200
If you want to travel

1723
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,000
Be sure to use these travel industry services

1724
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,500
These make his journey

1725
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,500
even traveling alone

1726
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:36,500
Traveling alone is also convenient

1727
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,500
Then the same period

1728
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,500
how is the situation in china

1729
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,500
For the first time in Lu Bicheng

1730
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:46,000
Announced in the newspaper that he was going to start

1731
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,500
When traveling in Europe and America

1732
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,500
he mentioned

1733
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,000
My post

1734
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
after writing it out

1735
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
can be the guide of the people

1736
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
It can be used as a reference for Chinese people to go abroad

1737
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Since he said so

1738
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,900
Of course, it was expected that Chinese people at that time would also have the opportunity to travel abroad like him.

1739
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,200
Well in fact it is

1740
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:11,000
since 1927

1741
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:15,620
Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank they set up a travel department

1742
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,460
started publishing a magazine called a travel magazine

1743
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,000
This is his release

1744
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:23,560
This travel magazine is actually published by him

1745
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:26,360
very long release period

1746
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:30,460
Published from 1927 until 1954

1747
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:35,840
This travel magazine is mainly for Chinese readers

1748
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:39,420
Provide various domestic and foreign travel information

1749
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:40,960
first magazine

1750
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:45,820
Of course, it is a product of the consumer culture in Shanghai in the 1920s

1751
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:50,420
His founder, Chen Guangfu, must be very sharp

1752
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,220
discover to travel

1753
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:53,500
will be

1754
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,780
It will be a promising industry in the future

1755
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:57,680
so he

1756
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:58,320
not only

1757
01:17:58,580 --> 01:17:59,860
Founded a travel magazine

1758
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:06,200
And also formally applied for the establishment of China Travel Agency

1759
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,000
that is Chinese

1760
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Really the first travel agency in China

1761
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,500
It can be seen that in modern China

1762
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,200
The development of tourism in the 1920s

1763
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:21,000
In fact, it did not fall behind the West

1764
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:27,000
We can take a look at this is a travel advertisement in a travel magazine

1765
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
they have routes to europe

1766
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
There are airlines to the United States, and all countries in the world fly

1767
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:38,000
He can help you arrange luxury trains, tours, etc.

1768
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:43,000
So I believe that it is a good idea for readers

1769
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Just sit at home and watch

1770
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
is also very attractive

1771
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I think the look of the travel magazine has witnessed

1772
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
A development of Chinese tourism

1773
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
In the 18th year of the Republic of China, that is, in 1929

1774
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,560
When Bicheng was still roaming

1775
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:07,160
What about this travel magazine in three volumes and six issues?

1776
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:08,440
i found one

1777
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,240
very interesting material

1778
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,520
then it is

1779
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,320
travel magazine announced

1780
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,100
they sponsor a

1781
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,380
young female

1782
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,660
do it once

1783
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:18,940
long trip

1784
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,020
So this is what the editor of this magazine said

1785
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,060
Please look at the framed part in the lower left corner

1786
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:27,400
He said that our local article in this issue is called

1787
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,720
Nishigata Diary Middle Small Frame Nishigata Diary

1788
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,540
The author is Chen Fangcheng

1789
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,840
This lady is entertained by our company

1790
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,900
as a lonely woman

1791
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,480
Crossing the East Yellow Sea from the north of Shanghai

1792
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,020
To the three eastern provinces

1793
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,080
It's so far from the Trans-Siberian Railway

1794
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:47,120
And drive

1795
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:48,400
of France

1796
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:49,160
Paris

1797
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:50,960
Long March tens of thousands of miles

1798
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,740
Dozens of days

1799
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,580
Why is his brave and adventurous spirit so vivid?

1800
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,080
middle school grievances

1801
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,860
those who have heard the news

1802
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,460
Cry, Chinese women, come, come together

1803
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:04,780
join this tour

1804
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:09,460
Okay, so who is Chen Fangchen?

1805
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:13,340
Chen Fangchen is the one in the photo

1806
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:15,380
He is Chen Xuezhao

1807
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:20,860
Chen Xuezhao was a quite famous female writer during the May 4th period

1808
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:25,340
Of course she is much younger than this Lu Bicheng

1809
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:29,060
I must also say that no matter in terms of cultural identity

1810
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:31,620
Or political identity

1811
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:35,420
She also took a completely different path from Lu Bicheng.

1812
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:37,180
she is a journalism writer

1813
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:42,300
also a communist

1814
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:47,340
In the end, she should have become a CPPCC member or something.

1815
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:53,100
So her life is very different from that of Lu Bicheng.

1816
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:55,860
Anyway, this travel magazine at the time

1817
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:59,220
would think of sponsoring a woman

1818
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,640
He knew it was a schoolgirl with curly hair

1819
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,300
He's apparently in France

1820
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,800
Then after returning to China

1821
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,800
Accepted the sponsorship of this trip again

1822
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,360
took a rather roundabout one

1823
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,640
a road

1824
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,280
In fact, he could just go straight to

1825
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,720
Just like Lu Bicheng

1826
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,720
Can you just go to France?

1827
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,440
But he has to walk

1828
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,440
run to siberia

1829
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,280
This is definitely a travel agency

1830
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,280
A set itinerary for him

1831
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,600
It is a specially designed itinerary

1832
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:30,160
In order to highlight this journey

1833
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,360
is a feat

1834
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,360
is a long march

1835
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,840
So it's about this woman

1836
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:36,680
alone

1837
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:39,080
Being able to take risks like pan male spirit

1838
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:40,520
Then of course his request

1839
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,880
is a progressive

1840
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,240
independent brave revolutionary women

1841
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,960
then obviously this

1842
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:51,040
Chen Xuezhao represents the brave

1843
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,680
What about the image of a woman?

1844
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,280
Mixiang Yuyi

1845
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,000
with a feather on the head

1846
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,040
wearing tightly embroidered clothes

1847
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,040
Lu Bicheng's

1848
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,600
The image of an oil seller is completely different

1849
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,920
But we can know from this example

1850
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,200
also as a lonely

1851
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,440
woman traveling alone

1852
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:18,280
In fact, Lu Bicheng didn't punish his companions either.

1853
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,880
Chen Xuezhao is a living example

1854
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,880
then indeed like this

1855
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,600
A person is able to board the journey by himself

1856
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,200
Maybe it really is a woman of the twentieth century

1857
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,760
twentieth century women

1858
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,720
A new option when traveling

1859
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:35,800
This is really a woman from the previous generation

1860
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:37,920
no way to enjoy

1861
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,760
Women's Lives in the Late Qing and Early Ming Dynasties

1862
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,640
It actually happened

1863
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,840
many, many new possibilities

1864
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,040
There are so many excellent women

1865
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,400
Lu Bicheng can be said to belong to this generation

1866
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,840
Just one of the great women

1867
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:56,440
But if we talk about travel

1868
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,280
Then their trip to Europe and America

1869
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,000
In fact, his characteristics

1870
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,840
It's not that he's traveled more than others

1871
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,640
go farther than others

1872
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:07,160
Or his Jianwen is more broadcast than others

1873
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:11,240
But I think he especially emphasized

1874
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,720
Neither learning nor adventure

1875
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:17,040
It's the level of roaming

1876
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,000
His travel notes are called European and American Wandering Road

1877
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,600
This trip from 1926

1878
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,920
He doesn't want to be a citizen

1879
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,040
do not want to study

1880
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,800
I don't want to think about saving the country every year

1881
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,200
The few examples we gave earlier

1882
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,040
have a purpose

1883
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,520
But Lu Bicheng's roaming

1884
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,160
roaming

1885
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,120
no purpose

1886
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,120
I think at this level

1887
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,960
he really read a bar

1888
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:49,480
that belonged outside the entire tourism discourse of the time

1889
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:51,920
But maybe that's why

1890
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,640
When we read Lu Bicheng's travel notes today

1891
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:59,680
We also often feel his intention to read Chuang

1892
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:00,760
deodorize

1893
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,580
Then the last period of time, I want to come

1894
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,400
Let me share with you where Lu Bichen is

1895
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:07,940
what is written in the mail

1896
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:09,480
So

1897
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:13,820
Traveling in Europe and America is basically written following his travel footprints

1898
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,900
It started from San Francisco in the west of the United States

1899
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:18,680
then to chicago

1900
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:19,720
then to new york

1901
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:21,500
took a boat across the Atlantic

1902
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,560
to Paris, France

1903
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:25,340
Then take the train

1904
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,620
go to switzerland

1905
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,920
Arrived in Geneva to take over

1906
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:29,940
Huguangshan Temple

1907
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,000
And then to Milan, Italy

1908
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:33,020
Ancient Lawrence

1909
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,040
Rome

1910
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,580
then back to paris

1911
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,400
Then from Paris through Switzerland and Italy

1912
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:40,440
What is this Napoleon?

1913
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:41,720
Pompeii, Venice

1914
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:43,520
In the end it was there

1915
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:44,800
he took the plane

1916
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:46,840
For the first time in his life, he took a plane

1917
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:47,860
Arrived in Australia

1918
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:48,640
vienna

1919
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:50,420
Then take the train

1920
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:51,700
to berlin

1921
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,520
After returning to Paris?

1922
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:55,280
exist

1923
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:56,820
this

1924
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:57,580
cross the sea

1925
01:24:57,780 --> 01:24:58,040
arrive

1926
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,060
go to london

1927
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Then to Paris, then to Switzerland

1928
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Finally settled down in Switzerland

1929
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
So in the beginning he made Paris his center

1930
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
But in the end he chose to settle in Switzerland

1931
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Of course this journey is very complicated

1932
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
But even from our perspective today,

1933
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
We also have to say it's a luxury trip

1934
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
is a dream trip

1935
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
at the beginning of the journey

1936
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
We just said he started in San Francisco

1937
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Well, Journey Bicheng actually described it at the very beginning

1938
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Before he left for Europe from San Francisco

1939
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
he used to visit hollywood

1940
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Whether he writes about Hollywood

1941
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Or he can write about Paris or London later.

1942
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
All revealed his love for the city's prosperity

1943
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
a yearning and nature

1944
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Well, we just mentioned

1945
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
What about America in the 1920s?

1946
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,500
Is the most developed era of the film industry

1947
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:06,000
Then the halo of the star is of course the moment of this holy collection

1948
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
So, Lu Bicheng wants to go to Hollywood for a tour?

1949
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
In fact, it is also a matter of course

1950
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,500
So what happens when he gets to Hollywood?

1951
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:17,000
In particular, he wrote that he went to visit the star's residence

1952
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
He used very, very wonderful early words

1953
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,500
To describe what he sees is not a star

1954
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:27,000
but where the stars live

1955
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,500
But the interesting thing is

1956
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,500
Just like when we read "A Dream of Red Mansions"

1957
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:33,500
we would say that one has one's residence

1958
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,500
Where does Lin Daiyu live?

1959
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:38,500
It must be regarded as the movie of Sensenlong

1960
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:39,500
have pigs

1961
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,000
So what about the place where Xiubao lives?

1962
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,500
Bili Teng Luo

1963
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,500
There is a cold feeling

1964
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,000
So where does Jia Baoyu live?

1965
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,500
it has to be this

1966
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:51,500
There is a daughter's smell, a powdery smell

1967
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,500
Then take Lin Long Baoge and so on

1968
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:54,500
Where do you live?

1969
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,500
Just like this person's temperament, temperament

1970
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,500
Even fate is linked together

1971
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,500
When visiting the homes of Hollywood superstars

1972
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:05,000
He played the reading method of Dream of Red Mansions

1973
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Compare the atmosphere of this superstar's house with the image of this star

1974
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
His status in Hollywood and so on made a link

1975
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:21,000
So let's take an example

1976
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
He seemed to be interested in this at the time

1977
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:29,000
In fact, the Hollywood star who died not long ago

1978
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
It is a special favorite of Panentino's relatives and friends

1979
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Although I think he said with a little false confidence

1980
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Oops, Panentino isn't very good looking.

1981
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Italian men are much prettier than him

1982
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
But in fact he is very interested in Panentino

1983
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Then he specifically mentions

1984
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
When he visited the former residence of Panentino

1985
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
found the atmosphere of this place very heavy

1986
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
vocal range sound forest

1987
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:58,000
No wonder the owner of this house can't live long

1988
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
but he

1989
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,560
He also paid special attention to the original center of the house

1990
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:10,000
There are all kinds of exotic flowers and plants

1991
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:14,000
There is a special flower

1992
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,000
He said there was an unknown

1993
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,760
a strange plant

1994
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:24,160
just be a flower

1995
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,680
Then the color is very, very gorgeous

1996
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:31,080
And this flower is very big

1997
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,800
But because it's too big

1998
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,720
this gold can't hold it

1999
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,840
so it hangs down

2000
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,840
relying on the sidelines

2001
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,640
Then he used a very interesting description to say

2002
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:45,600
The bully of endless flowers

2003
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,840
i think i don't need to say more

2004
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:56,160
Then what he describes is, on the surface, a strange flower

2005
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:58,600
In fact, it is equivalent to

2006
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,240
Handsome, elegant, a symbiosis of Panentino's idol

2007
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,960
or a photo

2008
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,640
A little photo of the heart, a reflection of the heart

2009
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,040
Then, Lu Bichen said

2010
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,880
Then when he sailed across the Atlantic

2011
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:19,000
On the ship, I also dreamed that Panentino came to give him the name of the place.

2012
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:25,440
I think this can really be used as a case for psychoanalysis

2013
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:29,600
Then we might as well take a look with you

2014
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,040
Mulan Ruji in Paris mentioned in the travel notes

2015
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:36,200
What is this place called Mulan Ruji?

2016
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:38,280
can you guess

2017
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:42,920
Mulan Ruji

2018
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,760
Mulan Ruji, Mulan's Nurse

2019
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:51,040
It is the Hongmofang as we know it today.

2020
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:55,480
Well, Lu Bichen described in great detail

2021
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:59,000
The performance he saw in this Red Ink Workshop

2022
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
may wish to read his text

2023
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Well, this is the very early text of the day

2024
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,000
He said that I will not read this long-term relationship

2025
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Basically, feel it

2026
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Just look at the words and condemnation here.

2027
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
He's saying the show is the actors on stage

2028
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
All stars performing

2029
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
There's Mars, there's Venus, there's the moon, whatever.

2030
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Everyone is dressed like a star in the sky

2031
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
very beautiful

2032
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:33,000
His description is of course a kind of shaping is a very strong and disgusting feeling

2033
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
His writing is a performance in itself

2034
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Just like Mulan Ruji's performance on the stage is as exquisite

2035
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
But I think we can also feel

2036
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:48,000
When he wrote in such an early-established classical Chinese

2037
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
very interesting

2038
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:54,000
It’s obviously a western scene, it’s a modern scene

2039
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Written by him in such classical Chinese

2040
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Why do you seem to be eavesdropping

2041
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Has it become the advanced of Chinese classical imagination?

2042
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Do you feel that way?

2043
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Then, Lu Bicheng's writing in classical Chinese

2044
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
An example of transforming Western modernity into Chinese tradition

2045
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
In fact, there are many

2046
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Let's say he writes about what the symbols of Hollywood are

2047
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Is it just the words on the mountain?

2048
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
That word Hollywood

2049
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
But it was like this

2050
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
he described what he saw

2051
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
He said

2052
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
On the one hand, I saw this Cuifeng promoted

2053
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
After solar reflection?

2054
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Yan dwarf overflows like a queen of heaven

2055
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
The fairy came out again

2056
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Then Yu Hui's kindness is a treasure

2057
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Flickering among the clouds and Weng Yi

2058
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
What list?

2059
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
We only know the piano list

2060
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
There is also a list here

2061
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Bangda from the mountainside approx.

2062
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
hollywood

2063
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
He used static

2064
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
To translate the Land of Hollywood Land

2065
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,480
just use this word

2066
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:11,280
Let's take this from a modern movie

2067
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:13,800
this sensuality

2068
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:19,120
Naturally, it is the same as the fairy needle sword in our traditional imagination

2069
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:22,280
A wonderful association arose

2070
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:27,920
Like this kind of tension between the text and the object of description

2071
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:30,240
a relationship that must be worked out

2072
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,920
In Lu Bicheng's this

2073
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:35,920
It can also be seen in the word

2074
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:41,000
This Lu Bicheng wrote a lot of words in his overseas Jianwen

2075
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:47,320
This is also one of the reasons why later people have a high evaluation of his words.

2076
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,720
Because it was impossible for other writers at that time

2077
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,240
like he used such subjects

2078
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,760
Let's look at an example

2079
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,360
This is what he wrote about the Eiffel Tower

2080
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,200
Then I won't read it either

2081
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:58,160
but look at

2082
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
It's really old and new

2083
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Thousands of reds give birth to crows, afraid that the soul of spring will escape

2084
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:15,000
But what about Kyushu first stationed in the sky to inspect

2085
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Iron to Ling Kong

2086
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
He was talking about the buildings of the station at that time

2087
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
This is the benchmark of modern architecture

2088
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
So he is very clever

2089
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:34,000
The kind that combines modern architecture with classical nephrite thermostats

2090
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
imaginatively combined

2091
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Or look at the second

2092
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Do not turn over the old score

2093
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
He took the Eiffel Tower

2094
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,000
It is likened to this standard iron pillar

2095
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
This is the Age of Empires

2096
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,000
The pillar of the national border erected by the Eastern Han Dynasty

2097
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Is a symbol of the empire's industry

2098
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Eiffel Tower

2099
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,600
A symbol of industry compared to the traditional Chinese empire

2100
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:06,800
Stay in Sunny Days with Jin Xian in the Western Regions

2101
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:09,000
almost as high as the sun

2102
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,640
then look down

2103
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:14,000
This car is as small as an ant

2104
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,600
back around

2105
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:19,240
So this lack of words for this blood tyrant from the iron tower

2106
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:23,840
very cleverly put this

2107
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:28,000
In his heart he can never let go

2108
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,600
Chinese classical tradition

2109
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,600
with what he has seen and heard in the West

2110
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,600
make a bond

2111
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:37,200
But always this combination

2112
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:40,600
It seems to me that there is always friction

2113
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:44,400
But this friction also creates some fun

2114
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,800
Then Yubicheng wrote a lot of

2115
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,800
words from overseas

2116
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,600
For example, he wrote about the lake in Geneva

2117
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:55,000
Bingshan writes about the palace and so on.

2118
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,200
So lest it often presents such a similar fun

2119
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,600
When we were reading Lu Bicheng's post

2120
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,120
You will find that as his Lu Cheng advances

2121
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:08,600
He seems to be getting more and more tired of people

2122
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:12,000
Become more and more alienated from human relationships

2123
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,680
Of course, this may be related to his growing religious feelings.

2124
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:22,520
In the end he chose to live by Lake Geneva in Switzerland

2125
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:26,100
Instead of returning to his original Lu-shaped center

2126
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:28,200
Paris metropolitan to permanent residency

2127
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:31,800
I think this residency choice actually reflects

2128
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:34,400
Some changes in his own mood

2129
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,300
But we have to get back to reality

2130
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:41,600
Regardless of whether Lu Bicheng is so rich

2131
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,200
Of course he is very rich to be able to do such a trip

2132
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,200
but whether you have money or not

2133
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:49,200
It doesn't matter it's the 1920s

2134
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,800
Or our 2010s today

2135
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:55,400
To make a person whether a man or a woman

2136
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:58,100
Traveling alone in a foreign country for a long time

2137
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:00,000
Actually it won't be one

2138
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,040
easy is

2139
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,120
then this difficult

2140
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:04,200
this loneliness

2141
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,280
this feeling of loneliness

2142
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:06,040
is a

2143
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:07,480
We lobby for constant

2144
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:08,080
Yes or no

2145
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:10,280
is a time-traveling

2146
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:11,840
Leap across

2147
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:12,480
across

2148
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:13,840
even i want to cross race

2149
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,920
everyone on the go

2150
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,440
there will be a general feeling

2151
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:20,400
I previously

2152
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,160
i forgot what time

2153
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:23,920
But I remember I read a

2154
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,160
read a british book

2155
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,360
book about travel

2156
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,480
in that book

2157
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:32,560
he used several paintings

2158
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:34,000
Well, it just so happened that the painter

2159
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,800
Also one of my favorite painters

2160
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:37,240
let me share with you

2161
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:37,880
good

2162
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:41,040
This is also living in the 1919th century

2163
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,280
Late to 20th century

2164
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:43,520
about age

2165
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,480
left and right one

2166
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:48,080
contemporary british painters

2167
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,920
sorry american painter

2168
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,960
Called Edward Hopper

2169
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:53,360
What about him

2170
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:56,760
My favorite painting is life

2171
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:57,920
maybe i believe

2172
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,520
Everyone has seen his clothes painting

2173
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:00,000
that is

2174
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
On a street is a storefront

2175
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,600
The inside of the store looks very bright

2176
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,800
how many people are sitting inside

2177
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,700
But it seems bright

2178
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:08,200
but you just have a

2179
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:09,500
endless

2180
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:11,200
Empty

2181
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,300
Feelings of consideration

2182
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,200
Then what he expressed

2183
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,700
what about this emotion

2184
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,200
deeply moved me

2185
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:22,800
Then he often draws this kind of

2186
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,900
The feeling of this consideration in the city

2187
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,600
And the feeling of consideration during the trip

2188
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,100
Just now Wang Fu specifically mentioned

2189
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:30,000
travel

2190
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:30,900
train

2191
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:31,900
hotel

2192
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,700
He actually contains all these things

2193
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:36,000
A deep association and charm

2194
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:38,200
It can be expressed in these paintings

2195
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,300
This is the journey he expressed

2196
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:41,100
inside this

2197
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:42,100
lonely

2198
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,200
isolated from others

2199
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,700
feeling of inaccessibility

2200
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:46,300
A sort of

2201
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:47,600
aphasia feeling

2202
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:48,900
you can't talk to people

2203
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:51,200
Or the feeling that there is no language at all

2204
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,800
will be in these paintings

2205
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:54,800
vaguely

2206
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,000
express it

2207
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:57,100
What about these paintings?

2208
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:59,700
Must be from the 1920s

2209
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,120
we can see

2210
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:03,960
Some words are very clear

2211
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:05,960
and it's all a woman

2212
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:08,460
It's clear she's on the road

2213
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:10,760
For example, the upper left corner and the upper right corner follow

2214
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,360
lower right corner

2215
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:13,960
a woman on the go

2216
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:14,960
What about the lower left corner?

2217
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,460
she didn't tell you she was traveling

2218
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:18,460
But what?

2219
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:19,200
do not know why

2220
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,540
I just feel like she's traveling

2221
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:23,040
She is at a rest stop on a trip

2222
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,040
a resting place in the middle

2223
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,040
no one to talk to

2224
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,160
Kuji

2225
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,200
cold

2226
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:30,200
We can see that

2227
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:31,200
she

2228
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,200
to get a coffee cup

2229
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:35,200
That's why I took off my gloves

2230
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,200
but what about the other hand

2231
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,200
Some people carry such heavy

2232
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:40,200
a glove

2233
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,200
She can't even take off her hat and clothes

2234
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:43,200
so cold so empty

2235
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:44,200
so guji

2236
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,200
a feeling

2237
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,200
then every time you see

2238
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,200
this

2239
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:52,200
Hopperized these

2240
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,200
What about female tourists?

2241
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:56,200
Actually reminds me of 1920

2242
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:58,240
Tourist City Roaming in Europe and America

2243
01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:59,240
yes

2244
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,080
Li Bicheng also often wrote in his travel notes

2245
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:06,200
He will come into contact with different people during this trip

2246
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:07,800
For example, the person who sold him the ticket

2247
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:09,800
Or a passenger in the same car

2248
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:12,400
He also quarrels with passengers in the same car

2249
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:17,600
Or a strange teenager who went with him to swim Lake Geneva

2250
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:19,800
Wait, he's in contact with people

2251
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:23,400
But what about that feeling of loneliness and emptiness?

2252
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:26,600
but never seemed to leave him

2253
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,600
And what's interesting

2254
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:31,200
What about his sense of isolation and ordering?

2255
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:34,800
He often expresses it in a negative way

2256
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,800
For example, he would specifically write

2257
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:37,800
Um

2258
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:40,600
When he travels, he often laughs at himself

2259
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:44,000
He'll say he's always smiling

2260
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Why because only one person doesn't smile so what

2261
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,600
Well, the helplessness he showed

2262
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,400
ah one feels good

2263
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:53,600
or is it

2264
01:39:53,600 --> 01:40:00,000
He used a certain method to create a particularly deserted

2265
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,280
or a particularly lively scene

2266
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:06,200
But whether it's deserted or lively

2267
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:09,080
Lu Bicheng's figure as a lonely woman

2268
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:10,560
will be more prominent

2269
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,960
Let's look at two examples

2270
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,400
This is the first example

2271
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,560
One time she was stuck in London

2272
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,240
It's been half a year

2273
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:20,760
she hates london

2274
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:21,680
Why

2275
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:22,920
It is clear

2276
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:24,960
At that time, the air pollution in London was very serious.

2277
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,040
Plus London is already foggy

2278
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:29,320
When she was there, it was winter

2279
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,320
She is not used to the food

2280
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:35,920
How about going to this Japanese restaurant in the alley next door for tofu?

2281
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:37,320
counting money piece by piece

2282
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:40,320
she can't stand it

2283
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:43,320
How to do it

2284
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:44,320
she says

2285
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:48,320
Encounter, count the days, she knows this is

2286
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,320
Lunar cooking department

2287
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,320
in China

2288
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:54,320
Her relatives and friends should be celebrating

2289
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:55,320
at reunion

2290
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:57,320
She is a solo artist

2291
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:58,320
So what about Lu Bicheng?

2292
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:00,320
she says

2293
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
This is New Year's Eve

2294
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,000
So I dress myself up beautifully

2295
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I walked alone to the hotel's special restaurant to eat

2296
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
what does he describe himself in

2297
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,000
He is wearing a black section Hiratzu Hiratzu is a method of embroidery

2298
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:21,000
This wrist coat embroidered with He, He, what a lonely image

2299
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
The black segment is embroidered with golden hex

2300
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
in golden shoes and bead jars

2301
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
He likes to wear pearls in a bead jar

2302
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
He said it is very cheap to buy pearls in China

2303
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
wearing a bead jar

2304
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:41,000
like a fairy like a celestial being also like this image

2305
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Go to the hotel's special restaurant

2306
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:47,000
He said I look like I'm a fool

2307
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,000
That is to say, Hu Tianhudi means to look like a man in heaven

2308
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,000
It's not what people in the world mean

2309
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Consider what he has built for himself

2310
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Such a deserted and lonely image

2311
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,600
image or vice versa at the busiest moment

2312
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:10,000
This is that he has finally arrived in Switzerland.

2313
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:14,000
so he's there and he's just that rich

2314
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,300
He lives by the lake in Geneva

2315
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:22,600
But he said that because of meeting Jieqing, the rest of the night

2316
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:26,500
It's all from Guyue Xuantian, he can't do anything, he can't sleep at all

2317
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:31,800
So he felt that he was too lonely

2318
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:37,400
Because when you're alone, you're in this busy place where you're bothered

2319
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:42,200
You will feel more sick, not to mention he is not worried about poverty

2320
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:46,000
As for why he puts his worries on poverty, of course, that's another matter.

2321
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
So it’s okay to pretend you can’t hear me, what should I do in the end?

2322
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,600
He just decided to say, then I'll join them.

2323
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:56,200
So which issue of his costume did he pay so much attention to his image?

2324
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:58,900
I still have to dress up, dress up before going out

2325
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:00,200
then just

2326
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,160
just go outside for a walk

2327
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:04,200
found outside

2328
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:06,200
From people like branches, lanterns and bamboo sky

2329
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:09,800
Red and green rubber halo on the lake surface, pearls of water blooming

2330
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:11,800
Unique banquet

2331
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:13,000
at this time

2332
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,600
This is Baihuahui

2333
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:15,400
this festival

2334
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:17,400
All of them are holding a paper bag inside

2335
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:18,400
All tax-deductible materials

2336
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:19,800
lose when you see someone

2337
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,600
Seems like they're not splashing water

2338
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,400
They are just splash material

2339
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,000
So

2340
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Even the body of the police will be thrown away is the material

2341
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
that law does not prohibit

2342
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,200
So

2343
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:32,000
what did he say

2344
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,200
what about this time

2345
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:35,000
Both father and daughter are wearing bags

2346
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,400
And the collars are big

2347
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:37,400
so

2348
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:39,000
Once the material is thrown away?

2349
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
They all ran into the clothes

2350
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:42,600
So

2351
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:45,200
Some people will pull this collar off of others

2352
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:45,600
Then what

2353
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,200
Pour all the materials in

2354
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:48,900
So

2355
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:51,200
Someone deliberately patted someone on the shoulder

2356
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:53,000
As soon as you look back, quickly put this material

2357
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,800
Throw it in someone's face, etc.

2358
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,600
this prank goes

2359
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:58,800
Then he was thrown out

2360
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,000
made him that this

2361
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,200
I can't keep my eyes open

2362
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:03,440
It's like he's at war

2363
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:04,320
he lost

2364
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:05,560
he fled back to the hotel

2365
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:06,440
he said it doesn't matter

2366
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,080
i'm ready tomorrow

2367
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:08,840
again

2368
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:11,720
So the next day he took the weapon himself

2369
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:13,520
Just a bag of material

2370
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:17,720
Then there's a towel over it

2371
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:19,400
pretend you don't have a weapon

2372
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:21,160
wait until someone walks in

2373
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:25,200
It was only then that I suddenly threw this material on someone else.

2374
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:29,280
Then he is particularly visual

2375
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:34,600
To describe how he participated in the Hundred Flowers Festival

2376
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:38,520
How do you hang out with everyone?

2377
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:46,080
we can really imagine

2378
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:49,360
The hotel where I was alone in London

2379
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:54,160
But also stubbornly wear beaded gold and aluminum

2380
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:56,760
This must-see city in the lake, sky and lake

2381
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:58,520
Arrived at the Hundred Flowers Festival

2382
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:00,080
but he wants to let go

2383
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,680
chasing after the crowd like a child

2384
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:06,800
Passionate about planting this material

2385
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:10,520
In fact, the loneliness of that journey

2386
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:13,120
It's not bothering me at all

2387
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:15,880
Or lighten up with laughing scenes

2388
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:18,200
Instead, we see more

2389
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:20,960
the sorrow in his heart

2390
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,920
The loneliness of the figure

2391
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:26,120
Against the backdrop of this external joyful environment

2392
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:29,440
In fact, it is more prominent

2393
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,400
The interesting thing is that Lu Bicheng said

2394
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:35,680
This Hundred Flowers War is actually an elegant battle

2395
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:36,880
everyone is silent

2396
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,880
Because all the people here are international

2397
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:40,440
We don't speak the same language

2398
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:42,160
So it's right to throw away the paper if you borrow it.

2399
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:43,760
no need to speak

2400
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:46,320
so you can also say

2401
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:47,920
For Lu Bicheng

2402
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:52,640
This is the most convenient way to integrate into a foreign country

2403
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,480
Because you just open yourself up

2404
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:57,200
You don't need to be able to communicate in language

2405
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:59,400
can be integrated into the environment

2406
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:04,280
At the end of the Hundred Flowers Conference

2407
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:07,480
Lu Bicheng also made it very clear

2408
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:09,480
He said that night

2409
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:13,200
like a dream

2410
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,440
After all, his life experience is in vain

2411
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,040
identity of his culture

2412
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,720
His love on this journey

2413
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:21,880
His self-admiration and so on

2414
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:26,160
They can only temporarily participate in such a Hundred Flowers Conference

2415
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:27,680
just be liberated

2416
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:30,280
What about after the big dream trip?

2417
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:34,520
He is still going back to the home of the wandering lonely traveler

2418
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:38,320
in this situation

2419
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:40,840
Of course it's in his mail

2420
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:43,080
Also mentioned a lot of this more practical issue

2421
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:45,440
For example, how can I get into trouble booking a ticket?

2422
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:46,960
sometimes dangerous

2423
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,040
In fact, traveling alone

2424
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:50,800
Of course it can be dangerous

2425
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,440
Then Lu Bicheng is in the post office

2426
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:57,080
Keep mentioning that he's actually in constant danger

2427
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:59,800
Unknowingly or luckily escaped

2428
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Here's another story lurking out there

2429
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Of course I don't have time to share with you today

2430
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:14,000
The highest point of Lu Bicheng's mailing

2431
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
It should be when he was in 1929

2432
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Accepted the invitation of the World Animal Protection Association

2433
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,000
to vienna for the congress

2434
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:28,000
At this time Lu Bicheng is a very devout Buddhist

2435
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,000
He sang that vegetarian food does not kill

2436
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:38,000
But he attended the conference as a

2437
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
and the public speaking guests

2438
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,000
We still see this image

2439
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:49,000
The person is the one who wears pearls, steps on golden shoes, and eyebrow pencil

2440
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:55,000
The image of Lu Bicheng dressed like a peacock

2441
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:00,000
So he will always insist on literary creation

2442
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,200
Writing classical Chinese and old poems

2443
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,600
seems to be i independent

2444
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:07,700
He will always write in an old style

2445
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:11,400
So it is often classified as a conservative in literature

2446
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:12,600
or old hands

2447
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:15,400
Well, on the surface

2448
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:19,600
He is this maverick in terms of behavior

2449
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:24,800
Then his behavior and his insistence on style

2450
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:28,000
It seems that if we just said at the beginning

2451
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:31,300
Looks like it's been stolen or contradicted

2452
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:34,700
But in fact, we might as well think about it the other way around

2453
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:38,700
When he stands in such a mighty modern

2454
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:41,300
when inside the red oil of the times

2455
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:42,300
does he want it

2456
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:44,600
just indifferent

2457
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:46,000
but he is not

2458
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:46,900
so what

2459
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:49,900
He is like Lu Bicheng

2460
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:52,800
there is such a non-inquiry

2461
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:54,900
a rebellious personality

2462
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:57,000
Only in such a powerful

2463
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,100
Stick to a certain kind of trend in an era

2464
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
what he believes

2465
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
then finally

2466
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
as a conclusion

2467
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
get out of the house

2468
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Travel from abroad

2469
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
life journey

2470
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
literary travel

2471
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
China travel experience

2472
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
In fact, there are various

2473
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
face

2474
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
My speech today is just to choose

2475
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Lu Bicheng's European and American Tours

2476
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
as the center

2477
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Of course this is because

2478
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
character who goes by himself

2479
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Also because of his works to this day

2480
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
let us appreciate

2481
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
complete place

2482
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
And more noticeably

2483
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
active in the 19th century

2484
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
turn of the second century

2485
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
women of literature

2486
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Lu Bicheng, I think

2487
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
really has some kind of key meaning

2488
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
he obviously

2489
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
cant

2490
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
simply to inspire

2491
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
progress

2492
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
We are more simplistic today

2493
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
label to define him

2494
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
why

2495
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,240
Because from some of the examples we just climbed

2496
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:06,240
you can see

2497
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:09,920
It actually continues upwards

2498
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:12,920
The literary aesthetics of classical women

2499
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:16,520
And a heart and will to explore outward

2500
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:20,960
Down it actually opened the modern

2501
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:24,600
We can even say that it means contemporary

2502
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:27,880
Roaming New Meaning of Travel

2503
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:33,920
The travels it does and the writing it mails

2504
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:38,000
the kind of many women of its generation

2505
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,200
purposeful travel

2506
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:43,160
In fact, there is a separation

2507
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:46,280
I want to use a special example today

2508
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:49,880
Back and forth to the Ming and Qing Dynasties

2509
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:52,080
and down to our contemporary experience

2510
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:53,320
Share it with everyone

2511
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:57,240
My observations and understanding of Chinese women's travel experience

2512
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,280
with feelings

2513
01:50:58,280 --> 01:50:59,280
Thanks

2514
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Thank you for talking nonsense

2515
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
then he speaks brilliantly

2516
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
we have about ten minutes

2517
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
I don't know who's going to finish

2518
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
good time

2519
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Simple

2520
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
short

2521
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
if there is a problem, just say

2522
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
just said it again and again

2523
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
he is classified as handy

2524
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
because of his problem

2525
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
But his hands are so-called, they are actually too attractive

2526
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Those who criticized him at the time

2527
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
rebellious for his attraction

2528
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
he doesn't want to start hurtful behavior

2529
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Don't you think your criticism is contradictory?

2530
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
What do these critics think of

2531
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
His behavior attracts hands with his questions

2532
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
so this thing

2533
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Thanks

2534
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
What I just said is actually a

2535
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
The name of the later construction

2536
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
His contemporaries don't think so

2537
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
For example he was

2538
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Posted in so many news

2539
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
What was in the media at the time

2540
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
It's what I just said is very popular.

2541
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
So we'll see in hindsight

2542
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
When we went to see him in later literary history

2543
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
will be like this

2544
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
He would be classified as such

2545
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
what old hands

2546
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Or can't innovate

2547
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Or let's say what we see in contemporary times

2548
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
a modern critic would say

2549
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
in his overseas neologisms

2550
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Although I have written so many Western things

2551
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
but just one

2552
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
he never left

2553
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
his Chinese classical

2554
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
we will see criticism like this

2555
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
with his western sword

2556
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
the spark

2557
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
that's where it gets interesting

2558
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
It’s not that he must give up Chinese classical

2559
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Or he must embrace the western Jianwen

2560
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
that genre follows

2561
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
The one produced between his sword texts

2562
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
The contradiction is

2563
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
is where he's really interesting

2564
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
personally

2565
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
ask for advice

2566
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Just mentioned that Li Bichen

2567
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
he

2568
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
before going to san francisco

2569
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
used to visit

2570
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
he went to san francisco first

2571
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
not go first

2572
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
San Francisco

2573
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
then to

2574
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
His name is Luo Sheng

2575
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Rosander

2576
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
then go to hollywood

2577
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
going to hollywood

2578
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Said he was dreaming

2579
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Go to Nan Xingxing's business card and give him

2580
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Li Bichen

2581
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Did he ever yearn for

2582
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
maybe

2583
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
gonna be a hollywood star

2584
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Is there such a record

2585
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Thanks

2586
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Is there such a record?

2587
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I don't seem to have seen such a record

2588
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
But he's really a star

2589
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
except he's not hollywood

2590
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
quiet star

2591
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Thank you very much for your thoughts

2592
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Today you presented this

2593
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
trip

2594
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,000
But we also know that in the late 19th or early 20th century

2595
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,000
There are many Chinese laborers going to Southeast Asia or to Europe and the United States

2596
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Then they are an underground class

2597
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Then it was also during this period that women began to

2598
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:19,000
It may be because the male goes out first to follow the son or the husband.

2599
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,000
And to the United States or to Southeast Asia

2600
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
that their trip

2601
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:27,000
If we take their outings as travel

2602
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,000
their travel experience will be very different

2603
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I don’t know if it’s in your research

2604
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Is there any travel involved in this area?

2605
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
is underground

2606
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,000
This alarm is easy to guess

2607
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
sore feet because

2608
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
because i'm from doing this star feminist literature

2609
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Or until the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Ming Dynasty

2610
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:54,000
The phenomenon of some so-called female writers in the literary world

2611
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:00,000
I must admit I'm really relatively untouched by this upper middle class

2612
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Beyond the experience of women's lives

2613
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,000
The one I'm sharing with you today

2614
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
content

2615
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
at most it is about

2616
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Activities in Jingxiang

2617
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Participated by non-elite women

2618
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
But I must also regret to say

2619
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Just that example

2620
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
also by male authors

2621
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
presented with a critical eye

2622
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
So as for women of that class

2623
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
when she engages in activities like that

2624
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
her own

2625
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
no matter how

2626
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
I feel good

2627
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
She has good experience

2628
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
I

2629
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
I haven't done any research myself

2630
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,000
then i too

2631
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,000
I have no idea

2632
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
what material to use

2633
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
can come to explore

2634
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
this aspect of this matter

2635
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
this is real

2636
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
beyond my ability

2637
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
terribly sorry

2638
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Thanks

2639
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:08,600
Thank you, I’m the author and I can’t understand it, but it’s very interesting to listen to tonight

2640
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:12,960
One problem I have is that your head is all purple

2641
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:16,800
Your clothes are also purple, so it doesn't matter if I carry them

2642
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:25,700
In fact, if my colleagues know that the background color of the POWER POINT I use recently is this color

2643
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:29,500
Because I think it has a dark background, so it highlights the front

2644
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:32,700
That's the only reason the dress was just casually worn this morning when it was too late

2645
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:34,900
just a coincidence

2646
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:45,500
I think just now Director Hu showed the rich clothing images of women since the Ming and Qing Dynasties

2647
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:50,900
travel is a big subject i'm not researching this but travel is a big subject

2648
01:56:50,900 --> 01:56:56,000
In 1932 or the 1930s, Academia Sinica had an early

2649
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,200
But he really seemed to be just an editor named Jiang Shaoyuan who wrote an article

2650
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Ancient Chinese Travel Studies

2651
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Look inside and talk about ancient travel

2652
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
full of superstition

2653
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
use many mysterious means

2654
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:12,000
To prevent bad luck from happening, etc.

2655
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
So the whole trip is a

2656
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
A very complicated and dangerous process

2657
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,000
But this book pays little attention to

2658
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
But there are many books like this

2659
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:28,000
It is also worth referring to our elves today

2660
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,000
When painstaking efforts of Haruki are always fashionable

2661
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Travel is an important means for their spiritual progress

2662
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Because you have to meet different people when you go out

2663
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
different realms

2664
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
so travel

2665
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,000
But it's different from what he said today

2666
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Nonsense Zhang is talking about another stage

2667
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Another form of this trip

2668
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I think he spoke very well today

2669
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I've been watching what he's looking at paper

2670
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I thought there was an article

2671
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
because he speaks well

2672
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,800
He noticed that the birth of a child is a chapter of this

2673
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:05,800
Later I found out that there is no, he actually seems to be an article, right?

2674
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:08,800
is relevant

2675
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:10,800
related

2676
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:12,800
related related material

2677
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,800
Li Bicheng of course

2678
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:17,800
I'm only here and there are a lot of things about him.

2679
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:20,800
Frankly speaking, I always thought he was with

2680
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:22,800
People like Hu Yingmeng

2681
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:24,800
Do you know Hu Yingmeng?

2682
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:28,800
He and many important people in the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China

2683
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:32,800
They all had contacts, and the earliest was with the most famous

2684
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:35,800
The latest sciences together, like logic, etc.

2685
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:37,800
So there are many in the original father who are related to Li Bicheng

2686
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:40,800
Many people had two burns. The original father and others mentioned it.

2687
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:43,800
But this Uncle Hu showed another name today.

2688
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:47,800
I knew very little about this side

2689
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:50,800
It's because I listened to his speech today.

2690
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:52,800
I'm very proud of myself, too. Thank you.

2691
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:55,800
Well we just missed you today thank you

2692
01:58:58,800 --> 01:58:59,800
Thanks
