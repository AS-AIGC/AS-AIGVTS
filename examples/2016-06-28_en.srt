1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
music

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
music

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
music

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
music

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
music

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
applause

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
music

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,240
So today we actually have two keynote speakers

9
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,040
but

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,300
Ah, academician Zhang Shenghua, he is very polite

11
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:07,680
he

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,840
Ah, a self-proclaimed shadow speaker

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,480
He will speak for 20 minutes

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,800
So

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,280
So the speaker is Li Guangdi

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,440
Teacher, the two of them performed together

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,440
Joint performance

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,140
What about today's keynote speaker, Dr. Li Guangdi?

19
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,740
Is a researcher at the Institute of History, Academia Sinica

20
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,140
then arizona state university

21
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,340
PhD in Archaeological Anthropology

22
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,980
He's mostly doing ecological archaeology

23
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,580
that is, through archaeological remains

24
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,180
to estimate

25
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,240
recovery

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,740
Then the food resources at that time

27
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,040
Ecological environment and climate

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,880
including the population

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,280
Including the time the site was occupied, etc.

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,980
So this is a highly integrated technology

31
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,280
imagination

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,580
one of archaeological work and more

33
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,440
Your knowledge is very important

34
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,540
his main

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Except for the Academia Sinica

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,600
He is also in the School of Anthropology of Tsing University

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,400
That is to say, the Earth Science Department of Normal University

38
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,400
and Tainan University of the Arts

39
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,200
first lesson

40
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,600
Then his main scope of work

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,800
is in

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,000
Hengchun Peninsula

43
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,700
and Tainan Science Park

44
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,100
I can testify that he is almost

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,600
Ah, a representative of public opinion

46
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,900
I remember twenty, thirty or twenty years ago

47
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,400
when i went there once

48
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,900
He knows almost everyone there

49
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,800
everyone around

50
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,200
so i know he's over there

51
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,500
deep plowing

52
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,600
There is quite a deep

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,800
local strength

54
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,800
Today's shadow speaker is Academician Zhang Zhenghua

55
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,400
Well, he's also a research fellow at the History Institute of the Majestic Academy.

56
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,800
He is a Ph.D. from Harvard University

57
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,900
His main research interest is Taiwan

58
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,200
Southeast Asia

59
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,700
and this archaeological site in South China

60
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,700
Research

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,800
He was in 2002 to 2006

62
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,100
secondment single

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,660
Director of National Taiwan Museum of Prehistory

64
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,860
Chang Hsien is of course the current archaeological leader in Taiwan

65
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,220
Three of the many jobs he now performs

66
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,120
One is the archaeology of Nanke

67
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,860
One is the archeology of Baxian Cave

68
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,960
that is a very important site

69
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,320
One is to lead the underwater archeology team of Academia Sinica

70
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:27,100
He was elected as an academician of Academia Sinica on the Third World in 2014

71
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,820
The topic the two of them are going to talk about today is Nanke Archeology

72
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,420
5000 years of discovery of Taiwan

73
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,620
You may have noticed that Nanke Archeology has been going on for 20 years

74
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,360
Voted one of the top ten archaeological sites in the world last year

75
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,520
Then I just noticed

76
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,160
This is the first time that Nanke archeology has been included in the knowledge award test report

77
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,660
Their work I think this opportunity is very rare

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,600
Then this archaeological site

79
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,620
Worked without knowledge for 20 years

80
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,620
said

81
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
touched area

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
2000 hectares of independent

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
A total of 70 archaeological sites were discovered

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Large-scale excavations were carried out at 34 of them

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The total excavated area reached more than 120,000 average meters

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
More than 120,000 square meters

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The abundance of archaeological materials unearthed

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
all kinds of colors

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Because he used to be the director of this institute

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So I also visited

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
very rich

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm afraid it's Asia, I dare not talk nonsense

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
One of the largest archaeological sites

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Whether it is naughty, stone, jade, bone, etc.

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Taiwan's first dog

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Taiwan's first

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
all from this ruins

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
There are more than 2,000 unearthed

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
More than 2000 dramas

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
spanned over 5000 years

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
rare archaeological site

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
As the climate of the South Island and foot of the world

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,500
It is very important to migrate

104
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,500
It is very important to understand this issue

105
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Well, this archaeological team is currently conducting

106
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,000
Arrangement and analysis of cultural relics unearthed in one place in twenty one places

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,500
Sorting and analysis, wow, are two different things again.

108
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Archeology sucks.

109
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,500
And it's very hard, working with the soil all day long

110
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
It's really hard work

111
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,500
After that, it needs to be analyzed and sorted out.

112
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
Still need to organize and analyze

113
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,000
Also do DNA testing

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Gotta do all kinds of this wow amazing amazing

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Then this site enriches the new era of Taiwan

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Understanding of Early Human Lifestyles

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Also provides more information about the ancient Austronesian peoples

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
New Evidence and Understanding of Ocean-to-Ocean Diffusion from the Asian Continent

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Of course, this site is because of the huge size of Thailand

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I can't introduce them all here

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Should we just welcome Academician Zhang Zhenghua to do camp performances first?

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Thanks

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,600
Thank you, Dean Wang, for letting me come here to give an introduction.

124
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,200
Thank you very much too

125
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,400
be honest

126
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,200
Come and listen to our Nanke archaeological report

127
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,500
I think today this archaeological

128
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,900
This knowledge feast of the past

129
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,100
I've said it twice

130
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,500
So this time I would like to invite our colleagues

131
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,400
Mr. Li Huangqing will talk about it

132
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,100
Later, our dean helped me to return the ticket.

133
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,900
Say no, the two of you

134
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,200
So finally we assign

135
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,700
I said I'll be the intro

136
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,500
Or ask our colleagues to do this

137
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,200
a major report

138
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,100
So what I'm going to talk about today is

139
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,000
I just want to make this Nanke archaeological

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,800
ins and outs

141
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,900
can give a little introduction

142
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,300
Everyone can have an impression

143
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,400
Then the following enters our topic

144
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,500
How Nanke Archeology Discovered Taiwan for 5,000 Years

145
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,200
And how to discover the five thousand years of Taiwan

146
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,100
this is the topic of today's speech

147
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,100
then this

148
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,300
I think the reason why

149
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
The vice president will take a fancy to us

150
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
let us come

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,880
come here to sing the play

152
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,380
Basically these two brands

153
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,080
Because in December last year we participated in a

154
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,540
This is an archeology of a world

155
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,300
this is in shanghai

156
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,740
One held in Shanghai in 2015

157
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,140
The World Archaeological Forum

158
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,700
Then we propose this project

159
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,640
A Description of Our One Contents

160
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,080
then by this

161
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,340
Selected as the so-called top ten archaeological discoveries in the world

162
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,340
The first is field archaeological discoveries

163
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,840
so we get two medals

164
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
I was a little disappointed when I got it

165
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,640
looks heavy

166
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Later, I found out that it was probably signed inside.

167
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,840
Du layer of gold on the outside

168
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,240
If two gold medals

169
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,040
That's pretty worth it

170
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,140
but it will

171
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,740
This is what we do for the Central Court

172
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,740
You can also fight for a little glory

173
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,540
because this is about

174
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,740
There are 40 top scholars and experts in the world

175
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,440
jointly reviewed

176
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,240
and then to grant

177
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,940
So we also feel honored

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
to get such an award

179
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,000
then this is

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,300
So today I probably want to basically explain the ins and outs of this plan.

181
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,200
First of all, let me give you a report

182
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,500
I think our basic archeology is the study of history

183
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,100
What about our special Taiwan archeology in Taiwan

184
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,600
Basically, it is necessary to study and study the history of Taiwan.

185
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,100
But what about Taiwan's history?

186
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,700
written history is very short

187
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,000
Everyone knows about 300 to 400 years

188
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
very short

189
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,500
So we all know this

190
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,200
In fact, what is the history of our people in Taiwan?

191
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,200
It's definitely not 300 or 400 years now

192
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,300
Now at least according to our current archaeological data

193
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,300
Just now the vice president of the academy mentioned that I am personally in Baixuandong

194
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,700
This research has been done for several years

195
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,500
So now it's almost certain

196
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,000
The history of human habitation in Taiwan is now 30,000 years

197
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
At least 30,000 years at the latest

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,300
those 30,000 years

199
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,200
Then let's make a comparison of Taiwan's history

200
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,000
Then he only accounts for the written history of Taiwan?

201
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,560
Only 1.3% of Taiwan's human history

202
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,600
So a little bit of the rest of the time is without text

203
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,920
don't know

204
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,880
unknown in the past

205
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,680
Later, archaeological data showed him

206
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,280
If viewed on a mid-plane

207
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,400
Written History Accounts for Taiwan History

208
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,880
only 48 seconds

209
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,200
Other such a big circle

210
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,960
basically no text

211
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,520
so what if there is no text

212
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,960
must rely on archeology

213
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
So the vice president of archeology just mentioned

214
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,280
archeology is hard

215
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,200
to go to the fields to do cutting and digging

216
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,640
Come back to organize, analyze, research

217
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,800
The purpose is to reconstruct the history of Taiwan

218
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,080
Especially 99.0% of Taiwan

219
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,120
This history needs to be borrowed from archeology

220
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,960
information searched evidence searched

221
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,520
Then come and help us rebuild

222
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,000
In addition, archaeological data

223
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,920
Most of them are sold underground

224
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,560
say to dig, to dig

225
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,760
do fieldwork

226
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,720
also in the water

227
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,800
submerged in water

228
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,360
So we inside the Taiwan Strait

229
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,000
there are many flooded

230
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,440
or silent these ancients

231
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,560
transplant or transplant

232
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,720
Well, this aspect actually needs to rely on Gu Xue's research.

233
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,320
So the vice president mentioned it just now. I personally also presided over an underwater valley team of our hospital recently.

234
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
So the purpose is around Taiwan

235
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,360
Especially the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea

236
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,760
To do this underwater survey of these valleys

237
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, this is so relying on the Gu family to go to the field to find information

238
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,200
So a lot of envy depends on the Gu family

239
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
often travel outside

240
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Take a tour of the mountains and rivers, what about me personally?

241
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
I don't know how to climb a mountain above the sea

242
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,600
It's all good, in fact, he doesn't know all kinds of hard work.

243
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
You only know if you have a bag

244
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,600
In addition, going to the sea is the same as going to Mizuno to investigate.

245
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,000
So, therefore, whether these things are in the water

246
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,400
Or a space on land that can store these valley-based data?

247
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
basically become a size

248
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
It's just a transplant

249
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
And what about these transplants, of course

250
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,200
We must rely on the research and analysis of Gu Xue

251
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
What about after analyzing this research?

252
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,240
Only then can we make the incompleteness of human history

253
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,960
complement it

254
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,600
So Taiwan is facing 99.9% of Taiwan's history

255
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,120
archaeological data

256
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,280
the study of archaeology

257
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,600
to supplement

258
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,360
to enrich

259
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,840
So therefore the archaeological site

260
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,960
It is a very important asset of a culture

261
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,720
if you say don't pay attention to it

262
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,960
that would easily destroy it

263
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,800
so like this

264
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,720
Our current construction in various aspects in Taiwan

265
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,920
In fact, the ruins are constantly being destroyed.

266
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,680
very many ruins

267
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,720
This is a No. 13 ruins that I rescued in the past

268
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,200
almost gone now

269
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,400
most are gone

270
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,120
Like many ruins in Taiwan

271
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
Just like that, it was dug up by strange hands.

272
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,000
once dug out

273
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,800
You can't rely on this anymore

274
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,960
Let's recreate our past human history

275
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,000
Of course now slowly

276
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,880
our government

277
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,800
our people

278
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,600
also slowly understand

279
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,840
These ruins should be protected

280
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,080
Now there are many means of protection

281
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,440
The first is through the law

282
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,920
Now currently we have a

283
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,000
Cultural Assets Preservation Act

284
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,380
This law will require all engineering construction

285
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,040
in the development process

286
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,160
or development must be done before

287
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,240
Always investigate and evaluate

288
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,660
Then if it damages the chair

289
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,160
so you have to go and that's it

290
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,540
This project of yours needs to be adjusted

291
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,340
or how to protect these chairs

292
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,760
The other is the Environmental Impact Assessment Act

293
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
This law also clearly stipulates

294
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,080
all because of development

295
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,840
adverse impact on the environment

296
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,720
environmental impact assessment

297
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,220
This assessment also includes cultural and educational

298
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,420
or cultural facilities

299
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,920
or chair of culture

300
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,420
In this way, if the development

301
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,320
we can avoid

302
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,920
Destroy these chairs for development

303
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,220
So therefore this archaeologist recently

304
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,760
We especially know Taiwan's

305
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,800
In fact, there are not many people

306
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,220
We are a very small group

307
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,300
But we've taken on a pretty big job

308
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,080
Various developments in Taiwan now

309
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,120
In fact, a lot of things have to be done

310
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,400
do archaeological research

311
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,800
Do an archaeological assessment

312
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,600
like this one

313
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
So many people joked that we said

314
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,000
Archaeologists in Taiwan are the fire brigade

315
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Why did the firefighters accuse the police of going to the fire?

316
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,800
Firefighting is not firefighting

317
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,800
is to rescue or protect these ruins

318
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,000
then in general

319
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,200
There are several ways to protect the site of this archaeological team

320
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,800
The first one is that I just ask it to stop development

321
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,200
If the road or railway is going to pass by

322
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,000
sorry

323
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,400
this site is very important

324
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
very valuable

325
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,200
then you have to change your course

326
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Change the way you build

327
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
The second is to change the development content

328
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,400
That is to say, if this highway

329
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,600
to pass through this site

330
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,800
And this site is a very valuable site

331
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,000
after you remove it

332
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,400
will have an impact on our entire history

333
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
I'm sorry

334
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,800
then you're going to change your

335
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,200
But the project cannot be changed

336
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,400
Building highways like Taiwan is difficult

337
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,000
It's actually very difficult for you to make it change course

338
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,200
not only about economics

339
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,800
issues related to politics

340
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,200
So this time I will ask

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,320
You change the development content

342
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,720
just change a way

343
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,280
If this company can use high-priced bridge currency

344
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,800
Do not destroy this site

345
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,160
these can look like this

346
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,760
or one place one factory

347
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,360
I let you change its position

348
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,760
keep it here

349
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,640
as a green space

350
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,000
or for the park

351
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,160
Then the third is finally no way

352
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,800
Going to rescue and excavate

353
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,600
Connotation of unearthed sites

354
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,560
to record

355
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,440
to be unearthed

356
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,840
this is a last resort

357
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,520
Well like we are in Tainan Science Park

358
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,760
Today it is mainly called Nanke Archeology

359
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,720
Mainly refers to Tainan Science Park

360
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,480
Then this Tainan Branch

361
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,600
we go

362
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,280
The Nanke archaeological team of our aid institute

363
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,080
we are in the joint camp

364
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,240
15 years of field work

365
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,280
Every year is the soil of Seoul

366
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,680
struggle there

367
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,480
then this part

368
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,000
This is our picture

369
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,840
It's from Nanke

370
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,160
Currently we are in Nanke

371
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,760
a large number of ruins were found

372
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,960
In fact, the source of this work

373
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,080
It's actually a very coincidental

374
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,680
this accident

375
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,240
Because this was in the 81st year of the Republic of China

376
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,480
Executive Yuan

377
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,440
It is to balance domestic

378
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,040
technological development

379
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So it was decided to build a second science park in Tainan

380
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The first one is Hsinchu Science Park

381
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
the second is in the south

382
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Then choose its position at this time

383
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Finally, the county in Tainan was selected.

384
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Tainan County

385
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This Shanhua New City

386
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And this place in the middle of the three townships of Anding

387
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This place was originally a farm in Taitang.

388
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We know that many developments in Taiwan

389
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
In the end, the land was found in Taitang

390
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Taitang is a big landlord

391
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So here is a big farm of Zhenong in Taitang

392
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So I chose this side as this

393
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
A base for Taiwan's second science park

394
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
what about this time

395
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Of course it will cause a lot of problems

396
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
There are many places to grab this position

397
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So like the Lu tribe in Kaohsiung at that time

398
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
they want

399
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Why Tainan and not Kaohsiung

400
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
so we have to make noise

401
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The whole society has been making noise

402
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and after

403
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The unit that disrupted the chaos at that time was the National Science Council

404
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The National Science Council will find me

405
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I wonder if there are any ruins here?

406
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
He said that he said that there are many ruins in the Lu nationality.

407
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You can't develop, you will soon destroy the ruins

408
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Later I accepted his commission

409
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,500
In 1984, a half-year investigation was conducted

410
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,000
After investigation, it was found that

411
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,500
Indeed there are ruins

412
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,000
So I gave the National Science Conference at that time

413
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
At that time, the chairman of the committee was Guo Nanhong

414
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Chairman Guo

415
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
i gave the report

416
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I said that there are not only ruins here

417
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And it's full of stars

418
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
why?

419
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
because of this place

420
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,500
To the north is Zeng Wenxi, and over there is the Saltwater Creek

421
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,000
These two rivers are the most prone to flooding

422
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So this trouble in the past

423
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,500
If there is no driver to bother you, a lot of dirt will accumulate

424
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
so few leftovers from the past

425
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,000
buried under the ground

426
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,500
So the ground here

427
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
We reckon it's full of stars

428
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,000
dense like stars

429
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
very relics

430
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I said you will have problems in the future

431
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,500
development will encounter problems

432
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
what about the end

433
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,000
But the whole project has already started

434
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
all booked

435
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So in the end we got approval from the competent authority

436
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We've done a lot of

437
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
salvage excavation

438
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
A small part is keeping it as an in situ reserve

439
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,740
Tainan Science Park

440
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,340
I think everyone knows its location

441
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,940
In Shanhua, in Xinshi, in Anding

442
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,940
Probably its area is more than 1000 hectares

443
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,500
That side is 1043 hectares

444
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,940
This was used as a view of Taitang at that time.

445
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,060
You are dry on this farm

446
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,700
was desolate

447
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,260
that's totally different now

448
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,200
Now it is a very modern science and technology park

449
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,100
Therefore, starting from the 1985 of the Republic of China

450
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,600
we start the rescue

451
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,800
Unexpectedly, it took more than ten years to rescue him once he was rescued.

452
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,600
Why

453
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,000
Nanke continues to develop

454
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,100
Then there are transplants

455
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,900
Then why? Because the sky is full of stars

456
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,300
Stars in the sky basement transplant

457
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,500
So we have been developing

458
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,600
just keep discovering

459
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,500
keep discovering and then have to deal with

460
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
After treatment, we must do rescue

461
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
So we can see as

462
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,300
We have five stages of rescue

463
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,500
From the 1984 of the Republic of China is the first stage

464
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,200
Then the second one is 85 years

465
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,600
The third stage is 92 years

466
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,700
The fourth stage is 94 years

467
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Now it's 94 to 99

468
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,500
Then, five stages of rescue work were done.

469
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,700
Then what we salvage is a large-scale excavation

470
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,200
As a look at this, what we move one by one is the exploration pit we excavated.

471
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,200
As a look at our chairs, each chair is made on a large scale

472
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,700
Excavate as many toys as possible from the ground

473
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,200
in a very systematic record

474
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,200
As a matter of fact, each excavation is such a large-scale excavation.

475
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
are very large

476
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Then we dig the rest at night

477
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Because sometimes when he is constructing

478
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
must be in a hurry

479
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,200
This is our factory building in Qimei’s Qimei

480
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,200
because he said they already took the order

481
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,200
If he does not start work for a day, the factory will not be completed and work will not start

482
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
his loss is a terrible loss

483
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
So what about this matter?

484
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,200
And at the same time, the room is already under construction and all the machines are ready.

485
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,200
So we have to do it within 45 days

486
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
think about these chairs

487
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,400
This is what a staff member does

488
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
are local farmers

489
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,900
Then we became each very experienced archaeologists

490
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,900
This one is that we and my staff were only four people

491
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,400
Finally we got to a few years later

492
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
become such a large and huge team

493
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
That's what everyone does now

494
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Actually they really like working for us

495
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:22,900
why?

496
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,900
Originally they were farmers from nearby villages

497
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,400
Later, their land was confiscated because of the Science Park.

498
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,800
They don't work anymore

499
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,300
so we just happen to have jobs

500
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,300
he has joined us

501
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,300
Still interested in doing this

502
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,300
It makes sense to do this

503
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,800
So we went through 15 years of field work

504
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,300
We have about 50 vents in total

505
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,300
Later, it gradually increased to more than 80 ruins

506
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,300
34 of them

507
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,300
We have extensively excavated

508
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,300
So just now Fu Yuanyang mentioned

509
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,300
We have released several million pieces of these cultural relics in the future

510
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,300
we are not in the warehouse

511
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,300
still need one by one

512
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,300
to be organized

513
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Only then can this history be recreated

514
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Rediscover it from these materials

515
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So this is a support that we have also become the Ministry of Science and Technology.

516
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
We are currently continuing to nine years

517
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Continuously analyzing these cultural relics

518
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Rescue us also works with some technology

519
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
We are like the ones in the hospital, we are like the new cloud doctor, and the doctor is also present

520
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
We he both do analysis of the millet of these rice plants

521
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
There are also some medical analysis, etc.

522
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
We still do these parts

523
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But from inside

524
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
We slowly put at least the 5,000-year history of Nanke in Taiwan

525
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
can build it up

526
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
At this time we are in Nanke as a watch

527
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
All of these found in each of these ruins

528
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Then there are some ruins that are salvaged on a large scale

529
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
massive excavation

530
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
These guys have played a lot

531
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Naughty, Stone, Jade, Bone, Iron, Bronze, etc.

532
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
At the same time, we also found more than 2,000 wooden sticks

533
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It means that there are more than 2,000 human bones

534
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
This human bone is based on osteology

535
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
this is very very important

536
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It not only provides an understanding of the human body in the past

537
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and disease

538
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But the composition of the population etc.

539
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
can provide some very important information

540
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
so now we are a

541
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
About the cultural relics found in Nanke

542
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
can be summed up

543
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Can help it have ten culture periods

544
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The earliest is five thousand years

545
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
about four thousand eight

546
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
up to five thousand

547
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The latest one below can arrive

548
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Han people in the early Ming and Qing Dynasties

549
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So overall we differentiate into

550
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Divided into ten cultural wonders

551
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
In every miracle

552
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
have a very rich content of these

553
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Then inside each content

554
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
can tell us

555
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
a lot of history about the past

556
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So this is what I want today below

557
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Dr Li Fangji

558
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
for each culture period

559
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
like found inside

560
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
and how do we analyze

561
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
doing research?

562
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
to give you a report

563
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm having a hard time

564
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
give you an introduction

565
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
thank you all

566
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
next one

567
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Thank you Vice President Wang

568
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,640
He came to Nanke twice during his tenure

569
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,440
So this is a big thank you for his support and encouragement.

570
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,140
So this can have today

571
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,840
he contributed

572
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,940
This is good

573
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,740
Then I will follow in the footsteps of Mr. Zhang

574
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,740
This Nanke archaeological discovery in Taiwan for 5,000 years

575
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,340
In fact I want to tell you

576
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,580
Just now Mr. Zhang told me to remove this one

577
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,940
I said without your medal

578
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,540
in fact one of each

579
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,680
He has his medal and I have one of mine

580
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,980
But what about the one on the side and the one on the right?

581
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,980
only one

582
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,980
Seems

583
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,980
What about this one?

584
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,980
This is what really explains the content of our award.

585
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,840
Well, of course, if it wasn't for this one

586
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,640
Of course, there seems to be no chance to stand here today.

587
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,120
This is indeed the case

588
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,480
First of all, let me explain to you

589
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,600
I should have no chance

590
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,200
But what about an opportunity like this?

591
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,840
Special thanks to Academician Zhang

592
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:28,000
Academician Zhang didn’t just bring me into Academia Sinica

593
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,760
Even I was able to go to Nanke because of him

594
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,120
1987 Separate Go

595
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,520
His Separate Go, he went to England

596
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,840
He told me before you left

597
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,800
Come and help me lead this project of Nanke

598
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,960
Then I said how do I bring a plan?

599
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,440
He said you don't need a plan

600
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,040
This already has our team over there

601
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,920
In fact, this leadership of my program for that year

602
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:08,500
It's not called a leader, it's actually called a cup of NTD from Nangang to Tainan

603
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,500
I got this kind of treatment very generously

604
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Yes as soon as they see me arriving they know I have money

605
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:27,000
Because at that time I was the one who took the check and went to the Farmer's Bank to collect NT dollars

606
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Then I packed it in the bag with the camera

607
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:42,000
Then when they got on the plane they thought it was a camera

608
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But I also know they probably know what's in there

609
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's not a camera, because the shadow of a camera is different

610
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,500
Then I should say that if there is not such a chance

611
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Then it is not because of this distribution of Nanke archaeological sites

612
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,500
So I have seen what Mr. Zhang said

613
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,000
What is more important is a distribution like this

614
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
This completely subverts the cognition of Taiwan's archaeological circles

615
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Frankly speaking, before the 1995 Republic of China

616
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Not before 1995 in 1995

617
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
No ruins have ever been found in this park.

618
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,000
I used to follow Mr. Zhang

619
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Let's go to the outer ring road of Naner Gao

620
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
The middle of the outer ring road is relatively close

621
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
A site called Kanxi

622
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
on the periphery of the park

623
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
In other words, the entire park

624
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Among the more than 70 ruins discovered so far

625
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Didn't know any before 1995

626
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So at a mileage like this

627
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
This archaeological excavation work in the entire Nanke Park

628
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Transformed Taiwan's archaeological circles

629
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
In particular what we call contract archeology

630
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,500
such a mission

631
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,000
Also found so many of these ruins

632
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So these decades

633
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I frankly say that I am half a Taipei native

634
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I started on July 1, 2007

635
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,500
I have two to three days a week

636
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,000
lived in Tainan

637
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,500
So I think a ban like this

638
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,000
give me a lot of this opportunity

639
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,500
not just academically

640
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,000
in work management

641
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,500
The whole thing got me a lot of these

642
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,000
accumulation of experience

643
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
In fact, I can also take this opportunity

644
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Come to the courtyard, come to the office

645
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
even in my own home

646
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
to illustrate over the years

647
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm such a crackpot

648
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
or

649
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
The high-speed rail should give me some briefings, right?

650
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
good

651
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Speaking of which, I still want to give you an idea first.

652
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
That is to say, the so-called 5,000 years of Taiwan mentioned earlier

653
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Taiwan's 5,000-year history

654
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Mr. Zhang mentioned it to you at the beginning

655
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
The United people said that Taiwan originally had no history

656
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
There is only 400 years of history from the Henan people

657
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But here we want to talk to you

658
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
We have literally five thousand years of history

659
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
what about this

660
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
or so he said

661
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
If you want to convey a concept like this to

662
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
He already had some knowledge of Taiwan's history

663
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
He already told you to lie

664
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
but the fact is not

665
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,240
From the accumulations inside the archaeological site, we

666
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,960
I can tell you

667
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,960
The Nanke Archaeological Site Group has accumulated

668
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,800
Some history of Taiwan over the past 5,000 years

669
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,040
so many years

670
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:20,440
We found more than 2,000 of these sticks

671
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,080
I'm not going to lie to you

672
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,880
I often tell a lot of people in society

673
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,880
Wherever I go, maybe half of them will follow me

674
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,880
Maybe you're next door

675
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,880
And those who followed you next to each other

676
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,880
This is what I told the Nanke Park Administration

677
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,880
I said I have been so ten years

678
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,880
What you see is fantasy

679
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,880
But more than 2,000 of these from 5,000 to 300 years

680
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
What about these grain trees in the past few years?

681
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Their souls have been running on it

682
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I even sometimes

683
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I wish I could tell them

684
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The roof of your building is very black

685
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
then you'll know what that is

686
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
ok that

687
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
In fact, one of the biggest benefits of

688
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
what we found

689
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
It's not just that there are many chairs, it's the same thing

690
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
it is in very good condition

691
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It seems that we can clearly

692
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
to find its source

693
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
its long

694
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
its time complete

695
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Even we have a lot of

696
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
these kinds of diversity

697
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So it seems that what I want to tell you

698
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
From some clusters of chairs that look like this

699
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
we are talking about environmental change

700
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
let's talk about ecological adaptation

701
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,100
We talk about social structures , we talk about living crafts and technologies

702
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:08,060
Even when we talk about life should be and faith, etc.

703
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:13,160
These issues are what give us the opportunity to get to know Taiwan

704
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,900
I have known Taiwan for so many years

705
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,660
How are these people living here?

706
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,160
Just now Mr. Zhang also mentioned

707
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,460
Taiwan has been inhabited here since 30,000 years ago

708
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,620
But inside a pair of glasses at such a time

709
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:38,920
From the old era to the new era

710
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,720
to the Iron Age to the early Han Chinese

711
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,520
when you come here

712
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:54,120
In fact, we still have a lot of gaps that we don't understand clearly

713
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
in other words

714
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
tell you

715
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I specially drew a red circle here

716
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
sorry

717
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
If this is in your history textbook

718
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
there will be a witness

719
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
The witness also claimed to have a time of 30,000 years ago

720
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
But recently

721
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
One of our colleagues was originally a student of mine

722
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Teacher at Tsinghua University

723
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
As a result, only three thousand years were withdrawn as witnesses.

724
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Originally, Mayor Lai wanted to take that specimen back.

725
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I think now he doesn't want it either

726
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
good

727
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Another fact I want to mention to you is that

728
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
From the Changbing Culture 30,000 years ago

729
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
until the new period we now know

730
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Early Age Crash

731
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:10,000
We have no specific archaeological accumulations in this period

732
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
This also shows that this group of people in the early days of the new era

733
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Not this group of people from Changbing culture

734
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
a continuation of life

735
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
This continuation of life comes from

736
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Under such an understanding

737
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
i want to tell you

738
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
When did Taiwan become Taiwan?

739
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
this question is difficult to answer

740
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Did someone say you were talking about politics?

741
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I don't hide from you

742
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I was once inside the opportunity where the minister of culture led a group of journalists

743
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I asked them the same question

744
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Some say tens of millions of years, millions of years

745
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I said when did Taiwan leave a connection with mainland China

746
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Many people are stupid over there

747
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
18,000 years ago, Taiwan could still use roads and bridges to walk

748
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Arrive in mainland China

749
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
But in fact by 8000 years

750
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
The Taiwan Strait has been formed

751
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
If this understanding is correct when

752
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,000
After 8000 years, there is no such fact that 8000 years have come to Taiwan

753
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
archaeological evidence

754
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
In the early days of the New Reality Era, within our 5,6000 years

755
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,320
what must this group of people be like

756
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,920
Is it enough

757
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,320
slipping slipping slipping boat

758
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,320
Otherwise, it's swimming

759
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,820
In fact it is impossible

760
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,040
In such an understanding

761
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,680
Let's look back at our Nanke Yuan District

762
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,800
In this more than 2000 hectares

763
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,380
stacked inside

764
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:32,020
It also provides some process of our whole environment change

765
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,780
I want to tell you

766
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:39,160
This is what Mr. Zhang just mentioned

767
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,420
Nanke in 1995

768
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,620
yes

769
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,020
Cemetery

770
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,220
Inano Cemetery

771
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,420
Inano Farm

772
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,900
The whole thing is so dry

773
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,780
There is another western orifice

774
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,580
because they are burden bearers

775
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,580
so

776
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,880
A lot of chairs never get a chance to be flipped open first

777
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,240
Because you planted this is only a shallow root, forty or fifty centimeters

778
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,800
they can just plant

779
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:21,000
Well, Nanke in 2012 is a sight like this

780
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,800
you can imagine

781
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,420
A change in the environment of the entire southwestern coast of Taiwan

782
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,260
what will it be like

783
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,260
When I was really straight

784
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:40,260
Some people even say that it is impossible to find the ruins in this place

785
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,620
Why?

786
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:46,260
Because it was originally in a water environment

787
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,260
This understanding is not bad

788
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,980
If you look at this map

789
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,580
This is a map of city descendants, an elevated map of city descendants

790
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,580
At certain times the entire park is

791
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,440
Still in the water environment

792
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,520
We make from many places

793
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,280
Taiwan restrictions Many restrictions

794
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,160
can be found

795
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,400
They also had records saying

796
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,040
The whole big ship can go all the way here

797
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,800
In a location where the so-called Newport is located

798
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:28,400
Okay, this is what Mr. Zhang just showed to everyone

799
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,080
Our Sanjin is still doing it in the middle of the night

800
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,160
Not called Sanjin Midnight

801
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,720
In fact at that time

802
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,760
do it from 7:30 in the morning

803
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,160
until half past ten in the evening

804
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,320
Chi Mei, but it's not called Chi Mei anymore

805
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,280
This is what happened

806
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,720
Innolux

807
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,120
they asked us

808
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,480
It means a loss of 100 million a day

809
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,680
if we can afford it

810
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,640
But archeology can have 100 million

811
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,320
I think maybe Mr. Zhang also has a clue.

812
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,480
he sold several

813
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
can't sell the house

814
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
good

815
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
This is the current surface

816
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
what about this ruins

817
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
In this way, there are seven meters

818
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
everybody

819
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
you can then

820
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
when we were doing exploration

821
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
you can find

822
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
such a deep pile

823
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
in other words

824
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
five thousand years

825
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Its a stack of seven meters

826
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
If a change in the entire geographical environment

827
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
such a data

828
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
The data is also very fast

829
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
we follow

830
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
One of Mr. Chen Wenshan's

831
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Under the synergy

832
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
He made a transfer of the entire address

833
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Judgment and Restoration of the Coastline

834
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
That let us also find out

835
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
A location where the entire circle is located

836
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:07,500
would happen to be near a coastline where it was 5,000 years ago

837
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,500
So we can clearly understand

838
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,500
From a change in the entire coastal environment

839
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,000
until 6000 years ago

840
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,500
The entire Nanke Park is still in the water

841
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,000
By the year 5000 we started to enter

842
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,000
Just now Mr. Zhang also explained

843
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,000
Because there is Zeng Wenxi in the north and Yanshuixi in the south

844
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
There is a river shortfall on the west coast of Taiwan

845
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,000
and when it rains

846
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:46,500
It can bring a large amount of sediment to accumulate very quickly

847
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,000
in fact here

848
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,500
I also want to share with you a piece of news like this

849
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,000
what commonday magazine did

850
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
You know what problem we are facing now

851
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Global warming, this is a fact, a geologist in Australia in 1993, what he did would cause a sea level rise of three centimeters every year

852
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:31,000
If you start with a count rate like this, if you flood 6 meters, 15 meters, 25 meters, everyone knows that this is a balance

853
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:38,000
If you have a sense of crisis when you see this, I will show you this again

854
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:57,000
In 2080, Wonsan Hotel, probably I know that when you go out, the second thing is to call Wonsan Hotel immediately, if there is any space above the tenth floor, you can just buy it

855
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:07,000
It was 2080, Wonsan Hotel probably knew the current situation, now it is 2080, Wonsan Hotel probably knew the current situation, you can just buy

856
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
2010 101

857
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
of course i will say

858
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
In 2080

859
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
i'm on the mountain behind

860
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
wave with everyone

861
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
good

862
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
then this is one

863
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
environmental change

864
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
a difference in rate

865
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
everybody

866
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
one like this

867
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
under the concept

868
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Let's see Nanke

869
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Nanke for so many years

870
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
let us

871
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
know

872
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
From 5000 until

873
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Late entry

874
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Two or three hundred years

875
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
even

876
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
we can see

877
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
the last 20 years

878
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
all the whole

879
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
a change in the environment

880
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
people coming and going

881
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
what did we see

882
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
5000 years ago

883
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I want to give you

884
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
look first

885
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Naughty Supply's Technology

886
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
a change of

887
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Everyone too

888
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
if you have a concept

889
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
you can all understand

890
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,840
In the early century era Dabunkeng culture was fascinated by Wentao

891
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,000
One of their trances Wen Tao

892
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,160
It is just a feature of the appearance and shape of a whole pottery

893
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,840
actually real content

894
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,200
one of its appearance

895
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,560
how does it do

896
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,440
What kind of soil is it made of?

897
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,000
What kind of technology was used to develop it?

898
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,440
This is what we really want to understand

899
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,760
You can also see a variety of

900
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,160
Except for the god Wentao

901
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,280
its shape

902
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,000
this is a bean

903
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,720
This is Chai Tao

904
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:49,280
This chai pottery is not the most primitive and recognized one

905
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,880
one of the cultural characteristics

906
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,760
Even from an element like this, we can

907
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,760
to understand the inner relationship of its culture

908
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
this is a gas cap

909
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:10,000
This is covered by a shell of blood and sweat

910
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Remember Academician Zhang Guangze

911
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
A theory put forward by Academician Zhang Guangze

912
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
He from a decorative document like this

913
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
To illustrate the top of the Phu Quocton ruins in Kinmen

914
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
He also explained the same

915
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
This may have a relationship above the Culture class circle relationship

916
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Well, four thousand years ago

917
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Guys, on our archaeological culture

918
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
We call it Xishen Wentao

919
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Or call it Shenwen red pottery culture

920
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
but you can find out

921
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
The whole appearance situation has changed

922
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,380
We even found four sticks

923
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,680
We call it "Hongguan"

924
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,780
Here is the child's body

925
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,320
children's shares

926
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,340
inside

927
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:19,460
This is also the earliest in Taiwan

928
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,280
A record of this "Hongguan"

929
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,920
We can even see a variety of

930
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,740
But you obviously you can find out

931
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,780
It is the same as the 5000 years ago

932
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,580
are different

933
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:36,840
good

934
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,160
this is an escape

935
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,280
Also stated let us know they made the escape themselves

936
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,100
A legacy of such a tool

937
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,940
The Great Lakes culture to 3000 years ago

938
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,540
You can see it right away

939
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,080
it's black

940
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,900
so red hot red

941
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,100
This technique changes to slightly horizontal black

942
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,400
Then how do you think about it?

943
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,100
it's a group of people

944
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:14,400
A different group of people came here

945
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:21,800
What makes us depressed is how come

946
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:26,700
why come

947
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:31,800
Until the Iron Age 2000 years ago

948
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,500
What kind of red color has the whole process technology changed into?

949
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,800
And you can find out

950
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,100
Is it one of their crafting techniques?

951
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,700
has slowly declined

952
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,200
What a change

953
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,700
red to black

954
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,600
black to red

955
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:59,400
Even the whole appearance is different.

956
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,740
This is even the gas cap you can find, the same as the gas cap from 5,000 years ago

957
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:11,280
The air cap from 5,000 years ago is inside our life now

958
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,460
can also see the very common air-shaped

959
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:21,760
We can even find that as far as the Iron Age

960
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,400
A gaseous shape characteristic of the symbol of this puppet

961
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:34,860
More than 500 years ago, we thought it belonged to

962
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:39,600
Inside a legacy of Hirayan culture

963
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:45,840
The most important thing is that they still retain the iron age

964
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,160
The making of soft pottery of Niaosong culture

965
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,720
At the same time they also have a lot of these from mainland China

966
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,720
There are also some from Southeast Asia

967
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
There is also this one from Kyushu Feitian, Japan

968
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,000
One of these mischievous remnants of shaker making

969
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
These are all explained

970
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
These people who live in Tainan at the same time

971
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
How are you from other places?

972
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
interact with one of their living environments

973
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
The evidence that remains

974
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Well, these people from 5,000 years ago

975
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
let us know

976
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
They are likely to be heavily dependent on

977
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:46,000
marine resources food resources

978
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Why because from what remains of our animal bones

979
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
We found that there are a large number of

980
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
These numbers of boruids exceed those of land-based

981
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
what remains of these fish

982
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
in our knowledge

983
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:10,000
We found three different species of these cartilaginous fish

984
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
For example, a shark's, a fish's, a bite, a giant bite

985
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Nineteen species of bony fishes

986
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
These are actually us

987
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
make real professional

988
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,000
helped us identify

989
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
for example this

990
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,000
This is in our earliest cognition

991
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,000
Thought it was going to be this head of an amphibian

992
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Turns out it was a shark

993
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,000
This is this fish near the mouth of the river

994
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
This is what we found out last year

995
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
We first called it mangosteen

996
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
i traveled all over europe

997
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Go to France, to Germany, to Japan, to the United States to ask what this is

998
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
As a result no one can recognize

999
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:22,000
We even got the University of York in the UK to do puthi for us

1000
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:30,000
But the analysis of white matter seems to want to know what the animal would look like

1001
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:39,000
It turned out that last year an assistant at the Museum of Marine Biology

1002
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
He went to Belgium to study his doctorate

1003
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
He told us that this is a monitoring department in Huiqingjiao

1004
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Everyone, this animal was beaten by humans

1005
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
In other words, after they hit these fish

1006
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
They also used one of his supervisory news departments as a supervisory news department

1007
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
a decoration to use

1008
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,500
good

1009
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,000
except fish

1010
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,500
they use a lot

1011
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:10,500
shellfish

1012
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,000
We were five thousand years ago

1013
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
South Guan Li Dong Healing Inside

1014
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,200
have more than

1015
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,200
Seventy-seven different kinds of these shellfish

1016
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,000
good

1017
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,000
how do we learn about these shellfish

1018
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,500
Director Wang is here

1019
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,000
i want to take this opportunity

1020
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,500
Special thanks also to Director Wang

1021
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,000
President Wang Teacher Wang

1022
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,500
When I was doing my doctoral thesis

1023
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
make shellfish

1024
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,500
In addition to identification

1025
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
We do the analysis of probing isotopes

1026
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,000
Analysis of Probe Isotopes

1027
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,000
To understand the water environment

1028
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,500
Analysis of trophic isotopes

1029
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,500
To understand the temperature of the water body

1030
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,500
That is to say, from the temperature of the water body

1031
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,500
let's find out

1032
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,100
when were these shellfish caught

1033
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,900
when did you step on it

1034
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,600
because shellfish when he was alive

1035
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,200
every day he grows

1036
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,800
one of his growth

1037
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,200
while growing

1038
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,100
he will record

1039
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:20,100
A content of the aquatic environment of his life history

1040
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,100
good

1041
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,200
from Nanguanli

1042
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,800
This is a statistical analysis of Yuzi in Nanguanli

1043
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,400
we found

1044
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,300
This so-called Ke Wenhai Scroll

1045
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,900
Internet Scroll

1046
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,500
Can you find out

1047
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,200
This is like what we are eating now

1048
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,800
Chick Ray's body type

1049
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,100
I even want to tell you

1050
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,000
five thousand years

1051
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,400
eat this chick ray

1052
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,800
or the so-called sea rolls

1053
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,200
method is the same

1054
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,200
just put that head

1055
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,200
remove and suck

1056
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,760
Yes or no

1057
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,920
Everyone should have experience with this hat.

1058
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,280
In particular, let me explain to you

1059
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,080
this is

1060
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,520
I want to talk to you

1061
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,720
We all live in a test room

1062
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,600
Apart from eating shellfish, these people

1063
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,840
They even used those shells as tools

1064
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,160
This is an extinct window

1065
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,960
or Yunmuge

1066
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,120
Besides eating shells, they

1067
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,240
In addition to eating shellfish

1068
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,040
Shells are also used as shell knives

1069
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,040
You can see these sentences

1070
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,360
we have asked

1071
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,560
an archaeologist who specializes in this oceania

1072
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,640
he came to tell us

1073
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,400
This is likely to be in

1074
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:11,000
It is a tool for removing the skin of sweet potatoes and sweet potatoes like this kind of follow-up

1075
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:21,000
In addition to eating and using them, everyone also uses them as a water product for wooden sticks

1076
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:29,960
We even think that its probable representative social status

1077
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,600
They even have so-called symbols of faith

1078
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Why? Most of the time we see only five thousand years ago.

1079
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:47,600
They put shells on top of their ears and noses

1080
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,600
They made a lot of these shells as an ornament

1081
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:59,600
The analysis of carbon and oxygen isoples we performed

1082
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,960
Want to understand from 5000 years, 4000 years, 3000 years, 2000 years

1083
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:13,120
These shellfish extant in these ruins until late

1084
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,360
What kind of environment did you grow up in?

1085
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:23,600
What time and season are these communities collecting

1086
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:29,600
Well, this is just a little introduction to you first.

1087
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,600
this is a letter

1088
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:38,600
We go from the top of the shell to this edge of the shell

1089
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:43,600
Then every other this distance

1090
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,600
let's sample it

1091
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,600
Take a sample of it and there's something called calcium carbonate in it

1092
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:56,600
give us a chance to extract its carbon and oxygen

1093
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,600
to understand one of them

1094
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
A cultivation of the same quality

1095
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Okay, so this is what we started from Dabankeng

1096
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Five thousand years ago to Niuzhou paper

1097
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
This is about four thousand years old

1098
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Let's analyze a sample of it

1099
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
to understand in the aquatic environment

1100
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
So most of the food is in Hehaikou

1101
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
A remnant closer to a freshwater environment

1102
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
This is from the Great Lakes Culture and the Bird Culture

1103
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
A comparison of what we see when

1104
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
They are almost all in the same water environment.

1105
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Even Sheila's

1106
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
So our observation like this

1107
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
we are accompanied by the present

1108
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
what we can collect

1109
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
These records of temperature and rainfall in the southwestern waters of Taiwan

1110
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
let's see it

1111
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,400
some of their variations

1112
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:09,000
And then comparing these different seasons that we're seeing

1113
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,200
One oxygen composition of all these carbon-oxygen isotopes

1114
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:18,400
So in an analysis like this

1115
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,200
we can find out

1116
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:28,400
A distance from the Nanke ruins where it is now

1117
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,600
with the coastline

1118
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:36,900
In fact, a change in the water environment is not big

1119
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,900
is very similar

1120
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,800
But we found

1121
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,400
Like, say, this is a telescope screw

1122
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,800
This is mangrove insurance

1123
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,000
this is blood and sweat

1124
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,600
This is window north is extinct

1125
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:56,000
Is that man-made or a change in the environment?

1126
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
One of the resources responsible for these multipliers

1127
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:07,000
We started with these Taiwanese assistants who entered the latest

1128
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Inside a map from about four hundred years ago

1129
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
can also be found

1130
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
A change in the environment of these waters

1131
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
with what we see now

1132
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
that way

1133
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
we can also understand

1134
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Inland it contributes to the whole environment

1135
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Sensitivity is likely

1136
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,000
not easy enough to give them a chance

1137
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
to adapt and survive

1138
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
So especially those types of backs that I just saw

1139
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
The only difference is

1140
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
what you know now

1141
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
What is the most famous snack in Taiwan called?

1142
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
wow really

1143
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
It won't be a small bar

1144
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,160
I spent two years following Ke Ming of Qigude

1145
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,260
There is a man named Conan

1146
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:14,160
This Conan belongs to Haiyan Institute of National Taiwan University

1147
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,740
half read

1148
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:20,540
Then I grabbed a few Konuli

1149
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:24,840
Go to his boss and say I quit

1150
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,960
I'm going home to plant Ke

1151
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,960
yes

1152
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,560
But everybody

1153
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,460
just said that

1154
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,360
In fact, I want to tell you

1155
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,560
a change in the environment

1156
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:45,820
What is caused is a change in environmental resources

1157
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:50,360
One of the above patterns adapted to humans

1158
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,760
an application of the strategy

1159
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,420
This is what we often think about

1160
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,520
good

1161
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Four thousand years ago, these shells had spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and they were almost average, which reflected what it might be like. They had shells in spring, summer, autumn and winter, and they were not enough to eat because they were grown by themselves.

1162
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Four thousand years ago, there were many springs and winters, a little less autumn, and almost no summer.

1163
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:39,000
More than 3,000 years ago were also spring, summer, autumn, and winter, so these Han people who came in from 5,000, 4, and 3,000 years until the late arrival,

1164
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Living in the same environment in the southwestern waters of Taiwan, how to use these shellfish resources, this is to provide us with a very clear understanding.

1165
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Yes, in fact, in 2004, I was on the first floor of the southwestern waters of Taiwan,

1166
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:09,000
At the request of the former vice president Zhu Jinyi and Mr. Zhu

1167
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
At that time, it seemed that Vice President Wang asked me to write it.

1168
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Taiwan's first rice and first dog

1169
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,000
In fact, we also want to thank our teacher Xi

1170
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Teacher Xi is the rice and millet that his team gave us the opportunity to really know

1171
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:43,000
We even recently discovered that there was more than one kind of millet five thousand years ago

1172
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Let Teacher Xi tell the story behind this

1173
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
But the most important meaning is where

1174
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
when we started school

1175
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
twenty years ago thirty years ago

1176
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
To rice will spread to Taiwan

1177
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
At least after 3000 AD

1178
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
things that can happen

1179
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Results of Nanke's Discovery

1180
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Destroyed all previous acquaintances

1181
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
This is a very typical

1182
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
very specific answer

1183
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
from different times

1184
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
five thousand four thousand three thousand

1185
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
until the latest

1186
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
We start from the morphometric

1187
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
got to know them when

1188
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
whatever you want

1189
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
one content on rice left over

1190
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Take Nanguanli five thousand years ago

1191
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
with four thousand years ago

1192
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
let's do a comparison

1193
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Small grain rice Medium grain rice Large grain rice

1194
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Compare it like this

1195
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
we can find out

1196
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
how about some of them

1197
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:17,000
This means that our own technology allows them to have the development of the whole concept

1198
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:25,000
So we can also infer what kind of species they are planning.

1199
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:36,000
These are all things that give us the opportunity to witness the content of agricultural cultivation in Taiwan over the past 5,000 years

1200
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:47,000
It is the legacy that I mentioned to you just now that there are 2,000 in Nanke and now there are nearly 2,500

1201
01:01:47,000 --> 01:02:00,000
These remnants from 5,000 years ago you can see and see is an official form of health care straight limbs and their heads

1202
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,320
They are all facing south, can you guys find them?

1203
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,720
such a consistency

1204
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:13,760
Many times when we go to give speeches in different places

1205
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,100
someone will bring it up

1206
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,900
So how do they buy it?

1207
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:23,280
Was there a paper back needle or a paper blue needle five thousand years ago?

1208
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,900
Do you have?

1209
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,940
Can anyone tell me how they buy it?

1210
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,940
look at the sky

1211
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,940
look at the sky

1212
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:47,140
Come, come, you are already the one you know the most

1213
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:50,940
Hurry up and give you something first

1214
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,940
this

1215
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,940
Classic magazine helped us out

1216
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,940
Yes, look at the sky, when will it come?

1217
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,840
I look at it at night, do you buy it at night when you buy it?

1218
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,160
Buy during the day and watch at night

1219
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:12,360
I'll sort this out when I get back.

1220
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:16,160
You are all my providers of this information

1221
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,560
At that time, my speech fee will also be taken out.

1222
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,760
Get it out

1223
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,440
ok guys did you see this

1224
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,600
one-on-one

1225
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,760
Is this a standard monogamous account?

1226
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,760
Teacher Li Li Aping

1227
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,160
How many people are there now?

1228
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,360
I didn't say it was you who said it

1229
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,360
ok this is one

1230
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,360
But in fact they are different

1231
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,960
More than 80% have very high consistency

1232
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,120
how do we explain these

1233
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,120
Surprise or what?

1234
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:08,000
At this time, we sometimes think about whether they are the same group of people

1235
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
If it's not when they're in the same group

1236
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
They treat the dead differently

1237
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:23,000
We can even see the disturbing

1238
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
if you are more specific

1239
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,000
This one is in the ash pit not in the real male tree

1240
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
The so-called one of their male wood-shaped system above

1241
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Well, Guanmu already existed five thousand years ago

1242
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
This is the viewing board pressed against this individual

1243
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
So you can also know

1244
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Using wooden coffins is not something we have now

1245
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Four thousand years ago in Taiwan already had

1246
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
four thousand years ago

1247
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
one of their males

1248
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,340
Jinmu Xingzi is the whole strip

1249
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:08,600
also face male

1250
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,360
Health straight limb

1251
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,200
The difference is what they already have

1252
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,200
Bow off

1253
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,800
These bows are key to our understanding

1254
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,360
two years or younger

1255
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,200
a rational way of doing this

1256
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,800
such a life theory

1257
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,600
one way of treating

1258
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,800
It's beyond our imagination

1259
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:40,400
Everyone, in fact, when we discovered

1260
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,800
never thought what this is

1261
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,800
Because I haven't seen the bones yet

1262
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:49,000
We even ran to Echime Hospital

1263
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,400
Go borrow Potable's X-ray

1264
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,600
I can't even take a photo

1265
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,400
As a result, we really

1266
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,600
it's clearing slowly

1267
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,000
Only found out after clearing

1268
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
There is indeed a staff

1269
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
well , 3000 years ago

1270
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Guys, can you see it?

1271
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Each cane is a handful

1272
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
three five six eight

1273
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
There are adults, there are children

1274
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
This is for adults, this is for children

1275
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
But the way their heads are facing

1276
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
has changed

1277
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
towards the north

1278
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Even the way of one of their rods

1279
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
After shepherding

1280
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
above the head, thirty to fifty centimeters

1281
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
ranging from twenty to thirty centimeters

1282
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
There's a funerary jar on it

1283
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,000
This is also what we had in this era more than 3,000 years ago.

1284
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
trees that were able to receive these jars very intact

1285
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
most evidence

1286
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Everyone can also understand that there are all kinds of different views

1287
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Not just in the thick

1288
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,000
We even found that some are placed on the ground first

1289
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Then take the pot upside down and the upside down one

1290
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Well, we even found headless

1291
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Some are not accompanied by shells like those five thousand years ago.

1292
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:45,000
There is a back and a back is the kind of necklace with a back

1293
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,000
They reflect men's online crimes

1294
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
women follow interview

1295
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Some are different from Yugou and so on.

1296
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,080
By the Iron Age, the whole reason for life changed

1297
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:09,360
At this time, one of their barriers

1298
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:17,800
Knowledge remains the same, head to the north, straight

1299
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:21,560
But some of them found

1300
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:26,200
What we found was that he took the pieces of the head first

1301
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:30,240
paved on the ground, and then the human individual

1302
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:36,640
put it on top, there is indeed a

1303
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,640
Peach tube , but no longer what

1304
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:44,360
Thirty to fifty centimeters above the head, fifty or sixty centimeters high

1305
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,840
this place, above this place

1306
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:52,160
Yes, these are all for us to understand

1307
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,520
a change in these cultures

1308
01:08:54,520 --> 01:09:00,000
Is it the difference between people? Or the difference in the whole era?

1309
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
And with

1310
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,500
we also found

1311
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:07,140
this person

1312
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,560
His head was given in a clay basin

1313
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,120
put it away

1314
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,760
This will be explained to you later

1315
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,600
this is what we think

1316
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,940
Another evidence of headhunting

1317
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,560
good

1318
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,680
As here we can find that

1319
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:26,680
He uses

1320
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:30,000
into the limb bones to make this

1321
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,720
Link Force Fishhook

1322
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,040
accompanied by

1323
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,780
next to the individual

1324
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,000
in this era

1325
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Besides this

1326
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
They are even accompanied by

1327
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:42,320
ironware

1328
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,360
the only difference

1329
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,800
bath gas replaced by glassware

1330
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,280
good

1331
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:52,800
what's next

1332
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,500
Let me introduce one more

1333
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,520
Taiwan's logistics economy

1334
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,800
Taiwan's logistics economy is not

1335
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,260
only now

1336
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,840
I often think

1337
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,400
The transportation in Taiwan is inconvenient and inconvenient

1338
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:10,500
let me experience it myself

1339
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:14,600
Just now the dean said that I am in Hengchun

1340
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:19,700
Yes, when I started working in Hengchun in 1993

1341
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,000
at that time

1342
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:27,400
On the first day, I have to take the train to Kaohsiung to stay overnight.

1343
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:32,260
At six o'clock the next morning, take the Guoguang ship to Hengchun

1344
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:33,800
Inconvenient

1345
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,860
really inconvenient

1346
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:40,700
Sometimes I can't catch the Guoguang number

1347
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:42,000
you want to take a wild bike

1348
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,040
you still worry

1349
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,340
near marriage

1350
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:47,360
yes

1351
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:48,900
But

1352
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:51,460
you never thought

1353
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:54,540
Logistics in Taiwan started five thousand years ago

1354
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:57,360
surprise you

1355
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,420
scheming

1356
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:00,420
this is my favorite

1357
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
It's not this bullshit

1358
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,100
you guys know what this is

1359
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,100
Taiwan domain

1360
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,300
Taiwan domain

1361
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:14,780
Is it everywhere in Taiwan?

1362
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:16,780
Where

1363
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,740
Clam

1364
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:24,100
who said the wind

1365
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:29,360
The one I can't post here

1366
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,360
basically for you

1367
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,360
come on and write

1368
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,360
Thanks

1369
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,360
good

1370
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,360
How did the domain of Fengtian reach Tainan five thousand years ago

1371
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,360
sorry i should have brought it to you

1372
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,360
Thanks

1373
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,360
how come thank you

1374
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,360
yes

1375
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,360
domain arrow

1376
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,360
domain collapse

1377
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:57,360
The one on the far right lets call it

1378
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,360
Although basalt

1379
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,360
certainly

1380
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Teacher Chen Wenshan is not here, he scolds us every time

1381
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Why do you choose Wuyan when you see an infection, and you think it’s from Penghu?

1382
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:15,000
How did Penghu come here five thousand years ago?

1383
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:23,000
You're so loud, so brave, give you one

1384
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Thank you, let you get to know Brother Nan better when I go home

1385
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Well, how did these baths from 5,000 years ago come to Tainan?

1386
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:46,000
It doesn't matter. Four thousand years ago, people were still doing bathing?

1387
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,000
They still have baths, but what?

1388
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,000
What about the bath rings? How about all of them?

1389
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
How is it still clear?

1390
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
still above his elbow

1391
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
yes

1392
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
3000 years ago

1393
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Wow

1394
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
This string, this string, we want this and that

1395
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
see how much

1396
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:25,000
yes

1397
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,000
5000 years 4000 years 3000 years

1398
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,000
This group of people live on the southwest coast of Taiwan

1399
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
how did they come

1400
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
How come there are these so-called

1401
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Toyota from Hualien

1402
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
come these baths

1403
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
pretty

1404
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
These really make us

1405
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
very surprised

1406
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Are they a group of people?

1407
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
specialized in these trades

1408
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
There is another group of people who specialize in

1409
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,880
The people who made these crafts

1410
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:09,460
Or do they know how to find these people themselves?

1411
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:13,400
for exchange

1412
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:19,820
Of course they are so-called noble artifacts

1413
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:23,560
Absolutely we can believe

1414
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,080
I just showed you this

1415
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,960
This is also found in the ruins of "Shanbaopi"

1416
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:31,580
like this individual above

1417
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:35,120
Two or three hundred of these pre-tube beads

1418
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,480
Speaking of which

1419
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,120
I also want to introduce to you

1420
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:45,220
Just now the dean also mentioned

1421
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:47,580
Mr Zhang also mentioned

1422
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:53,160
Taiwan as an Austronesian Aboriginal

1423
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:57,580
a base on which the nation resides

1424
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:59,740
Mr. Zhang Guangzhi

1425
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
in 1987

1426
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,420
He wrote very clearly

1427
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:06,420
In an article like this

1428
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,920
described

1429
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,420
On the traceability of the South Island

1430
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:13,420
From the perspective of the garden-like relationship of culture

1431
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:17,420
what can we discover

1432
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:20,260
rental dog for hunting

1433
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:23,000
Make naughty, make columns, etc.

1434
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,660
come down like this

1435
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:27,160
with seafaring technology and with barkcloth

1436
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:30,160
Wait, there are rice and millet ones

1437
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:33,160
is from the above

1438
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,160
everybody

1439
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,160
vaguely should be able to understand

1440
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:41,160
Taiwan as a

1441
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:45,160
A Yuan Township of Minamishimabara Democracy

1442
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:48,160
doesn't seem too much

1443
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:51,160
1910 1910

1444
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:55,160
In a record of Ugly Nosuke

1445
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,160
he can see

1446
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:59,160
This is definitely not Wu Feng's story

1447
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:09,800
Well, the scene that the Dutch saw when they came to Tainan,

1448
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:15,900
This is what our ornithine culture saw 2000 years ago. A headhunter,

1449
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:22,300
These wooden sticks without heads seen 3000 years ago,

1450
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:30,200
and the three fist teeth we saw 5,000 years ago,

1451
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,800
They also pierced a hole,

1452
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:41,700
Teacher Zhang Guangren also thinks that this is all left over from evidence from a headhunter.

1453
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:46,200
So 5000 years all the way down,

1454
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,900
There seems to be a thread,

1455
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:55,800
Let us tell us about the inner relationship between these ancestors,

1456
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,100
Yes or no?

1457
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:00,100
and another,

1458
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
a custom of tooth extraction

1459
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
In the material of our national system

1460
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,000
We can still see and chase

1461
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Explained again and again

1462
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Did they follow these peoples

1463
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
a close relationship

1464
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Bark Cloth Sticks These Faux Wheels

1465
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
braiding

1466
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
the tools they use

1467
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Finally I told you

1468
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
When did the Han people start coming in?

1469
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
The culture of the Han people began to come in in large numbers

1470
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Definitely not a post-1949 thing

1471
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:51,000
What we saw in Tainan

1472
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I used to talk to Tainan's new style

1473
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
used to be the mayor

1474
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I said that the new style used to be outside Taiwan

1475
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
The first place to meet international standards

1476
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
He said I was kissing his ass

1477
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Teacher Zhu is here

1478
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Miss Zhu, can you

1479
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Teacher Zhu is a caring person

1480
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
The Heart Has the Earliest Church

1481
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Definitely not Wanhua

1482
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Definitely not Wanjin

1483
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Definitely not freshwater

1484
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
ass church

1485
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
It's something on your mind, right?

1486
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
But I still want to tell you

1487
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
you wait and see

1488
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
an entry into these material cultures

1489
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Indeed a large number of these come in

1490
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
In our Han settlements

1491
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,000
where we meet the aborigines

1492
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Industry in the Tang Department

1493
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Yes, earlier than Henan people have entered the southwestern coast of Taiwan, especially the wells in Tainan area,

1494
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:26,000
That is to say, water wells are not only used by Han people, we have so-called soil wells four thousand years ago,

1495
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:34,000
But knowing how to make it like this is definitely a technique that Han people have.

1496
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Bullock carts, Taiwan does not have cattle, Taiwan has cattle brought in from outside, as if I want to tell you, the number one dog in Taiwan that I did not talk about today,

1497
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
There are no dogs in Taiwan. Dogs in Taiwan are brought in by people.

1498
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:03,000
This concept, everyone should know that only Han people have it.

1499
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
curtain

1500
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:05,340
Ladies and gentlemen, we have seen the curtain five thousand years ago

1501
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:08,000
The curtain of four thousand years ago, until now

1502
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:11,280
iron age right? yes

1503
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,440
Is there such a pattern?

1504
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,180
No, this is what Han people have

1505
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:21,960
When will it happen? Han people will come in in large numbers

1506
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,660
After bringing in one of his etiquette rules,

1507
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,420
they will have such a

1508
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:32,100
This is solid evidence

1509
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:34,440
Do you believe in Buddhism?

1510
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:36,500
Whole Buddha Mother

1511
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,460
Whole Buddha Mother

1512
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:42,120
inside our screen

1513
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,960
For this copper coin, he took his original

1514
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:49,380
The lines on the pillars on the surface were worn away

1515
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,140
Ko's

1516
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:55,340
Yes, this also explains

1517
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:56,580
Taiwan

1518
01:20:57,020 --> 01:21:00,180
When will the mother of the whole Buddha, this branch, come?

1519
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Originally, they all thought that when Zheng Chenggong came in, what year was it?

1520
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:16,000
There is no high school, everyone is in the fourth grade and fifth grade, forget it

1521
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
1662

1522
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:28,000
This, this, this, no, Mr. Xing, I will give you a copy later

1523
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Yes, Hengran came in 1624

1524
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Zheng Chenggong came in 1662,38 years

1525
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:44,000
However, such a time is different from what we now know about Qingkang in 1684.

1526
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
caused by that time, even earlier

1527
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
This is all explained, how about it, the Han people came in

1528
01:21:53,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I was dumbfounded when I saw this one, once I was a child

1529
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,020
I'll talk about what's on my mind

1530
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:06,000
they see this

1531
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,120
they say no

1532
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,840
Little ones love to scrape off

1533
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,540
My Taiwanese is not correct

1534
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:14,840
everyone is still laughing

1535
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,340
The company came out because of the chairs in the company

1536
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,080
The thing about the chair coming out of the company

1537
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,840
This is ironclad evidence

1538
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,540
deer feet do it

1539
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,480
Deer's foot to carve out

1540
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,720
four different

1541
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:35,220
Now scraping off is four, right?

1542
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:36,220
yes

1543
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:40,120
China's earliest eighth to twelfth centuries

1544
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,720
Dice of the eighth century

1545
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,280
good

1546
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,480
Speaking of this

1547
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:48,120
archeology

1548
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,920
actually tell you

1549
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,820
Our ins and outs beyond ink

1550
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,480
I often say

1551
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,680
Archeology

1552
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,920
nothing good actually

1553
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
But archeology is the experience of life

1554
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I experience different chairs inside

1555
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
the story of my life told

1556
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
i got inside the archaeological chair

1557
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I go to learn other people's culture

1558
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,000
no good or bad

1559
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
no high or low

1560
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
you can say

1561
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,000
This group of people fit in well or not

1562
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Because every chair is like

1563
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
a group of people live there

1564
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
live after a certain time

1565
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
they left

1566
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Whether the reason for leaving is good or bad

1567
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
either positive or negative

1568
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
This is what we need from

1569
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
A pile of archaeological chairs inside

1570
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
come tell us

1571
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:59,000
But what I want to say about life and choices

1572
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,360
Time is changing this year, the environment is changing

1573
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:07,680
Many times borrowed from Tolstoy's

1574
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,680
Still borrowing from Tolstoy

1575
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:13,480
Once you leave the path you are used to

1576
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,480
we'll think we're lost

1577
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,480
But what?

1578
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:21,480
we are under our feet

1579
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:26,480
A brand-new Kangzhuang Avenue is just about to open

1580
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:29,480
i hope after tonight

1581
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:32,480
you will think differently

1582
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,480
because we told you to

1583
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,480
Taiwan's 5,000 Years

1584
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,480
before this

1585
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,480
Sponsor Wales

1586
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,480
he is a biologist

1587
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:53,480
He made a vain complement to the genes of the whole world

1588
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:55,480
what is his purpose

1589
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,480
he said

1590
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:00,480
we must know our own interests

1591
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,520
to fully realize who you are

1592
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:09,520
Only then can we grasp the choice of where to go in the future

1593
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:15,520
This is a little bit of what I have studied archeology over the years

1594
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,520
Accumulate all one perception

1595
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,520
available to you

1596
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,520
because

1597
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:26,520
Actually Taiwan is our home, right?

1598
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:31,040
As a Taiwanese, one cannot understand Taiwanese culture

1599
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:36,040
Even with great wealth, the heart is empty

1600
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:41,040
Nanke Medical Subgroup, Archaeological Research on Archaeological Medical Subgroup

1601
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:46,040
It is to provide us with an understanding of Taiwan's five thousand years of culture

1602
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:49,040
a platform for history

1603
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:52,040
Why?

1604
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,560
The foreground is in the National History Outline

1605
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:59,560
Give us another way of thinking

1606
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,220
Foreign nationals should have a little knowledge of their own history

1607
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:10,000
You Bi's Warmth and Tranquility to History

1608
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:13,500
No extreme nihilism

1609
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:19,300
When believing that foreign nationals can meet the above-mentioned conditions

1610
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,800
Taiwan has a future

1611
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,300
This is a little thought I want to offer you

1612
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,300
thank you

1613
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Thanks

1614
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
very well said

1615
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Talking about a thousand years is like talking about small things

1616
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
one afternoon before a family thing

1617
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Third sister

1618
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I want to do a little more questions

1619
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Ask their two keynote speakers and filmmakers

1620
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
is it starting now

1621
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
come on now start here

1622
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
ask Dr. Lee

1623
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,000
When did the name Taiwan start to be taken? Who took the name Taiwan?

1624
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I'll give it to you first, don't ask me

1625
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Dry warm, really

1626
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
When was Taiwan called Taiwan?

1627
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Taiwan this

1628
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Taiwan from a Historical Perspective

1629
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Or do you want to look at the name Taiwan

1630
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
The name Taiwan is actually

1631
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
very late

1632
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Taiwan does not know me

1633
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Not the whole island, where is Taiwan

1634
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Tainan, yes

1635
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
when was taiwan borrowed

1636
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
to cover the whole of Taiwan

1637
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,000
This is what we all have to think about

1638
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
This is one for all of us to think about

1639
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Taiwan is not called Taiwan

1640
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Dayuan

1641
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Also called burying the injustice

1642
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Taiwan

1643
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
What are you talking about?

1644
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,440
Taiwan is guilty

1645
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,480
yes i just tell you this

1646
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,480
The rest you go to Google

1647
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:13,480
yes

1648
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,480
Now that we are doing it, everyone wants to study Taiwan

1649
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,980
Experts from this research bureau in Taiwan

1650
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:27,480
I saw the news in the newspaper not long ago

1651
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:29,480
I want you to give me an answer

1652
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:34,480
That is to say, at that time, there were reports in the newspaper that in Indonesia

1653
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:37,480
found one very well there

1654
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:38,480
row there

1655
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,480
That is to say, about one meter

1656
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:43,480
that dampens the hobbit

1657
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:45,480
then i was thinking

1658
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:48,480
That is to say, our Lin Zhuyin has a machine called platooning machine.

1659
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:51,480
That is, Lin Zhuyin has a series called platooning machine

1660
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:53,480
That means he is a platoon machine

1661
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,480
Maybe it means he tracked down the assembly

1662
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,480
and is a

1663
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,480
or at least touched

1664
01:28:58,480 --> 01:28:59,480
Such a rowdy person

1665
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I don't know if it's the element

1666
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,900
with this

1667
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:06,900
You say indonesia they hobbies won what's the relationship

1668
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:11,900
very good

1669
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,900
Hahaha

1670
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:17,700
Because I brought several copies today

1671
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,900
Can't go home yet

1672
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:22,900
So I'll give you that first

1673
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,900
The Poet of the Fowles

1674
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:26,900
The Poet of the Fowles

1675
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:28,900
not that

1676
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:31,900
The real Hobbies because he was made into a movie

1677
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,900
That's why I call him Hobbies

1678
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:34,900
OK

1679
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:35,900
good

1680
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:38,900
It was actually different in those days

1681
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:41,900
The Hobbies should now be the Fowl poet

1682
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,900
The Dating I have now

1683
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:46,900
The current date seems to be more than 40,000 years.

1684
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:48,900
Zhang Xian

1685
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:50,900
even earlier

1686
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:53,900
So this is what we call these

1687
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:56,900
The so-called short blacks are all together

1688
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:57,900
talk

1689
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:58,900
I

1690
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I will tell you an experience

1691
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
once

1692
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
that is

1693
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Because at that time it seemed that

1694
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
That female Vice President Li Xiulian?

1695
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
So when I'm sure

1696
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
That's exactly what he posted

1697
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
sea ​​black person's question

1698
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
The one at the pit management in Hengchun

1699
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Liao's Liao's

1700
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Are there any sea blacks here?

1701
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
speak faster faster

1702
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
That's hard to do

1703
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Change to the opportunity to go online

1704
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
This is called reporting

1705
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
can you make a name

1706
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
this is one

1707
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
I can't find any evidence so far

1708
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
we say this

1709
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
you want to talk about sea black

1710
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
only one meter

1711
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
at least we have to say

1712
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
is he a child

1713
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Are you still an adult?

1714
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
right

1715
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
But this figure actually has his range

1716
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
But the real so-called dwarfs

1717
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:13,000
So far there is no such substantive evidence in Taiwan

1718
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Then you say this dwarf skill

1719
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Does it have anything to do with these dwarfs?

1720
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
We said that there are short blacks in the Philippines

1721
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Wait a minute, maybe Mr. Zhang

1722
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Mr. Zhang did this archaeology in the Philippines

1723
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
they have actual evidence of this

1724
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,000
So far, there is no such evidence in Taiwan

1725
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
OK

1726
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I think this question is actually pretty good.

1727
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Because dwarfs actually have dwarf skills

1728
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I think that Academician Li just now

1729
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Where is Academician Li Renguo?

1730
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,000
He has written articles

1731
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Talking about the short black people in Taiwan

1732
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
But mainly from the legend

1733
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
There are many tribes with legends about dwarfs

1734
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Are there any dwarfs?

1735
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
In fact, in the past

1736
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Someone recently told me

1737
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I don't know if it's true or not

1738
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
He said I'll tell you a secret

1739
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
He said there is a place to keep secret now

1740
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Also punish the short black man like this

1741
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I said where is it?

1742
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
He won't talk

1743
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
don't speak

1744
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
But I can tell you

1745
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Now there are some clues

1746
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
clue

1747
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
What about the little black man?

1748
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
In fact, in Southeast Asia

1749
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
is the branch of Malaysia

1750
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
the Philippines

1751
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
The three should be universal

1752
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
that this

1753
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Do you have this in Taiwan?

1754
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Then recently we were

1755
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Eight Immortals Cave

1756
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
It is the ruins of the Eight Immortals Cave in Taitung

1757
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
layer we found

1758
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
About 5,000 to 6,000 years ago

1759
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
this level of culture

1760
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
So the Nagahama culture that Han just talked about

1761
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
The one tens of thousands of years earlier

1762
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
there is one in the middle

1763
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
There is an interval in the middle of more than 10,000 years

1764
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
what about these things

1765
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
it is also

1766
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
very simple times

1767
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
so very this this

1768
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
nor any naughtiness

1769
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Nor is there any such sign of agriculture

1770
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
but we think

1771
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
it does have

1772
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,600
people on this level exist

1773
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:04,000
Is it possible that this layer of people is a short black man?

1774
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:06,200
So far we haven't found any human bones

1775
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,300
But from his cultural layer exists

1776
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,100
The world of five or six thousand years looks like

1777
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:14,000
and his periods are very similar to those of the Filipinos

1778
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,900
So we can only speculate

1779
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,600
he may be a dwarf

1780
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:19,800
what about this part

1781
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:22,200
We hope that in the future there will be more and more evidence

1782
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,100
In fact, archeology is to slowly test

1783
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,800
Accumulation of data bit by bit

1784
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,200
Well, now there are some clues

1785
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,200
I believe that in the future this matter may

1786
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:33,100
There must be a way to make it clear one day

1787
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,000
i think this is there

1788
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,900
So as for the Flourish just now

1789
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,900
It's this Hobby stuff

1790
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:42,200
Well, there are many different theories in this past

1791
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:44,000
Some people think this may be modern man

1792
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,800
he's just sick

1793
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,400
so he is short

1794
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,400
about one meter high

1795
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:52,600
Then the capacity is about 350 cm

1796
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,000
Just 350CC

1797
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:56,300
Now our people are 1300CC

1798
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,000
Of course people now

1799
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:59,700
Then they only have 350CC

1800
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,280
Why are there such small people?

1801
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,680
So many people thought it was a kind of modern man

1802
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,720
because he is very late

1803
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:05,840
just ten thousand years

1804
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:06,640
is sick

1805
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:07,840
But recent new research

1806
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,640
Already pushed back the age

1807
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:10,960
think he is not modern

1808
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,480
he may be an older

1809
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,760
Homo erectus

1810
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,040
only in Southeast Asia

1811
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:17,840
gradually affected by the environment

1812
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:18,960
after isolation

1813
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,960
Will stay on this Flourish island

1814
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:23,320
So the problem is not solved yet

1815
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:25,600
There are still a lot of political discussions

1816
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,760
But it's always getting brighter

1817
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,360
Now more and more evidence

1818
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,680
Including a mathematical genetic evidence

1819
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,760
Evidence that includes these cultural medicines

1820
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,160
Wait so we can learn more about it

1821
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:37,880
So this so-called Flourish Men

1822
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,120
what is going on

1823
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,000
welcome

1824
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Thanks

1825
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:41,600
Come

1826
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:42,920
we are grateful

1827
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:44,360
Okay, thank you

1828
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:45,360
Thanks

1829
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:49,600
I am very grateful to Huang Mu Yuanchang this time

1830
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,800
give me a chance to welcome

1831
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,040
I am a researcher at the Central Domestic Research Institute

1832
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:54,720
Hong Deqian

1833
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:58,320
First of all, I would also like to thank Zhang Yanshi and Teacher Li

1834
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:59,720
so wonderful

1835
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,000
It's also very humorous, so the whole process will be very lively

1836
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I personally also thank a lot

1837
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Then I raised my hand mainly to see if I could get Mr. Liao

1838
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,000
go home

1839
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,000
a little scared

1840
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Then I just tell a little story

1841
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I went to Willingdon, New Zealand in 1999 to attend a conference

1842
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Then from the airport to the hotel where you leave

1843
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
just hitchhike

1844
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Then cut the car driver to look like the name of the show

1845
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
He also looked at me

1846
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
then suddenly asked me

1847
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:48,000
It seems that our competition is spiritually a little painful

1848
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
He asked me if you are from Taiwan

1849
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
I said yes

1850
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
He said that our ancestors

1851
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
seems to have a common ancestor

1852
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
He said they have a heart

1853
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,620
Since, as in 1999,

1854
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:06,700
that is to say at that time

1855
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:10,960
Formal recognition of Māori ancestry may have come from Taiwan

1856
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,800
So I just answer him

1857
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:16,160
say we are brothers

1858
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:19,300
So let me feel at ease even when I'm bullying others

1859
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:21,800
because abroad

1860
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:25,040
First time to New Zealand

1861
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,160
then i was curious

1862
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:30,520
So three or four thousand years ago

1863
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:33,200
How can there be a way to cross the ocean from Taiwan

1864
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:36,400
as far as new zealand

1865
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:40,320
Then wait until I visit their Rijksmuseum

1866
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:41,920
large-scale visitor

1867
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:47,460
because he has two canoes

1868
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:49,920
That canoe has planks in the middle

1869
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:54,100
And there are bamboo poles at the front and back to tie it up

1870
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,260
So in the middle it can be

1871
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:57,300
Can be horizontal

1872
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:59,500
That is to say, traffic is also possible

1873
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,100
because of this

1874
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Only in this way is there a way to save the coolness

1875
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
So I feel very cooperative

1876
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
also very active

1877
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Taiwan's coastal people crossed the sea beautifully so early

1878
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Then in Australia there is a kind of tango

1879
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I heard that it is also native to Taiwan.

1880
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
their present archaeological DNA finds

1881
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:27,000
It may have passed through Australia and then chased to Newia

1882
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
So many people in Newia like to translate

1883
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,000
This is very similar to the Yan Zhuwen in Taiwan

1884
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
so i have a suggestion

1885
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:43,000
That is to say, Newcia itself is kinder

1886
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:49,000
He has a good reservation about Maori culture and chairs

1887
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,000
So our Zhuang Yan also has forty-one poems

1888
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:58,000
should put this like this blue co chair

1889
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Because this Lan Ke chair is more than ten years old

1890
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Is a national security officer of Taiwan

1891
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Good things should be shared with this country

1892
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Therefore, cooperation should be strengthened

1893
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Matsu

1894
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Taiwan Matsu should be present

1895
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Thank you for the above

1896
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Thanks

1897
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
thanks for your question

1898
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
but i tell you

1899
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
i have the same experience

1900
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I am here

1901
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I forgot what year it is now

1902
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
There is a man named Force Leach

1903
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
He specializes in fish

1904
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
he told me

1905
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:40,000
He said the profiteers were probably from your Amis

1906
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
good

1907
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I don't care

1908
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
I said I don't know

1909
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
but he came to me

1910
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
He especially ran to Taiwan

1911
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
because he went to hawaii

1912
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,000
I heard I have a lot of fish in my hand

1913
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
what fish

1914
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
variety of these fish

1915
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Especially the ghost knife

1916
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:06,400
Because he thought there was a group of people chasing ghost swords

1917
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:12,000
from Taiwan all the way to New Zealand

1918
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:17,000
You believe it or you don't believe it

1919
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Believers, Hengxin, but I want to tell you

1920
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,200
Peter Biaogu he thinks so too

1921
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:29,900
He said that this group of people went out five thousand years ago

1922
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:31,900
chasing ghost knife

1923
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:38,900
I said you also want to eat fish, are you eating fish?

1924
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:40,900
where did ghost head knife come from

1925
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:43,900
Do you know this biological chain?

1926
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:47,900
Do you know this flying fish medicine?

1927
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:51,900
When does flying fish medicine start

1928
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:57,900
The ghost knife came after the flying fish

1929
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:59,900
so i am

1930
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
And Lambi what will I see?

1931
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:07,000
The ghost head knife that started with the useless fish is here

1932
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:08,500
Ghost head knife is here

1933
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
what came from

1934
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
fish name

1935
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
what fish name

1936
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
please give me this room

1937
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I'll give you one

1938
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,500
your jokes are funny

1939
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,500
let everyone have a copy

1940
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,500
After the ghost head knife comes, it will be a fin fish

1941
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
fin fish

1942
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Hengchun's most famous

1943
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Broken Fish Umbrella

1944
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:40,000
This is a biological store

1945
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
good

1946
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
But what is this?

1947
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
go from south to north

1948
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Who is coming to the south?

1949
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,000
everytime i talk to japanese

1950
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
my very good

1951
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
he passed away last year

1952
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
everytime i go to japan

1953
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
i will

1954
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,740
what would i bring mullet roe for him

1955
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:06,740
mullet roe

1956
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:10,740
Mullet roe, everyone knows mullet roe

1957
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:14,240
Mullet roe, especially men like to eat it

1958
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:15,440
But it's better not to eat

1959
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:17,440
Vice President Wang, you must not eat

1960
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:20,440
good

1961
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:24,440
when will the mullet come

1962
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:27,440
everyone is right

1963
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:29,440
Everyone has an idea, right?

1964
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:32,940
what was it like when you were young

1965
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:34,940
The mullet will come

1966
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:37,940
The mullet will grow soft only in Taiwan

1967
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:41,240
That's why there are so many mullet roe in Taiwan

1968
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:42,740
what is this?

1969
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:44,740
gift from god

1970
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:46,740
yes

1971
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:49,640
So this is what I'm trying to say

1972
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:54,140
How did the coming and going of the crowd happen?

1973
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:56,940
In fact, here in Taiwan

1974
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,940
I will also tell you

1975
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:00,180
I just returned

1976
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I have no special instructions for you

1977
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
5000, 4000, 3000, 2000

1978
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:10,000
These people who live in these Nanke Park in Tainan

1979
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:15,000
not the continuation of their lives

1980
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,000
not a continuation of biological life

1981
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Can you understand this sentence

1982
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Each varies between 5,000 and 4,000 years

1983
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
this group of people left

1984
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Like the one we saw 7 meters down

1985
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
it just broke

1986
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
it's gone

1987
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Another place for another 4,000 years

1988
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Its chair is called Youxianfang Chair

1989
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
You Xianfang chair we saw

1990
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
4000 years ago

1991
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
2000 years ago

1992
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
not 3000 years ago

1993
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
what is explained here

1994
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Humans choose the one above the living environment

1995
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Commonality

1996
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:06,260
Three thousand years ago, it was the one with the highest distribution density in the entire Nanke Park

1997
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:11,460
Where did this group of people come from? Actually we are still chasing

1998
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:15,620
This is what I have been doing with Mr. Zhang for so many years.

1999
01:43:15,620 --> 01:43:19,420
He let me have a lot of space for these studies

2000
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:27,580
The ecological legacy of our material culture from mischievous, stony assortments

2001
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:31,500
What we want to chase is no matter where he comes from

2002
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:34,120
But when he lived in this place

2003
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:36,740
How do they adapt to this environment

2004
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:39,540
This is what we really want to pursue

2005
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:43,500
live here live well or not

2006
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:44,980
i want to tell you

2007
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:47,660
If what Golanby over there told me was

2008
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:52,860
More than 85% of the time when eating the same type of shellfish

2009
01:43:52,860 --> 01:43:54,460
good or bad

2010
01:43:55,420 --> 01:43:56,980
definitely not good

2011
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:57,700
right

2012
01:43:57,700 --> 01:44:00,300
This is what I was able to from the archaeological site

2013
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:08,600
Being able to discover how it behaves on a strategy that keeps them sustainable

2014
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:15,440
Yeah, that's what I've been wanting to share with you all.

2015
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:21,740
We chased from inside the archaeological site to the end guys.

2016
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:28,160
If you just want to chase who it is

2017
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:37,000
One day I got a copy, it seems my wife gave it to me

2018
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
的DNA

2019
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:50,000
A test of DNA Now the technology of DNA testing, you can know it by spitting

2020
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:56,000
how many kinds of people do you have

2021
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Turns out their first test was

2022
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:13,000
The French must scold the Germans to death, they are so dirty, or something, between each other's workshops, but after a week, they found out that they were still Cutten and the Brothers.

2023
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:31,000
In my age, Shi Xiaorong, do you know? Shi Xiaorong, when we met on the high-speed rail once, you come to study who I am?

2024
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:40,000
He himself told me that 1/16 of me is Han Chinese, and I am indeed, you can ask him.

2025
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:46,000
He said so and so and so and so, how.

2026
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:59,000
So who am I to say that you are? I am patriarchal. Who are the people left in your agreement? It doesn't matter, if you live here, you agree with this place, you agree with this place.

2027
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,680
Agree with this place, this is the attitude that matters

2028
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:07,840
This is what I want to share with you

2029
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,840
still come, sorry

2030
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:11,840
there are people

2031
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,340
i want to ask

2032
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:14,840
Ask Professor Li

2033
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:19,940
just inside the archaeological sawdust

2034
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:26,180
A few of them are thorn slices or peach slices

2035
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:29,180
That's the blade

2036
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:30,620
what culture is that

2037
01:46:30,620 --> 01:46:32,620
Niaosong culture

2038
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:34,620
bird pine iron

2039
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:36,620
That's the pavement and that's

2040
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:38,620
not tile

2041
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:40,620
Lay out

2042
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:41,620
Slab

2043
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:42,620
tile or

2044
01:46:42,620 --> 01:46:43,620
Slab

2045
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:44,620
Is it paving or

2046
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:45,620
Slab

2047
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:46,620
I can't see clearly

2048
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:47,620
is a tile

2049
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:49,620
what does that do

2050
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:53,620
like a floor covering

2051
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:55,120
what is it like in culture

2052
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:58,560
Niaosong culture as we know it now

2053
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,100
I said where did it come from, right?

2054
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:04,600
Haruya

2055
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:06,600
Ha ha ha ha

2056
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,400
You say that culture is from

2057
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:10,400
that culture

2058
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:14,400
That culture at that time was the Niaosong culture

2059
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:17,400
iron age bird pine

2060
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,400
The second question to ask you

2061
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:25,000
Dr. Lee, you just said that you are 1/16 Taiwanese

2062
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,200
Nah

2063
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:27,200
Shi Xialong

2064
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:30,200
Teacher, you didn't listen to what you said

2065
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:34,200
Then what is your 15/16?

2066
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:35,200
I'm not me

2067
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,200
It's Shixialong

2068
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:37,200
Shi Xialong

2069
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:40,200
Shi Xialong sings famous songs

2070
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,200
sing a famous song

2071
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:43,200
Taiwanese physical education teacher

2072
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:45,200
He is a physical education teacher at the Normal University

2073
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:47,200
1 in 16 Taiwanese

2074
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:50,200
1 out of 16 Koreans

2075
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:51,200
No la

2076
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:52,200
he means to say

2077
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:55,200
He's in one of his syndicates

2078
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:56,200
There are different

2079
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:58,200
as if i'm going to tell you guys

2080
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:00,200
I am 2006 07

2081
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,800
Go to America this year, go to Four Brite in America

2082
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:07,960
In our office there is a sister who is tall and burly

2083
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:09,440
bright girl

2084
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:12,960
After I finished speaking, he said I have Shuffle Shape

2085
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:17,400
That is, there is a model behind your front teeth

2086
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:19,520
We call it model incisors

2087
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,200
What is a model incisor?

2088
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:24,360
Model incisors are a feature of Mongolia

2089
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:28,400
Everyone, you will definitely look in the mirror when you go back.

2090
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,400
There will be model incisors

2091
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:34,960
This Mr. Zhang even wrote the article on the front teeth of the model

2092
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:37,480
good

2093
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:40,520
He is from Central and South America

2094
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:41,760
He said I have it too

2095
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,400
he has too

2096
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:45,600
Model incisors

2097
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:48,200
Then I said how could you have

2098
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:52,040
I go out mother Japanese

2099
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:53,360
yes

2100
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:54,720
so this is

2101
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:58,240
We are in every human biological life

2102
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,240
you probably are

2103
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:06,400
Because your genes are likely to be in a certain person

2104
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:11,200
But how come you don't matter

2105
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:13,600
i still turn around

2106
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:16,000
it doesn't matter what kind of person you are

2107
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:21,200
When you live in Taiwan and you identify with Taiwan

2108
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:23,800
this is important

2109
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:25,800
OK

2110
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,800
Thanks

2111
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:29,800
Excuse me

2112
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:32,500
your article first

2113
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:34,000
your question first

2114
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
you have a lot of questions

2115
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,400
your speech was wonderful

2116
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:37,800
I am a foreigner

2117
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:38,900
i want to ask a question

2118
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:40,840
It's because you just broke a bag

2119
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:44,600
That is to say, there are many points made of carbon stone mountains

2120
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:47,100
Is it all your carbon car

2121
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:48,300
the point of the chair

2122
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:50,400
Then do the carbon stone mountain one

2123
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,400
A point that is not a chair is a chair

2124
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:56,100
the back shell of a chair

2125
01:49:56,100 --> 01:50:00,100
the sample taken

2126
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,500
the one to do

2127
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:05,640
Let's talk about the development of the same number

2128
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:06,940
that that

2129
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:09,440
because you said five thousand years

2130
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:11,840
I think it used to be

2131
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,240
It's like carbon dating

2132
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:17,540
I don't know the degree of certainty of your year

2133
01:50:17,540 --> 01:50:19,840
Is it possible to use carbon to do it?

2134
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:20,480
that is to say you

2135
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:21,740
yes yes

2136
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:23,080
This has

2137
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:26,480
This we send a different lab

2138
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,080
We send to different labs

2139
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:28,960
with beta

2140
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:30,460
also send beta

2141
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:31,860
now present

2142
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:36,460
National Taiwan University has a linear accelerator

2143
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:37,360
before him

2144
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:39,260
We also use the traditional

2145
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:42,360
Liu Songgui's Teacher Liu helped us make it

2146
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:45,060
So what was done five thousand years ago

2147
01:50:45,060 --> 01:50:47,260
is actually more specific

2148
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:50,280
We are now four thousand two to four thousand eight

2149
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:52,220
four thousand two to four thousand eight

2150
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:53,280
we are just

2151
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:56,880
Humblendon's take it five thousand years

2152
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:57,480
OK

2153
01:50:57,480 --> 01:51:00,080
general anthropology and archeology

2154
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,840
They are worried that in this era of colonial

2155
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:06,240
used by imperialism

2156
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:09,080
That is to say, have you ever considered this problem?

2157
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:11,520
That is to say, will it be possible?

2158
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:15,360
It's just like this, that's colonial

2159
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:18,520
This amperiorism this relationship

2160
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:22,760
This is the right and wrong place of the position

2161
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:24,320
i want to tell you

2162
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:28,000
I used to talk to Xu Zhongwen and Teacher Xu

2163
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:30,840
Everyone knows Xu Zhongwen and Mr. Xu

2164
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:32,520
I had a talk with him

2165
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:33,760
I said I privately

2166
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:36,040
Now record it and turn it off

2167
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,480
I said

2168
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:44,760
Taiwan is a pirate economy

2169
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:47,680
pirate economy

2170
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:50,920
Surely economists disagree with me

2171
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:54,440
Pirate economy is

2172
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:59,160
be more transparent

2173
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:00,000
that is

2174
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,420
I'm here, I'll leave after I'm done catching

2175
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:14,520
Nobody thinks of this place as the place where I'm going to live here for generations

2176
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:17,720
I just told him I said

2177
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:25,360
Hey, Nanke has been here for 5,000 years and left, and the one for 4,000 years has come and left

2178
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:29,880
We all regard this group of people as the first inhabitants of Taiwan

2179
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:33,960
But are these people from the same group?

2180
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:41,560
i tell you privately

2181
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:49,240
yes, they are all passers-by

2182
01:52:55,360 --> 01:53:00,080
Excuse me, if you want the woman of 5,000 years, you will come here after 4,000 years

2183
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Have they tested you for BNO?

2184
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
No

2185
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,000
I'm sorry, we are now talking about Mr. Zhang

2186
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
we did it but it ain't out yet

2187
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
or we can't do it

2188
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Don't get me wrong, it's not that we can't do it

2189
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
yes we can't do it

2190
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,000
We have done a lot, just to test

2191
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,000
We also sent these specimens to Germany

2192
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
called MACPRAC

2193
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,000
The best organization in the world to make this DNA

2194
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
We put the mark down, it can't make it

2195
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Why? Not its experimental parallax

2196
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
because it is a top

2197
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Because our preservation environment in Taiwan is too poor

2198
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Because of the DNA that exists in that bone

2199
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
these things are gone

2200
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
So it can't be pulled out, so it can't be made

2201
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Then this, if the storage environment is good, there is no problem

2202
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Like we were recently, our colleagues are on Liang Island in Matsu

2203
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Look at him for eight thousand years

2204
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
He also sent the laboratory

2205
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,000
He can do it inside

2206
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Because of the quantity-guided human stock?

2207
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
It's inside this shell

2208
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
So shells have a natural

2209
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,000
can be a function of preservation

2210
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Because it's all that stuffy stuff

2211
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
So it can also save

2212
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
its these

2213
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
These can be done with DNA

2214
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
these things come out

2215
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
But our Nanke stuff

2216
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
did much

2217
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
In Taiwan, we also do Taiwan Majie Hospital

2218
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Then send it to Bucks Plank in Germany

2219
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,000
can't do it

2220
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
now there is a hope

2221
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,000
we send to ireland

2222
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
a lab in ireland

2223
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
It is specialized in ear bones

2224
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
the bone inside the ear

2225
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Then this bone is wrapped in the head

2226
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
maybe it will be better

2227
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,000
and won't

2228
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Will not be affected by the outside environment

2229
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
So now we have a batch of specimens

2230
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
currently doing

2231
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
We hope to get a result

2232
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
maybe there is one

2233
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
amazing discovery

2234
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
don't seem to know

2235
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
the last one

2236
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,000
then this one

2237
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
two more questions

2238
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,000
please teach me

2239
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,020
Teeth are very important to our life

2240
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:05,740
If we're missing teeth, find a way to get implants, right?

2241
01:55:05,740 --> 01:55:08,640
Why did Yan Zhiwenming pull out his teeth?

2242
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:10,240
what do they mean

2243
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:12,520
or why do they think this way

2244
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:17,400
He seems to have pulled out the left and right teeth of the front teeth

2245
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:20,020
Why is there such absorption

2246
01:55:20,020 --> 01:55:21,740
Please advise, thank you

2247
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:26,940
Thank you, this is because I still have two copies, hurry up and get one copy for each person

2248
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:27,860
this heavy

2249
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:29,860
I want to know more about Nanke

2250
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:32,620
It's okay, you come with me

2251
01:55:32,620 --> 01:55:37,100
That tooth extraction is, this is what we are talking about

2252
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:41,220
A Cultural Trait of the Someshima Uzu

2253
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:45,200
According to our current understanding

2254
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:49,380
it's a symbol of a rite of passage

2255
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:54,960
But in our cognition of five thousand years ago

2256
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:58,160
Five thousand years ago, both men and women

2257
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:00,160
But to compare

2258
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Let's say most of this Iron Age happens only to women

2259
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:11,000
And women we see now are called mature years

2260
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:15,000
That is to say, it will be at least 16 years old

2261
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Occurs after age 16

2262
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Let's talk about the size they drew. It is the side door size and the full size.

2263
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,000
And only pull the top but not the bottom

2264
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:32,000
This is a cultural characteristic of the Yu people in South Island

2265
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Thanks

2266
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Thank you two teachers for their wonderful speeches

2267
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:41,000
What I want to ask is that there are a lot of naughty people in today's information

2268
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:46,000
They do these naughty things to say that everyone can almost do it

2269
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Or is it that they have a dedicated group of people who keep the technique of being naughty?

2270
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
then maybe better

2271
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Then even do trade or say there is actually no

2272
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Naka didn't mention this

2273
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
so i'm pretty good

2274
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Thanks

2275
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,800
That's a great question we've also done

2276
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:08,360
With Mr. Chen Wenshan, we have worked together from five thousand years, four thousand years, three thousand years

2277
01:57:09,460 --> 01:57:15,140
Different from the analysis of these components above

2278
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:18,940
We especially do the so-called speech

2279
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:25,840
It is a component of a stone in a river in your place

2280
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:28,680
Let's understand if it's local

2281
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:30,920
Or from outside

2282
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:37,320
We do see a different phenomenon

2283
01:57:37,820 --> 01:57:41,280
For example, 5,000 years ago, 4,000 years ago, and 3,000 years ago

2284
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:43,720
There is this difference between the north and the south

2285
01:57:44,020 --> 01:57:50,420
Even we now think that the place 5,000 years ago belonged to this Penghu

2286
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:57,120
Or it is likely to be where the ingredient on the other side is located.

2287
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:59,960
Because we have seen the so-called

2288
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,560
Not in this place in Tainan

2289
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:06,480
For example, this burnt black

2290
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:09,360
Part of the burnt black part belongs to the local

2291
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:10,680
belonging to the local

2292
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:15,640
But it has some ingredients that belong to the Zhuoshui River

2293
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:20,760
From a face on the other side of Zhuoshui River and Dadu River

2294
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:24,200
So this is not a specialization

2295
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:26,200
we have now

2296
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:30,640
I'm not doing it later

2297
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:32,640
so-called specialization

2298
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:36,800
Or a phenomenon of the so-called logistics

2299
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:40,880
Well, we can't see this right now.

2300
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:43,720
answer you very specifically

2301
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:44,400
OK

2302
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,400
Okay, thank you

2303
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:47,040
Zhang Tianshi in the last two minutes

2304
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,480
there is none left

2305
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,640
no more no more

2306
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:51,640
two minutes

2307
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:53,080
last question

2308
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:54,560
because you have been there many times

2309
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:55,440
he has been there many times

2310
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:56,160
do a lot

2311
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:58,160
you have been there many times

2312
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,420
Excuse me, I have doubts because I have been watching that

2313
01:59:03,420 --> 01:59:07,100
Is it because archaeological photos always dig squares?

2314
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:09,100
I know squares are for positioning

2315
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:13,000
Then you just dig over there to know where the stuff came from.

2316
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,620
Then I have always had a doubt about the line in the middle of the grid.

2317
01:59:15,620 --> 01:59:18,300
That is also a place to walk and a dividing point

2318
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:19,300
if there is

2319
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:24,100
Will there be any ruins? The relics are buried under that pavilion line.

2320
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:25,900
how to find out

2321
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:28,400
To avoid is to have loaded things being moved

2322
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:29,400
Thanks

2323
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:31,900
I'm going to study next semester

2324
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:33,900
Ha ha ha ha

2325
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:36,900
This to Cucumber or to that

2326
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:38,900
ok come on good question

2327
01:59:38,900 --> 01:59:42,900
come to this square

2328
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:46,900
If the results of our experiments are theoretically

2329
01:59:46,900 --> 01:59:49,400
2x2 2 meters by 2 meters

2330
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:52,900
This means that the two of you are working inside

2331
01:59:52,900 --> 02:00:00,400
3 to 4 is the most cost-effective one

2332
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,520
not just positioning

2333
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:05,040
Positioning means that we have this square

2334
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:07,200
Everything comes out of this

2335
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:10,160
We put it away layer by layer

2336
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:15,600
is to tell us the up and down of these things

2337
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:19,720
The positions of these relationships in space cannot be mixed up

2338
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:22,240
But there is a line

2339
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:24,480
you see the line

2340
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:26,560
That is what we call borrowing strength

2341
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:29,840
A method of excavating an early tradition

2342
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:33,200
at the end you have something inside

2343
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:38,280
It's like a person's upper body is in

2344
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:41,680
The lower body in the carbon pit is in the middle of the divider

2345
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:44,080
then i will cut it off

2346
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:45,880
grab it

2347
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:48,320
kill

2348
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:51,400
spank all the way to that

2349
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:53,000
is not possible

2350
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,480
But now there are so-called

2351
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:56,960
One of our excavations in Nanke

2352
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:58,840
the whole compartment

2353
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:00,120
no middle no bit

2354
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:05,920
But we jumped and dug. If there is a phenomenon in the middle, we have to dig a hole.

2355
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:09,600
In the end, there will be a flat phenomenon

2356
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:11,840
different from mainland China

2357
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,920
When we talk to them in mainland China

2358
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:16,160
He said your kind of digging children

2359
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:20,960
When we dig 10 meters, we call it 10 meters

2360
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:24,160
They are called Dafang Carbon Fang

2361
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:25,280
yes

2362
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:29,000
Then this is a different way of excavation

2363
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:30,440
it's different in america

2364
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:37,160
What we do in the United States is not changed at all

2365
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:40,840
You just take one of your phenomena

2366
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:43,560
But between layers

2367
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:46,240
between this direction

2368
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:47,720
this is still important

2369
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:50,560
That means all of our unearthed stuff

2370
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:52,160
They all have their ID cards

2371
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:55,040
Otherwise, you can talk nonsense when the time comes

2372
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,880
Mix up the top with the bottom

2373
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,200
natural mix

2374
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:11,000
That is the one that got mixed up in the first place. If you mess with this side, then this is the most irrelevant thing. I can’t say that again.

2375
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:19,000
I suggest that you have the opportunity to host one and ask him for advice in private, because at 9:00

2376
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:26,000
The main team went to visit, you see his 5,000-year-old man is sleeping next to 200-year-old

2377
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:34,000
I feel that there is a lot of time. In Nanke and Tainan Science Park, there is no

2378
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Not yet, thank you two for their wonderful speeches, thank you for participating
