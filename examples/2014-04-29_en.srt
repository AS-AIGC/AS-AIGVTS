00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,980
teacher

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,780
I

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,700
Is

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,260
i miss

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,460
Our topic today is very delicate

17
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,540
Medical Imaging in the Age of Nimi

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,880
I think everyone is interested in medical imaging

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,380
between our normal lives

20
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,300
Everyone's X-rayed

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,240
Did you take an ultrasound, what did you take?

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,260
Today we have no speakers

23
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,740
Gu Yu Guangyan

24
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,260
He's a researcher at our nursing home

25
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,920
His research on video is many years

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,760
He is going to take an X-ray image today

27
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,520
But his X-ray images

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,600
It is higher resolution than the X-ray images we usually go to the hospital to take

29
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,260
Very, very much, so it's called Naimi

30
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,720
He'll let us know how good his resolution is then

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,160
And it's a 3D space

32
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,620
Then introduce our keynote speaker today

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,640
Dr. Hu joined the Academia Sinica in 1992

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,840
So I'm still two years old

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,200
He is the physics department of National Taiwan University

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,760
Graduated in 1982

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,160
Then in Connecta and Wisconsin in the United States

38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,280
Ph.D.

39
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,640
Then he was actually doing his Ph.D.

40
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,080
synchrotron radiation

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,000
Let me introduce Taiwan by the way

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,040
There is also a nice synchrotron radiation

43
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,680
facilities in Hsinchu

44
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,720
this is who we do the research on

45
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,680
very lucky place

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,160
Dr. Hu used the synchrotron radiation in Hsinchu

47
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,920
I believe he has a lot of images today

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,160
Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Hsinchu

49
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,660
Of course, in terms of synchrotron radiation

50
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,360
There are many facilities in the world

51
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,080
So Dr. Hu is everywhere

52
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,560
Go to Europe and America

53
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,720
Many places are his experimental sites

54
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,640
Then he probably

55
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,400
I don't know what to say in detail

56
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,320
However, it can be seen from the title

57
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,960
sometimes he tells us today

58
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,160
what technique does he use

59
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,600
Can make an image very clear

60
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,320
Then he did research recently

61
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,920
Also do some biological in vivo

62
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,920
It's just some images of the living body

63
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,220
I don't know if he will give me today

64
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,660
his research work

65
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,880
It is also very prominent in this

66
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,520
then i talk nonsense

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So let Dr. Hu begin

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Thank you Vice President

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The vice president is memorized by our teacher

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
so we are happy today

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He said he was a freshman at Academia Sinica and had just arrived

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
with him in the hospital

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He said we are happy today

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I was introduced by Teacher Wang

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
At the same time, I also thank you very much

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
listen at this dinner time

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
When I was next to this TOM

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
In fact, I didn't think about it at all.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I think it is

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Later I saw this barrier

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I find again

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
so i put my 101 suit

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Where can I find hope

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Everyone will feel better

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
ok good

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Then what my teacher Wang said just now is

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I probably will today

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I will talk a little bit

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
look at everyone's time

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
OK

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
OK what I'm going to say is

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Methical Imaging

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Metical Imaging This is when I was going to talk about this

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I was thinking of saying I'm going to make my own stuff

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I will say X-ray microscopy

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
or

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But I happened to be in Europe at the time

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I used to be TeeSus Advisor

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll just talk to him, talk about a Public Talk

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And he's like, oops, he's going to give this talk to the public, science talk

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Speaking speeches, the simplest way to say eleven is that you tell them to make money

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The second is to take care of the body according to how they do

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I said make money, otherwise I can't teach

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Then I will talk about a topic related to taking care of the body.

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But what we're actually doing is classifying

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
A lot of what we have done in recent years is about Mechanical Research

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But how to take care of your body

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It doesn't really matter

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,080
put up business images

110
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,040
I think everyone will be interested

111
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,480
Another catch word

112
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,120
This is the fancy word

113
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,040
It's Nano

114
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,720
I think everyone has been nami

115
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,680
It's been bombing for ten years

116
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,880
So you probably want to say

117
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,520
What does Nano have to do with us?

118
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,520
I said for business

119
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,880
So I won't talk too much about business images today

120
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,240
I don't care about MRI stuff

121
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,920
Actually like now you are on Wikipedia

122
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,920
You can find many similar reports wherever you look.

123
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,920
So I think my main job today

124
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,680
Just to talk about the relationship between business images and Nano

125
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
Business images are of course important

126
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,280
I think I don't need to talk about this

127
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,200
So I gave a very simple

128
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,320
The first one is an important diagnostic tool

129
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,920
now you go to the hospital

130
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,360
especially in the last ten years

131
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,280
you go to the hospital

132
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,920
we say we don't know

133
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,120
Doctors hardly diagnose

134
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,840
if you have anything

135
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,920
Remember to queue you for all the tests when he goes in

136
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,040
after finishing

137
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,920
in the current doctor

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,080
many young doctors

139
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,520
you if he didn't do these things

140
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,080
I'm afraid he has no way to see the evidence.

141
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,120
It is also said

142
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,880
Now these advances in medical imaging

143
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,080
to a degree

144
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,000
so i'll talk a little bit later

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,040
S light here

146
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,160
I know better

147
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,520
some of his previous history

148
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,560
you will find

149
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,000
Actually so many of us are doing

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,080
It's not useless on weekdays

151
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,680
Today everyone can enjoy

152
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,280
This better medical care

153
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,360
With the development of this business image

154
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,600
has a great relationship

155
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,320
I am at this time

156
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,640
Let me talk about this topic first

157
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,280
This business video and unreasonable technology

158
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,240
what does it matter

159
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,040
this is

160
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,120
Let's say the first thing is to say

161
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,080
Due to the development of unreasonable technology

162
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,560
in business images

163
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,840
We have created new imaging principles

164
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,600
this i will talk about now

165
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,640
we can't do it now

166
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,240
go to particular example

167
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,160
But this is an important reason

168
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,440
It's because you have a future that is difficult to understand technology

169
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,400
Your previous imaging method

170
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,120
you can do it differently

171
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,400
you will get better

172
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,240
Then of course it means

173
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,080
Have better components and equipment

174
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,440
So parts of these

175
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,080
I'll ask again later

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,440
Research done by myself

177
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,300
i will tell you

178
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,100
you may use

179
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,340
I'll just say I use X-rays as an example

180
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,840
what do these things mean

181
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,340
OK

182
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,040
Why can technology be difficult

183
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,340
Why does this new imaging principle

184
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,140
And it can be used to make better original parts and equipment

185
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,540
but one important point

186
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,600
so it's like business

187
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,640
The most relevant is actually

188
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,400
first lead technique or called contrast technique

189
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,900
or calibration

190
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,640
The noun is not very uniform

191
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,740
but basically

192
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,500
It is how you use the extra substance

193
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,900
Make it this image imaging can do better

194
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,240
Well, that's why my main connection today is with Nelly.

195
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,800
In fact, it is on the Naili line

196
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,900
That is to say, for other biomedical images

197
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,700
Nai Li Xian Yin Ji

198
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,540
Why should it be

199
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,500
we need to use nelly

200
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,600
Don't use the traditional way

201
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,500
There must be a lot of different techniques

202
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,900
for different image formats

203
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,900
its important features

204
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,500
The first one is Nelly

205
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,740
The only reason for it is that its size is important

206
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,240
You need to be able to reach a reasonable size

207
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,280
then i want everyone to know

208
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,040
should now be the size

209
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,160
Everyone knows how small Naimi is

210
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,900
Nimi is 1000 times smaller than Pooh

211
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,440
Pooh is 1000 times smaller than Haomi

212
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,640
a very simple

213
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,600
The size of the gills that the human body perceives

214
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,440
It's actually Homi

215
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,740
homi's words

216
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,840
Pooh

217
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,800
Sorry

218
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,880
hehehehe

219
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,780
Ok

220
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,340
so your hair is

221
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,420
Micron is Haomi or

222
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,760
Oh ok

223
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,960
Hair is say 80micron

224
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,360
it's pooh

225
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,360
about

226
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,420
You can think of this Naimi

227
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,160
1000 times smaller than this

228
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,260
so i wait

229
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,900
we used to do a

230
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,300
one

231
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,400
Um

232
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,340
very short lead is given

233
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,000
Absolutely not

234
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,400
us

235
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,240
I am today when I was in Korea

236
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,840
At that time, South Korean President Oh Moo-hyun visited

237
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,140
the single track over there

238
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:48,940
That

239
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,240
They told our cooperation team

240
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,120
he only listens to one head

241
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,620
not three and a half

242
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,240
He said how do you tell him

243
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,220
so we talked

244
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,080
made a

245
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,780
This animation is easy to say

246
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,000
you shut it off from you

247
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,600
I keep seeing this space in the middle of you

248
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,000
how big is the gap

249
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
we start with a

250
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,280
From a human to mouse to mouse

251
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,840
This one organ mouse

252
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,540
How many cells are in an organ

253
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,700
how big is the cell

254
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,640
Then how many cells have

255
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,580
all the way down to the molecular structure

256
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,840
You know the scale of this

257
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,880
this difference in the middle

258
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,000
is very very large

259
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,880
So after looking at it like this

260
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
it just feels like

261
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,540
no good then what's the matter with you

262
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,640
or say for it under the microscope

263
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,640
You don't even realize how small it is

264
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,640
The other nano

265
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,640
It is the developer

266
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,640
The most important thing is probably to use particles

267
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,640
Or some of these particles from oil machines

268
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,640
its composition

269
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
is that I can use many different ways

270
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
let this one

271
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
Although a very small particle

272
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
It's probably hundreds of atoms

273
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
or thousands of atoms

274
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
But on top there will be different composition

275
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
And then there's the surface of it

276
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
That is to say when you were so young

277
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,640
its surface takes up its nature

278
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
very significant portion

279
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,640
So we say its surface modification

280
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
or surface this

281
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,600
This presentation will cause his characteristic

282
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,440
big difference

283
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,320
What does his nano-developer do?

284
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,720
Of course he can be the best first

285
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,360
Ability to Reconnect with Metabolism

286
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,480
means you can

287
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,840
The second is that you can exclude

288
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,920
because you want to say

289
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,800
You are going to have an MRI

290
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,520
Or when doing HRA

291
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,720
he will call you

292
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,840
So the video camera goes in

293
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,320
Then of course you hope he doesn't stay

294
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
because it's not a good thing

295
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,680
You certainly don't need to stay in the body

296
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,840
So his exclusion is also very important

297
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,640
and now say for example

298
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,920
you want to do functional development

299
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,640
is what I hope or is a manifestation of this molecule

300
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,320
what you wish you typed in

301
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,080
He will run where you want to grow

302
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,440
So the professionalism of his organization is also important

303
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,360
and now there is a trend

304
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,760
that is to say I now wish

305
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,040
No I can now use different mods

306
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,000
Now everyone's every mod has been done

307
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,120
The module is to image an MRI

308
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,480
Magnetic shock photos of SPAC positron and MRI

309
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,440
how do you put it together

310
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,640
you don't want to say

311
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,880
I get a shot while I do this

312
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,760
You sit and wait until after a few images

313
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,040
this person

314
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
almost

315
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So we hope that means

316
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is the best time

317
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Let this patient suffer less from this pain

318
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So it becomes an optical module imaging

319
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It is also an important nano-developer

320
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
the direction of this development

321
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
In fact, I think

322
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That is to say, nano developer

323
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
There is one most important Foundation

324
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
this is what we think

325
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
this is a cartoon

326
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
get it out

327
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
was supposed to explain

328
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It means this Tumor and this Angiogenesis

329
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Tumor is tumor

330
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
This is when a tumor grows

331
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Blood vessels will have

332
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
we will now

333
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm talking about a very important topic

334
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Is the senior of blood vessels

335
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
or neovascularization

336
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
when the tumor grows

337
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
this was long ago

338
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
twenty or thirty years ago

339
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
There was a doctor named Judah Fogman

340
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
he does open up

341
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The tumor he operated on

342
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
He found that the tumor

343
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
normal blood vessel density

344
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
will be much higher than normal tissue

345
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
his idea is to say

346
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Because these tumors are rapidly growing

347
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
he hopes

348
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
He wants to be able to have a lot of nutrients

349
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,320
oxygen to supply him

350
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,500
He grows up so fast

351
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,280
So he sent out a bunch of distress calls

352
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
call these blood vessels say

353
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,680
You send a tube now

354
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,080
oxygenate it

355
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,380
that's because of this

356
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,760
So it will cause our nanometer today

357
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,820
Whether this particle is used for treatment

358
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,720
Or to do a very important basis for visualization

359
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,160
today otherwise you can think about it

360
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,800
Why should I use nanoparticles

361
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,860
molecule of this drug

362
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,400
or molecular imaging agent

363
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,720
can do the same why

364
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,820
It's this specificity these could be better

365
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,620
Then I think the most important difference is the nanoparticles

366
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,520
it has this sex

367
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,220
That is to say, I treat my blood vessel as

368
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,600
I'll keep emphasizing later

369
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,500
this blood vessel it

370
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,340
The new blood vessels grow very broken

371
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,360
its structure is not very complete

372
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,660
So it becomes you now in the middle

373
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,400
This has particles in it

374
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,700
it will run out

375
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,140
In fact, you can be on the Internet

376
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,180
If you go to find this called EPR

377
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,840
Infactor

378
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,340
Enhanced Permeation and Retention

379
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,900
give it to improve its penetration

380
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,120
Follow up function

381
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,360
have it this blood vessel

382
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,640
particle This particle will run out

383
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,040
you know after running out

384
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,880
Particles are not the same as this molecule

385
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,120
It stays there after running out

386
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,040
It's not easy to come back smoothly

387
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,920
So at this point you can

388
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
we have many studies

389
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,200
you can see it turn

390
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,640
After putting this thing in

391
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,320
its in you if you have a tumor

392
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,520
The blood vessels over there are very broken.

393
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,320
been leaking

394
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,840
like you want to turn on a faucet

395
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,040
There's a leak all over you

396
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,680
it just keeps leaking

397
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,640
There will be a lot of water at the end

398
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,000
So this can be done

399
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,800
This tumor-resistant drug

400
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,520
or tumor-resistant adenitis

401
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,840
today we are very simple

402
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,200
it means i want to see the stream

403
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,560
You said I typed something in

404
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,800
it will stay there

405
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,360
I just need to detect in this body

406
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,040
where is there a lot of this

407
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,200
then i'm one

408
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,920
Can hear clearly with microphone

409
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,400
Huh? There is a microphone

410
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
should be open

411
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
right

412
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
OK

413
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
OK too high

414
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
OK good

415
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That

416
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
OK so this part is

417
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
with this nano

418
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That is to say, the medicine behind nano

419
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
In fact, there is a major relationship

420
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
that is

421
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The tumor angiogenesis

422
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
would cause this to be different from normal this

423
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
where the organization is different

424
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
so that you can have this specificity

425
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And this is a

426
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What we replace is to say

427
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
you can see that is to say

428
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I had a small one here

429
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
cancer cells clump together

430
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
when it starts to turn into a tumor

431
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
it will flow from this artery

432
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
or venous

433
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
let them grow these blood vessels

434
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
provide it with nutrients

435
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
OK

436
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's the same as this example

437
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
OK

438
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
then we are talking now

439
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
In this common way of medical imaging

440
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
There are a few that I can't introduce one by one

441
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
but basically they

442
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
In fact, I just said that if you classify

443
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
to this

444
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The principles are very similar

445
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Just my first one I ever need to have a thing to go

446
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
to where you want to see

447
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
For example, in the way of this single-gloss paper

448
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This is using a

449
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You put a substance of this radiation

450
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
hit into the body

451
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
This radioactive material emits this

452
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
This GAMRAID

453
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
at this time you outside

454
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If there is a GAMRAID camera

455
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
you can take

456
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Tell me if this camera can take pictures

457
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
where did it come from

458
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Then it might have some

459
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
bring some products

460
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Or it has a special calibration function

461
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
then you can see where it's staying

462
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
or how it will be brought

463
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You will achieve the role of this visualization

464
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That or the positron way

465
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The positron method means using a positron

466
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It will be I-Mate

467
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
will be wiped out

468
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's this Zhengzi and this

469
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
are positively charged electrons

470
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Is a

471
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
if it collides with electrons

472
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It will generate about 500KV or so of this

473
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
This GAMRAID

474
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
it's in there

475
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
because it is gone after

476
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Just release this GAMRAID

477
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
GAMRAID it will generate

478
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I've been walking in the lazy direction since I was a kid

479
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So I grab these two from the entity

480
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The words of this Gamma Ray of this Gamma Ray

481
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I just draw a line

482
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I know where your stuff comes from

483
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's the way to know where your stuff is

484
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
produced

485
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Those things are not human

486
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's something you typed in

487
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So when you go to the hospital

488
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
If the doctor tells you this time

489
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You'd better ask if it's necessary

490
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Because doctors don't want to deal with these things themselves.

491
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's all radioactive

492
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Although its half-life may be short

493
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
like two days or three days

494
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
so i tried this

495
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Every medical image

496
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
it has its very important role

497
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But every side effect it must fall below it

498
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So I guess it means

499
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
most doctors he is not too

500
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
i'm not saying there's something wrong with the doctor

501
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Rather, the system now

502
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
like my father

503
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
He wants everyone their age

504
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
He likes to look like Shopping

505
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
he is in a different hospital

506
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Come to the hospital here to have a look

507
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
he felt unhappy he went to the inner courtyard

508
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But if you go to this one today

509
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
He asks you to be a CT

510
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That family asked you to be a CT again

511
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
this one in Taiwan

512
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Not registered on your health insurance card

513
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So you end up finding yourself doing it multiple times a year

514
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
No matter how safe he says it is

515
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You still end up with radiation damage

516
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
then we used to have a

517
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Academician of the American Academy of Sciences told us

518
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That is to say, this kind of sixty or seventy-year-old

519
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
He said that we all check another Mutation

520
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
will get cancer

521
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
One Mutation around

522
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So it has better be careful

523
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Then let me say this, for example,

524
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
to me just finished

525
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
here for example

526
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Ultrasound this is now

527
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Recognized as the least damaged

528
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So many people now think that ultrasound

529
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Said that the ultrasound will be better and better

530
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
He will probably replace most of this medical imaging

531
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That benevolent care is also a very Pobby

532
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But benevolent care has one of the biggest problems

533
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,380
For example like my dad he has this Pace Maker

534
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,960
have this starter

535
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,080
he can't do it

536
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,880
Then X-ray does not have this problem

537
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,760
but x-ray wait a minute i'll talk

538
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,040
it's his pity

539
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,600
He will also have this radioactive

540
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,880
The problem of radiation damage

541
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,440
Then you can this picture is us

542
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,720
I copy down

543
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,000
that is to say basically

544
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,920
every image of you

545
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,600
His Limit degree

546
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,960
with his resolution

547
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,720
it's all

548
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,600
so you might just say

549
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,280
what do i need to see

550
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,480
What kind of video mode do I want to use

551
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,960
that's very important

552
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,880
I have a few pictures here

553
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
I won't talk about it one by one

554
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,120
That's basically this

555
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,520
you went to the hospital

556
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,480
when you put it in

557
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,880
you probably know this

558
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,560
For example, he is now afraid that you

559
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,840
If you don't ask you can't figure it out

560
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,640
is he masago or spac

561
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,760
or mri

562
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,760
Anyway, it's the same as going into a hole

563
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,280
and tell you to sit over there

564
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,000
kind of good

565
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,320
and put you in later

566
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,760
Doctors just ran away

567
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,320
like positron emission because it's a radioactive substance

568
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,880
So it needs an accelerator to be able to produce this kind of isodigit

569
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,120
Ultrasound now also has a lot of progress

570
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,600
For example, basically it talks about the three-dimensional space

571
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,360
They even talk about ultrasound in the fourth dimension

572
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,600
Then I don't care about it

573
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,080
Basically it means that it gives you the same thing that you can say it

574
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,280
In the past, for example, we said that you want to see this pregnant woman

575
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,320
You have to see her child, she is in the clouds, you will see a look

576
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,760
It is possible now, that is to say, it can be viewed from three angles at the same time

577
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,640
These are big improvements

578
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:41,800
There is one for ultrasound, and I borrowed this from a research friend of ours.

579
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,240
That is, one of them has something to do with ultrasound and treatment

580
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,560
It's inside the micro-explosion they use ultrasonic waves

581
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,360
with whether it's the gene, the gene they need to deliver or the drug

582
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,320
and ultrasonically blast this micro cannon to shatter it

583
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,480
This is a normal process

584
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,040
But because of this shattering

585
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,160
Sometimes the first of many people is to say

586
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,400
It can actually be used to treat cancer

587
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,760
That is because when you sleep

588
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,600
this his this shockwave

589
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,920
When he was broken

590
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,680
this power is great

591
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,360
because I remember that in

592
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,400
when they said the earliest

593
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,200
at the time of World War I

594
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,400
The propeller of the ship they found

595
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,680
often breaks

596
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,040
easily damaged

597
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,040
It took him a long time to know that

598
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,800
So it was your propeller that went out

599
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,240
You have that blister when the blister pops

600
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,120
His strength is very great

601
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,000
You can hit this movement on this metal

602
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,920
So they then said

603
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,160
I will improve

604
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,280
So don't create so many bubbles

605
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,600
So this force of this bubble

606
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,400
That is to say, when we were actually making videos in the past,

607
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,920
hope to catch him

608
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,600
the first one he was very fast

609
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,880
It's him you and us become one ex

610
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,680
Saw this a while ago

611
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,760
Suddenly he disappeared

612
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,720
he exploded

613
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,320
At this time he produced this position

614
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,280
they are called shockwave

615
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,480
just like this is not normal

616
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,040
his this will not

617
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,840
Its spread these are not the same

618
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,440
So it will be very lethal to this cell

619
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,440
especially small ones

620
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,560
The other way is after I put the genuine goods

621
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
words near it

622
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,040
It is very possible that what I have on the inside

623
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,240
Enter this cell to achieve the purpose you want

624
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,000
Then this is ultrasound, which is related to this

625
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,440
useful place

626
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,160
You can see that the MRI is basically the same.

627
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,560
Then people here he wants

628
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,200
For example, when you want to be the head

629
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,600
He's gonna fix your head

630
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,240
Then this you can see images like this

631
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,560
That is to say, the biggest advantage of MRI is that

632
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,080
It is actually beneficial to soft tissue

633
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,680
Because it is mainly to image this clear

634
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,880
As long as you want it to be where there is water, it can

635
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,840
Then of course it has many other variations

636
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,200
There are functional MRI

637
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,760
diffuse MRI

638
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,600
It's anyway or you mix this developer differently

639
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,440
Doing it can do great imaging

640
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,120
that MRI and it's not very accessible

641
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,720
It's just that the damage to human nature is not high.

642
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,960
Of course sometimes you still have to apply developer

643
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,040
the developer

644
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,800
Everyone says that this is passed by the food hygiene in the United States.

645
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,840
but you play too much

646
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,640
you will feel uncomfortable

647
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,560
OK

648
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,840
So this is an MRI

649
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,440
So now I use very very Popular

650
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,320
But there is a problem with MRI relative

651
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,840
it's because it's still expensive

652
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,440
So if you go, if the health insurance does not pay

653
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,840
For example, now someone is

654
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,600
Just want to do this with MRI

655
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,240
breast design

656
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,760
Then if you do X-ray in general, it may be covered by health insurance

657
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,920
But if the MRI is not paid for

658
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,440
It might cost you 20,000 yuan to do it once

659
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,600
Of course there are considerable benefits

660
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,880
But even that probably isn't

661
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,000
This image that will become the front line

662
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,320
Then I just said that this is an example I gave

663
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,520
because i think of nanodiamonds

664
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,640
Our Zhonglian Rag has a very strong this

665
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,640
I really have this team that has done a good job

666
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,920
They're making nanodiamonds

667
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,040
nano diamonds you put some of these on

668
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
These materials you want to attach

669
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
it has some faith in itself

670
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It can also be used as a tool for confidence imaging

671
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm going to find this

672
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I originally wanted to talk to this licensed radiography and Naimi

673
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
what is the relationship

674
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Except for this developing machine

675
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Later I found out that they said

676
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You can do Naimi licensed radiography

677
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I went to see this paper

678
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Said it can do 70 resistance meters

679
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I think that's a big deal

680
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
after that

681
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Only then did he realize that they were not

682
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
They're here to look at the surface

683
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It is increased or decreased by this

684
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
with AFM

685
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
For example, this Tommy Force Microscope

686
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
With a very shoulder this scene

687
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and then be able to swipe across the surface

688
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
because it is very local

689
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Give it a very strong field

690
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
or gradient

691
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
it can cause MRI-like

692
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
This has the same effect as this licensed radiography

693
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So this has nothing to do with medical imaging

694
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
probably nothing

695
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
even images of living things

696
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm afraid it will be difficult

697
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
then i won't talk

698
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
then ourselves

699
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,720
team of friends cooperating inside

700
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,520
We have a Spec with MicroCT and PAC at the National Institutes of Health

701
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,060
these three put together

702
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,560
it's my machine

703
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,320
just one hole

704
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,600
you don't do three holes

705
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,560
a round this

706
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,100
then just be a mouse

707
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,260
its a small hole

708
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,300
After securing the mice and sending them over

709
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,900
You can do Spec at the same time

710
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,340
Then also get this PAC

711
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,000
Also get CT

712
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,300
we are here

713
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,100
I'm learning from this example now

714
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:37,200
This team basically hopes to develop different

715
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,500
radio isotope

716
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,600
The radio isotope is already known to be very fixed

717
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,500
what are they doing

718
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,200
it just said

719
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,600
please get different antibodies

720
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,400
or a different molecule

721
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,400
so that it can selectively go where

722
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,500
different places

723
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,600
Then use the line that measures against it this way

724
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,000
to know where it is

725
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,800
I won't go into detail about this part

726
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,600
Because this is probably a few pictures I can show

727
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,600
It's a mouse

728
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
you can see what i typed in

729
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
you just know

730
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,600
That is to say, this may be in the heart

731
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,600
you just know it's gonna come here

732
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
This is this image of this

733
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
clearer like this

734
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,800
You can see like this SPECT image

735
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
it looks at this radial isotope

736
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,300
this is radioactive

737
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,300
After this is added, it has a special function

738
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,300
You can see something like this actually outside of this

739
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,300
Neither is SPECT

740
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,300
These skeletons outside are actually made of X-ray

741
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,300
Its SPECT index will tell you

742
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,300
Where are these things you will light up

743
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,300
This skeleton is just to let you know

744
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,300
where do you take the mouse

745
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,300
These are probably images of SPECT

746
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,300
OK, I will finish my general introduction

747
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,300
For File

748
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,560
It's like a doctor's hospital

749
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,160
Now I'm going to talk about what I did

750
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,640
Of course when you do it yourself

751
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,240
I must say that the previous ones are not good.

752
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,440
right? I did it myself.

753
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,240
Otherwise why would I do it right?

754
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,960
good first thing

755
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,640
I'm going to say now that I do X-ray

756
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,560
Because the vice president just said

757
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,400
I've been doing it since I started

758
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,840
This is where the research begins

759
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,240
I'm in synchrotron radiation

760
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,840
So that's why I got synchrotron radiation

761
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,640
I can't do anything else

762
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,600
So that synchrotron radiation

763
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,360
is that it produces a lot of light

764
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,760
We just can't do every light

765
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,200
we did x-ray

766
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,760
X-ray it's just saying

767
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,040
with these other

768
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,960
i don't mean it per se

769
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,640
with these other blue pens

770
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,600
what good is it

771
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,640
The first is when it is used for imaging

772
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,760
it has one of the biggest benefits

773
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,840
That is, the range of things that can be seen is very large.

774
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,360
You see we can get from animals

775
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,040
that of course you all know

776
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,240
man is an animal

777
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,240
So there is no problem for you to take X-ray photos

778
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,800
That family has this X-ray that can take pictures

779
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,200
according to this elephant

780
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,040
and then there is

781
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,400
can take more

782
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,000
The most important benefit is its high penetration

783
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,800
I'll start over later

784
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,000
Another benefit is that its wavelength

785
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
For example, when we use an Astron

786
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It's one tenth of a rice

787
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
or shorter at this wavelength

788
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So the advantage of its short wavelength

789
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's kind of like when it's going this way

790
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
straight line particles

791
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
it doesn't have much volatility

792
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
At this time, it is your wave

793
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
when your waves are so short

794
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
when you want to make it like

795
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
For example, I make an optical microscope

796
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I want to make a Lens

797
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It's usually if you guys remember this high school physics

798
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
How is its resolution defined?

799
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Its resolution depends on your wavelength

800
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So something as simple as

801
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You're like this one in the semiconductor field

802
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
we felt a few years ago

803
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Aya they make this device

804
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Make it 0.25 micron and it will be the end

805
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
because they're doing it with visible light

806
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Do Ligography

807
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
do this lithography

808
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
then your light is

809
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
is 500nm

810
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
you have to do what you say

811
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
How do you make this smaller? It's about half

812
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Its wavelength is the end

813
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Then we think they can't do this anymore

814
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
But A anyway they invented a lot of weird ways

815
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
A just keep going

816
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Since then, people have been talking about

817
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
We should do this moment with S light

818
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
this lithography

819
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Because the wavelength of S light is so short

820
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
away from it this

821
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
will be limited by its wavelength

822
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Our name is Defreshing Limit

823
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
far away

824
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Well, this is of course another benefit for us.

825
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That is to say, we don’t care about doing X-ray today

826
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
What kind of Resolution

827
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
far from this

828
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So we are not limited by this physical basis

829
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
limited to

830
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Then another X-ray

831
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Except when first invented

832
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It is not used to make images

833
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
soon everyone will find out

834
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Although it is what I just said

835
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Although it has few fluctuating properties

836
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
in imaging it looks like

837
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
But actually it still has

838
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
it's still a wave

839
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Then you can have backshot and can eat

840
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,240
These are all available

841
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,520
It is X-ray deflection

842
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,920
It is the diffraction of X1

843
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,600
a person who makes materials

844
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,720
almost everyone

845
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
like our vice president

846
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,200
He's an expert at doing this X-ray scattering

847
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,000
He did it from a very young age

848
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,440
That fan shot too

849
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,320
In fact, it is the same X-ray physics

850
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,280
That part is actually

851
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,600
Materials Science is also provided

852
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,320
Physics is also good

853
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,360
a very large

854
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,080
This is a very useful tool

855
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,720
that recently someone was saying

856
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,080
We actually diffract

857
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,600
Let's say I have a crystal

858
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,320
I have a material

859
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,240
i want to know what it is made of

860
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,520
the easiest way

861
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,200
In fact, it is to do an X-ray diffraction

862
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,400
Then because you know

863
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,400
you know the arrangement of its atoms

864
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,040
how to line up

865
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,360
Then what is its crystal structure

866
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,840
You can get very complete information

867
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,080
But if your structure

868
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,520
not to say that there is no periodicity

869
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,240
For example, if you don't tie the crystal award

870
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,000
just me

871
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,840
A single molecule or a bunch is this

872
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,340
called morphous

873
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,440
just out of order

874
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,800
Then you will be in X-ray like this

875
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,540
Because X-ray is relying on it

876
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,340
After each thing is arranged periodically

877
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,740
it produces this constructive interference

878
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,940
You will only be able to detect it later

879
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,640
you know when it comes out

880
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,040
Scattering is sure to scatter

881
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,640
just be with me light hits anything and it scatter

882
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,940
But it won't have a strong

883
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,500
this reflected this

884
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,240
Or let you detect

885
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,240
So someone recently said

886
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,480
In fact, if my diffraction is strong enough

887
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,480
I can still do it like

888
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,480
Because no matter what

889
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
scattered things

890
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,280
I can reassemble it back to its original essence

891
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,680
I'll wait a while for this

892
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,580
i might talk

893
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,480
but this is a bit

894
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,380
Because it's still a long way from being an actual hero

895
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,480
And then of course it's X-ray it has to do

896
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,780
For example, your X-ray

897
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,580
You can also do energy spectrum analysis on this X-ray

898
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,180
For example, the absorption of X-rays

899
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,840
It is directly related to each material

900
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,980
each element

901
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,720
its absorbing properties

902
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
are not the same

903
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
It follows your atomic number

904
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
then when you absorb

905
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
The chemical state of each element

906
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
it's the state of this chemical piece

907
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Differently, its absorption will also

908
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
The absorption of wind will also change slightly

909
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So you do it this absorption supplement

910
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
or launch supplement

911
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You can get a lot of this material about it

912
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Or this analysis of this chemical state

913
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Then we actually put it behind this time.

914
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Not that it's as important as this thing

915
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It's rather new

916
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Then it now means that in addition to the previous

917
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
The absorbable imaging we just talked about

918
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Now there is one more new imaging mechanism for this

919
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'll take a moment to introduce this then wait a minute

920
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Of course X-ray is of course

921
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I think that's when X-ray was discovered in the first place

922
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Just now the vice president was still talking about

923
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
he watched some old this

924
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
example

925
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
That's when X-rays were first discovered

926
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
everyone is crazy

927
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And then it's basically like having this vending machine

928
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
you can drop a dollar

929
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It will make an S-Fone for you

930
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,200
You can see something like this when Google in 2010

931
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,440
That time was 115 years

932
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,200
Commemoration of Mun Kwon's discovery of X-rays

933
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,800
The earliest this is the first X-ray image

934
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,600
This image is said to be his wife's hand

935
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,400
So I say he was pretty smart back then

936
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,200
I probably know what I'm doing

937
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
It's his wife

938
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
OK

939
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,200
so

940
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,200
so from then on

941
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,000
The biggest advantage of X is why he is called X

942
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,200
is that he is a mystery

943
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,600
he is a very mysterious

944
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,200
He shows you things you couldn't see before

945
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
like me

946
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,600
I mean, I'm going to watch a movie on the plane

947
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,600
I think this is exactly what we're doing

948
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,600
That is to say, this is in this movie

949
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,000
He said this is the one from the life magazine

950
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,300
same name

951
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,200
To him is to see behind the walls

952
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,600
It is exactly what we X can do

953
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,000
How about seeing from behind the wall you can see

954
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Like this is the X-ray image

955
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
They scan the whole container

956
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You can actually see X-ray

957
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So of course you can see behind this wall

958
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Look at this is also the most brief

959
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
like this you can see he can scan the whole

960
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Connected to the engine of his car

961
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
can see clearly

962
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Let's say this is an example

963
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
They saw a container inside

964
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
There are dozens of hundreds of illegal immigrants

965
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
One more border from Mexico to the United States

966
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So this device of the Agrin sun

967
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
The way he scans is actually like this

968
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
He said one is fixed

969
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
a big block

970
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
In addition, he is still active

971
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
like this, for example, this machine

972
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
He put it on this truck

973
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
He can go to the container terminal

974
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
they all sweep it over

975
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
He knew what was in there

976
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
like this is actually a good

977
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
This technology transfer

978
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,720
This topic is all the big scanners in the mainland

979
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,000
They are all calculated by Tsinghua University in Beijing.

980
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So Beijing Tsinghua University relies on this year alone

981
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,600
I heard that there can be four to five billion RAM

982
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,000
Means this Bloyote is back

983
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,000
That's generally speaking

984
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,120
I said you can see

985
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,320
That's why we love X-ray

986
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,720
Just say you see this is not our own invention

987
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,300
It was in the United States

988
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,720
I can sell you a pair of glasses

989
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,940
It can be like having an X-ray edition

990
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,440
Everyone, look how happy he is

991
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,720
and a dollar

992
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,440
OK

993
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,280
of course it's fake

994
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,340
But that means you can know that everyone is right

995
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,440
this period in childhood

996
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,940
We've always wanted superhuman strength

997
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,940
you can see through this wall

998
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,620
This is X-ray

999
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,940
One of the most interesting things

1000
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,940
like this

1001
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,940
This is what I found on Google

1002
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,740
funny cartoon

1003
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Then for example like this

1004
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
Also we can see all the things

1005
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
OK, this is actually made by the same company

1006
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And just talking to the vice president

1007
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Everyone uses it for everything

1008
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Back then someone was shooting X-ray movies

1009
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Not an X-ray movie

1010
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It's an X-ray movie, that means everyone go

1011
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
just watch it move

1012
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Then you can watch them with X-ray

1013
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Let's see if your shoes fit

1014
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I hope it still has this foot after two years

1015
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Then there are, for example

1016
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I don't know if you have this

1017
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
download the app for this phone

1018
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Just say that after you take a photo

1019
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
after photo

1020
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
you look like

1021
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
although it's fake

1022
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
it's not real

1023
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
then like these

1024
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Of course there are serious applications

1025
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Like say this is

1026
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
X-ray is a very important application

1027
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I mean I want to see these

1028
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Whether my semiconductor manufacturing process is wind

1029
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
After these are done

1030
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
don't need to open

1031
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
so at this time

1032
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
this is what we did

1033
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
because we are limited by our

1034
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
This is what we call Fuel of View

1035
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
First we are the size of the window

1036
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,200
So we for example say

1037
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,000
This SD memory card we have to take photos all the time

1038
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I've been putting it together like this

1039
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It's a bit like doing jigsaw puzzles on your mobile phone now

1040
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
come out and you can see

1041
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
How is there a line connected here?

1042
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So let's say it's not connected well somewhere

1043
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
In fact, it is easy to check out with this S light.

1044
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So most of the packaging

1045
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
is the PCB

1046
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
This is the motherboard company

1047
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
In fact, we have always had many companies

1048
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Wish we did this job for them

1049
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But even if these companies

1050
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
He won't give you too much money

1051
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
then ask you to do many things

1052
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
actually those things

1053
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
They can buy this machine by themselves

1054
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So we're mostly working on that as well

1055
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
That S light has one

1056
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,760
There should be a lot of people doing it in the yard

1057
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:08,260
By absorbing this S-Quam from outer space this universe

1058
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:13,260
Look at it at the time of the big bang

1059
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,460
Up to now, these astronomical problems

1060
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,760
Then why did I bring this up

1061
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,420
That is to say, this detector

1062
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:24,000
You want to detect X-ray and what we are doing X-ray is X-ray

1063
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,160
we need to detect it

1064
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,620
It is very important to develop this detector in the middle

1065
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,320
Many of them come from here

1066
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,320
That has so many benefits but also many problems

1067
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,560
For example like

1068
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,720
Tell him this is the truth that I have been talking about

1069
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,120
sometimes is ugly

1070
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,760
It's just that the real world may not be as good as you think

1071
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,820
but you can see through when

1072
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,020
Then

1073
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,520
But the biggest problem is actually this

1074
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,920
OK so you can look at this

1075
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,120
Yeah I don't know you know what he's talking about

1076
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
OK so why is this bad

1077
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
because I just told you

1078
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You still have the consideration of skin color

1079
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yeah, I remember we were a while ago

1080
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That is to say, at that time, I went with this professor Zhang Weihao

1081
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
While in the US we visited a

1082
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Fellow of the American Academy of Sciences

1083
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
He said he would not go abroad

1084
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
He said because he didn't want to be Scanned

1085
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
He said this Scan

1086
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
He said according to his calculations

1087
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
That is to say, there are thirty, twenty, forty in California

1088
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
He did that Scan once

1089
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
words like this

1090
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
he did the math

1091
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
He thinks his Dose

1092
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Do half CT with you

1093
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Half tomography is the same

1094
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
yes ok

1095
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
So like this is what they put on

1096
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
You people go this way, go over there and raise your hands high

1097
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
you can get

1098
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And in this way they use the backlight

1099
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
He didn't show you the bones

1100
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Because it's useless for him to look at your bones

1101
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
He actually wants Scan to hit you

1102
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
will reflect

1103
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Those of us who studied Scan physics at that time

1104
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
just feel weird

1105
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
why such a good idea

1106
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
we didn't think

1107
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
This is all understanding

1108
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
A business of several billion dollars

1109
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
The reason is that his radiation dose is still very high

1110
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
only when they are for national security

1111
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
didn't take it as a strict script

1112
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So Europe bans this

1113
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
European airports do not have such scanners

1114
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
In the United States, they are now also changing

1115
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Basically they end up with

1116
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And like the American Academy of Sciences, they also wrote a letter to Obama

1117
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
say you are for national security

1118
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
you skip these things

1119
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
That is to say, if you really want to make a medical device

1120
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You just review these experiments

1121
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
just to give you this license

1122
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
it could be years

1123
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
But under the big hat of national security

1124
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
get it out

1125
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Then the company tells you about safety

1126
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
just say safe

1127
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Then go in and do it

1128
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
so this is me in

1129
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
this is where you can see us

1130
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
often pass like this

1131
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It's actually like him here

1132
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
X-ray

1133
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,300
I just told you why it's not good

1134
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,300
you know this is a photo from long ago

1135
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,300
You can see him spawning XA here

1136
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,300
He's just over there looking happy

1137
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:12,300
Yeah, I just said I hope they live less

1138
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,300
That's a wrong example

1139
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,300
OK so now everyone

1140
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,300
Decades later, everyone found out that it is very simple

1141
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,300
Many people die very early

1142
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,300
like this madame curie

1143
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,300
he is what he did

1144
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,300
He didn't think of this thing at that time

1145
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,300
but later

1146
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,300
He started to get affected by the overhead beam

1147
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,300
like this too

1148
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,300
Then I'll show some more

1149
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,300
It's the photo of this famous person's Ace Light

1150
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,300
This was caught on the Internet

1151
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,300
This is the president of the old Ross House in 1900

1152
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,300
He got a gunshot wound on him and hit a guy

1153
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,300
I heard he was beaten

1154
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,300
Just like our President Chen Zhiyuan

1155
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,300
After playing, he also gave a 90-minute TOP

1156
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,300
no feeling at all

1157
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,300
only found out at the end

1158
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
OK, come here, there's already a

1159
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:08,840
There is another famous person, I think I should know about it after watching American cartoons

1160
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,840
no, you can see him

1161
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:16,840
And when I take it, you can see that X-ray has been used for organization

1162
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,340
We can look at his physical appearance, for example, I can see that his brain is very small

1163
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,840
but i don't know what he's doing

1164
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,840
So I don't want to say now, we can know what is in his mind, if we can know what he is thinking

1165
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,840
Then you can achieve the effect of the function, the function image

1166
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,340
OK, there is another very famous X-ray, I don’t know if you can recognize it

1167
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,340
Called Tony Stark

1168
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:45,340
Then you can see that after he came out, his measurements reconstructed it

1169
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:49,840
You can look like this, this person I think you should probably know him

1170
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,840
OK, this is that one, and there is a famous X-ray

1171
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,840
Then this is Franklin

1172
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,560
This is the first X-ray image of DNA

1173
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,960
I think the deputy dean should be very clear

1174
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,640
Everyone thought he should have won the Nobel Prize

1175
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,280
As a result, Jin Watson and Luke Tan took his picture away

1176
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,920
I wrote the result but didn't include it

1177
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,400
This is a very famous X-ray

1178
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,000
but not like this

1179
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,920
Choose to wrap

1180
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,400
X-ray was used and many other tasks were done

1181
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,120
like this is a i don't know what this is

1182
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,400
But it's also famous

1183
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,560
After you read it with X-ray

1184
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,400
They can see that actually inside

1185
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,640
Because if there is, you could have written it first

1186
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,800
Then you can change

1187
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,240
So they can see in this way that he is actually another painting inside

1188
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,560
they later changed it all

1189
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,960
Then there is another famous

1190
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,520
This is the mummy found in Egypt

1191
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,480
This is what a cat looks like

1192
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,840
But it actually has a hair wrapped in it

1193
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,680
this is his body

1194
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,920
So these x-rays

1195
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,620
When in use are standing in a shit

1196
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,620
that I can penetrate

1197
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,620
I can also see inside

1198
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,120
Can satisfy everyone's good habits

1199
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,620
So how can I open this thing

1200
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,220
For example, people are a very troublesome thing

1201
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,020
people

1202
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,800
I remember one time the Discovery Channel was saying

1203
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,620
19th century

1204
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,660
The greatest and most important medical method is the inner century

1205
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,920
This is the first time someone stuffed a mirror into your belly

1206
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,060
can see inside

1207
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,160
It's very Fascinating

1208
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,220
Trouble with people because of animals or people

1209
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,220
For example, if you want to see inside

1210
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,220
unless you kill it

1211
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,220
Now finally there is a thing that is

1212
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,220
i can watch while i'm alive

1213
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,220
popular at the time

1214
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,220
You can see this is also an old ad

1215
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,220
You can see them claiming to say

1216
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,220
After taking a double photo, you won't have a headache

1217
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,220
i think it might be

1218
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:51,220
You see this nerve has been injured

1219
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:55,220
But it's not impossible

1220
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,220
you can watch this now

1221
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,220
For example, our friend is in the mountains

1222
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,220
he gave me this

1223
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,500
This is an active accelerator

1224
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,500
It can produce fine X-rays like this coin

1225
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,500
it's doing radiation therapy

1226
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,500
Usually during radiotherapy

1227
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,500
I'll just say I know there's a tumor here

1228
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,000
I will follow

1229
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,500
But when I take pictures, I don't want to take pictures of them all

1230
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,000
nowhere else

1231
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,500
will make a cover

1232
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,500
put this place

1233
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,500
X-rays in other places are blocked

1234
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,500
I made a little progress later

1235
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,000
I just don't want to do it once

1236
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
do it here

1237
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,500
Because X-rays don't tell the difference

1238
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
all injured

1239
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,500
I'll do a few more angles

1240
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,500
I can do 10 angles

1241
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,500
Like it claims to be able to do these 1000 angles

1242
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,500
I know where your tumor is

1243
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,500
I move this coin

1244
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,500
i've been following it

1245
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,500
The advantage is that when I was in cancer

1246
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,500
I can give it, for example, its dose of 1

1247
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,500
elsewhere it's

1248
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,500
actually only one thousandth

1249
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,500
If it uses a thousand of this projection

1250
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
will effectively reduce the

1251
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,500
Radiation therapy to normal tissue

1252
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,500
So how could it work

1253
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,500
but this is of course not

1254
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,540
Image application

1255
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,840
But you also know like him

1256
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,640
The most important part of this technology

1257
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,480
In fact, it’s not that I made this detector to do this.

1258
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,020
another you locate

1259
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,200
Like for example he does a lot of these two treatments

1260
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,880
For example, you may be able to receive

1261
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,640
because you are fixed

1262
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,940
You have a small tumor on your body

1263
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,000
or a tumor of, say, a centimeter or two

1264
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,300
The person on you is moving and breathing

1265
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,120
So they have to have good video equipment nearby

1266
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:30,220
Usually when you go to a hospital there are two big x-ray machines

1267
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,260
Then under him is his detector

1268
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,060
he can at the same time

1269
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,360
Track your body's movements

1270
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,640
Then when he set

1271
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,660
he predictably said

1272
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,720
I'm now you're selling me like this

1273
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,000
or you breathe

1274
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,780
he next time

1275
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,340
Where will you move when he moves to this point?

1276
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:49,160
You are still making predictions

1277
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,460
Speaking of this focus

1278
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,480
we mean

1279
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,760
when doing imaging

1280
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,780
For example, usually you do it in a hospital

1281
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,340
I'll talk about why the hospital can't do it later

1282
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,400
made these more detailed videos

1283
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,000
that image

1284
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,520
that reason is that

1285
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,000
This quality of iShade

1286
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Its light source is of poor quality

1287
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,560
That also has a better iShade light source

1288
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,520
I use a very small

1289
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,800
I let it focus called very small

1290
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,560
It produces a small spot of light

1291
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,920
then we bring it

1292
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,800
for example look at this

1293
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,720
This IC

1294
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,320
Check out this Madeleboa these

1295
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,320
we actually

1296
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,600
this is for

1297
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,000
It can be done without synchronous auxiliary test

1298
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,720
can do it now

1299
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,920
then use this way

1300
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,320
i'm talking about this

1301
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,680
Before using the synchronous test

1302
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,120
I will talk about this project

1303
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,480
This has nothing to do with audiovisual

1304
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,520
but what we recently did

1305
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,520
because it's interesting

1306
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,680
And I think this will be of interest to everyone

1307
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,680
that is to say this

1308
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,840
This is our latest

1309
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,480
with our European

1310
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,360
this collaborator

1311
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,920
they are saying they are

1312
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,920
this place is in venice

1313
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,560
Venice means they are a port

1314
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,240
from hundreds of years

1315
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,640
access to all their ports

1316
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,240
must have many files

1317
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,240
then this file

1318
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,920
He could count millions, numbers like this

1319
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,160
In a room like this, there might be thirty rooms like this

1320
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,760
So something like this would say

1321
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,080
In fact, because he is not like the dead sea scripture

1322
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,280
You just take one roll and I'll find a way to finish it

1323
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,760
He has a lot so you don't want

1324
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,280
It's not just about him being afraid of his damage

1325
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,960
For example, you've been through something like this

1326
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,960
Of course you don't want you to drive around

1327
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,320
So of course there will be injuries when this is opened.

1328
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,040
But the most important reason is not this

1329
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,680
Instead we want to be able to quickly put it into arcibe

1330
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,640
It's a bit like a digital power plant in our courtyard

1331
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,480
they just thought

1332
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,160
The people we worked with thought of doing it with X-rays

1333
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,160
what is he going to do

1334
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,520
He told me not to open the book

1335
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,120
I lock up I do tomography

1336
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,480
I do tomography

1337
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,480
I can finally put the contents inside

1338
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,080
It is the way of reading without opening the book

1339
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,880
You can grab all the text inside

1340
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,320
Well, we've just started doing a little

1341
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,640
This is actually pretty exciting

1342
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,320
Because now Venice has a very famous society

1343
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
In vain

1344
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
When they invited us to do it in June

1345
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
They will go to a Public Event

1346
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Tell everyone that they are ready to officially start

1347
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Later on their side

1348
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
if done well

1349
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
they will buy dozens

1350
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
The S2 machine like this

1351
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
put it on over there

1352
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Scan it down for each one

1353
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
We did some Pre-Limit results

1354
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I just want to say that this is a Mass manuscript I bought.

1355
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
actually it's interesting

1356
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
that means i'm thinking right away

1357
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Why can't it be done in our hospital?

1358
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Or the Palace Museum

1359
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
the place of difference

1360
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
this europe from

1361
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Beginning less than a thousand years AD

1362
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
while they were writing

1363
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
From the one called InkGull

1364
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
it this is a number

1365
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
count three removed things

1366
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
a bit like jelly sauce

1367
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
The compounded thing is this iron oxide particle

1368
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
So it has metal content in it

1369
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
So X-ray can be seen

1370
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
The east is more advanced

1371
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Dongfang uses the Song Ni box is the carbon in the X-ray

1372
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,280
there is no comparison

1373
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,840
So the way Europe looks like this

1374
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:08,360
It took almost a thousand years to a few years in the 1880s

1375
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,080
to the nineteenth century

1376
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:14,120
They only accepted the ink from the East after it came in

1377
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,800
They just started using this

1378
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,080
So the benefit is to become

1379
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,880
We have so many hundreds of years of Windows

1380
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,480
You can do it with SWIT

1381
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,600
Then we tried it and it turned out to be like this example

1382
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,320
This one is from 1566 and it's written on it

1383
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,320
this is its age

1384
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:33,440
This Manual Script was first written in 1566

1385
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,400
Then ours is visible light

1386
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,360
We will do S light now

1387
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,240
we stack it

1388
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,960
you can watch slowly

1389
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,360
This is our S light video

1390
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,000
This Manual Script

1391
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,600
Unfortunately is very unfortunate

1392
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,960
mean it's inside

1393
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,600
we are talking

1394
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,240
Our students are talking about our Posa

1395
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,080
Said it was black heart ink

1396
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,480
Actually there's nothing in it

1397
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,640
what's this like

1398
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,760
so you can see

1399
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,600
Our paper sees clearly

1400
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,840
but the paper can't see

1401
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
like this, good, like this

1402
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
You can see it, we're like stacking it directly on top of it

1403
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
You can see that the back is now S1 looking at this in the past

1404
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
This is the image made by S1

1405
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
So it means that at least this word can be developed

1406
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
So it's important for me to come back and talk to people about developer

1407
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
You don’t have a developer for this thing, no matter how good your image is in terms of resolution

1408
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
No matter how fast you are, it's useless

1409
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So what becomes of this manipulating this developer

1410
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
It becomes a great knowledge, so generally this

1411
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
The medical imaging equipment, in the developer market

1412
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Usually it accounts for one-third to one-half of its market

1413
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Then we made a very simple simulation, because we can't afford it yet

1414
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Or you can't get the book, because we got a

1415
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
industrial stack it on top of each other and do the rotation

1416
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Then let's try to solve this by hand

1417
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
After they are solved, they can be identified

1418
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Then use this small X-ray code

1419
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,640
It is our laboratory that can buy it

1420
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,040
It won't be very expensive to install

1421
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,440
we can already do it

1422
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,000
For example, look at the cerebral blood vessels of this mouse

1423
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,600
it's the whole brain the whole brain

1424
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,400
so you can see

1425
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,400
When there are not many diseases that can be identified here

1426
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,640
didn't get what we wanted

1427
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,840
but this is because

1428
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,340
In this brain of your mouse

1429
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,640
let it hit this developer

1430
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,440
The same problem with developer

1431
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,240
That's not because of insufficient resolution

1432
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,640
can look like this

1433
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,440
You can see that we just made a few angles

1434
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,640
You can see how the distribution of its blood vessels looks like

1435
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,840
OK, so what I want to tell you now is that

1436
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,040
X-rays of these

1437
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,840
That is to say, no more than

1438
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,640
Most of us can now do

1439
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,040
But what I'm going to tell you now

1440
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,240
That is to say, I actually said

1441
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,240
Is this this X-ray from your grandfather's time

1442
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,840
That means we can be safe with this

1443
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,440
ask any of this doctors

1444
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,640
you talk to him

1445
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,940
This X-ray can be compared

1446
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,840
he has absolutely no idea what you're talking about

1447
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,040
Then you can say can do

1448
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Of course he doesn't know about the elements and chemical composition

1449
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
You see, it is said that 15 nanometers can be achieved

1450
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Or at this time he won't believe it

1451
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
But this is all because of what Fu Yuannan said just now.

1452
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
this synchrotron radiation

1453
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
S-light produced by synchrotron radiation

1454
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
His quality is very good

1455
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
That is to say, if you want to compare synchrotron radiation

1456
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
It's kind of like a laser

1457
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
When imaging, especially the imaging of S light

1458
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Say you're going to do

1459
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I'll talk later

1460
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Because this way we can do a comparison

1461
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
There are many different ways of comparing

1462
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
But the basic principle is that

1463
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I these two materials like I would have been

1464
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
would give an example like your glass of water

1465
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
When you drink water you are in a bottle

1466
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
If it is full, you cannot see its interface

1467
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
You don't know it's you just look at it and don't touch it

1468
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
You don't know it's oil and water

1469
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
but when you're half full

1470
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
you can see that surface

1471
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Why

1472
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
This is actually not because of absorption.

1473
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
but because of refraction

1474
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Because its surface no matter what

1475
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Your visible light passes to your side

1476
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
it has some folds

1477
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
you can watch it edge

1478
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
so you can tell it's water

1479
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
But today is full

1480
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
That is to say, its absorption of light by water

1481
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Absorption of visible light

1482
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Not much different from air

1483
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
so you don't have a mechanism that can image

1484
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
then we are now saying

1485
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
use this word

1486
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
That is to say, S light affects different materials

1487
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
It absorbs differently

1488
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
That is to say, the absorption of bone and meat is of course different.

1489
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
But S only changes bones

1490
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I have seen it for more than a hundred years

1491
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
then you can't watch anything else

1492
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
because of something else

1493
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Its absorption between the flesh and the flesh

1494
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Its absorption of S light

1495
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
are almost the same

1496
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
then we are thinking now

1497
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
if that is to say

1498
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
But these two organizations

1499
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Its absorption of S light

1500
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Although it is very close

1501
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
But its refractive index is not the same

1502
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
The refractive index of S light is not the same

1503
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
it's on the edge

1504
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
will cause some refraction effect

1505
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
You may have a chance to catch the edge of it

1506
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
This is the so-called copper axial contrast

1507
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
The other is to get it in a different way

1508
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
The refractive index of each material is different

1509
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
The so-called comparative

1510
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Because when compared to the positive wave

1511
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
it affects its future

1512
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
The future of the wave is because of your material

1513
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
that is to say like the refractive index

1514
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Is the refractive index that affects it

1515
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
There are several different ways

1516
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It's all on X-ray now

1517
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
These are known when visible light rises

1518
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Like Zernikey, Contra, Zernikey

1519
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Wait for Wire Price in the 1950s and 1960s

1520
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Up to now, it can be done in XGrade

1521
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
i just told you

1522
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
X-rays have the ability to distinguish elements

1523
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
It also has the ability to distinguish its chemical composition

1524
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
So we can use this way

1525
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
We look at the same iron

1526
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
inside the plastic

1527
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
We can know that this iron is not only

1528
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And it's oxidized iron oxide

1529
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
is to use this imaging method

1530
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I will talk about the resolution later

1531
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Defresher image

1532
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
This is relative to the current development of a new exchange

1533
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
What we call X-ray finally has

1534
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
This was the earliest when Ronald Reagan was president

1535
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
There is that new battle plan to do at the beginning

1536
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Only hope I get a really strong S-1

1537
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
You can just shoot the missile down

1538
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
or take down someone else's satellite

1539
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
but it never worked out

1540
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
But the concept of this is the development of this

1541
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
continues until now

1542
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Now there are real lasers

1543
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I think we are now using an accelerator

1544
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Make this S-1 out

1545
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
it's like a laser

1546
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
it has good coherence

1547
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
good destructive

1548
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
The application of this in the next few years

1549
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
i think it will come out slowly

1550
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
But it's just now

1551
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
For example, the first such machine

1552
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Started using it about two years ago at Stanford

1553
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
four years

1554
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
In Japan, it may have been used two years ago

1555
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
we now also hope

1556
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
We are in Zhongyuanyuan

1557
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
be able to have some planning for using this aspect

1558
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
my own hope is to say

1559
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
In 2015 we were able to

1560
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Take this S-1 resolution

1561
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
are pushing further from Sunaimi to this road Nanami

1562
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Then I have some nano

1563
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
There is an important development

1564
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It's like this image reconstruction method called tomography.

1565
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
when you do a normal tomography scan

1566
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
while we are doing

1567
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
For example, my image

1568
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I take an angle

1569
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Then I rotate this sample

1570
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
or rotate your light source

1571
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I took it variously for future

1572
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I reconstructed it mathematically

1573
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
its three-dimensional entity

1574
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
It used to be said that I wanted a lot from the angle I took.

1575
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Because you take less angles

1576
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
you'll end up jumping

1577
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
You have some places you will miss like this

1578
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
So becomes what you now assume

1579
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
we usually do

1580
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
We made this image at Statistical Services

1581
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
We may take 360 ​​sheets

1582
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
It means that we take, for example, a half-time

1583
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Take 180 degrees

1584
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Or even you want more to get 1000

1585
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
But in the past, if it was used on humans

1586
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Now generally used

1587
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
They all want as little as possible

1588
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
The less I have this angle of this exposure

1589
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I can reassemble the best

1590
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
so i tried this

1591
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
A lot of people who are working on this side are doing this

1592
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,600
This is a 2012 job

1593
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,600
they think they have a new way

1594
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:12,000
under conditions of little projection

1595
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
You can get a very good three-dimensional reconstruction

1596
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,600
let me mention this

1597
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,600
Because the collaborators of this group

1598
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,000
It was called a theory with our chief Li Lingguo

1599
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
he is also interested in this

1600
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,600
They just said they were doing some work on this

1601
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,200
This is a breast tissue

1602
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,600
this place is kind of oil

1603
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,600
He can use very little dirt

1604
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,600
Very few projections can be made

1605
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,600
Now during mammography

1606
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,600
Basically he only does one

1607
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,600
They now have people say do tomothin fact

1608
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,600
He might be able to do some angles

1609
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,600
They claim to do better

1610
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,600
Alvation develop like this goes on

1611
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,600
Maybe after being so supernatural now

1612
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,600
It is easy to get the structure of 3-dimensional space

1613
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,600
It is of course helpful to judge them

1614
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,600
when i see the two now

1615
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,600
something in the middle

1616
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,600
But his relative position

1617
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,400
For example, these small generalization points

1618
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,900
It correlates to the location of breast cancer judged by doctors

1619
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,000
still very helpful

1620
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,900
Many of their doctors would like to be able to do this

1621
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,400
This is another TOMO SENSOR

1622
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,800
I just use a few pictures to get results like TOMOGRAPHY

1623
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,800
Like the result of broken seedlings

1624
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,100
In addition, some development is very important

1625
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,800
For example, the S-light detector

1626
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,200
S-light detector when we started doing S-light

1627
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,900
We are thinking of using it on people

1628
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:32,200
Definitely the best sensitivity

1629
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,500
But in fact, there are still technological developments

1630
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,900
like i remember years ago

1631
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:43,000
When everyone uses a camera, it is still a CCD

1632
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,800
CCD is a kind of device

1633
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,300
No one is using CCD now

1634
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,800
Now almost all are C-MOS detectors

1635
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:56,400
The X-ray detector only has different materials in the upper part

1636
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,400
Mine is sensitive to S-light

1637
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,000
but produces this

1638
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
The way the signal is actually very close

1639
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,500
that has another subscript

1640
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,500
This is what we have in our lock now

1641
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,500
Come to be the chairman and academician

1642
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,000
Then this is of course ready-made

1643
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,500
H&D type already available

1644
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,500
But this company is the Swiss Syncertron

1645
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,000
It has a kid team when it's ready

1646
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,500
they turned it out

1647
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,000
So this is a very successful example

1648
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I was originally because the scientists wanted to use

1649
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,500
I'm going to use this nice thing

1650
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,500
After getting it done, they found it very useful

1651
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,500
just went out and started a company

1652
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,500
The company is quite successful now

1653
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,000
a detector like this

1654
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
when he first came out

1655
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
their name is

1656
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
One pixel one dollar

1657
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,500
So like this 6 million pixel

1658
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,500
it this Ding-san

1659
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,000
It's Bohata down to about

1660
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Let's say $1 million

1661
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
like this

1662
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Then this detector

1663
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
He does everything

1664
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
his usual place is

1665
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
a pixel in me

1666
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I have an electronic system

1667
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
i've always been i've been like

1668
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
put a small detector in the

1669
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,500
put it together

1670
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,500
Then his advantage is his predecessor

1671
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,000
put these things together

1672
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
its noise will be less

1673
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
So their detector claims to say

1674
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
we put it there

1675
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
like you now your CC

1676
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
your regular camera

1677
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
mobile phone camera

1678
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
when it's dark

1679
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
why not

1680
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
you soon it's noise

1681
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
It has a lot of signal noise

1682
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
you shoot longer

1683
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Noise overwhelms your image

1684
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
like it this

1685
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
you can shoot for half an hour

1686
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
no noise

1687
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
that of course

1688
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
That is to say, it is used for medical purposes.

1689
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
This imaging is very good

1690
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
why no one does

1691
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
then you will know why

1692
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
that's too expensive

1693
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
then we know this company

1694
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Its IC is made in Taiwan

1695
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
because the world has only

1696
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Taiwan's TSMC and UMC

1697
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
It can accept this small

1698
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Small quantity for this order

1699
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
So their IC is made in Taiwan

1700
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
so they just go out later

1701
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Plus their detector

1702
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
The class of this material

1703
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
That's so expensive

1704
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
So after we made an appointment with the chairman

1705
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
he thinks this thing

1706
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Taiwan should have no problem doing

1707
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
So we now have a program

1708
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,160
The director's office is that they made a similar detector a while ago

1709
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,000
The detector is in front of Japan

1710
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,760
they did deletronics

1711
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,960
Just cooperate with Japan's Free Latch on Laser

1712
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,300
they took

1713
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:16,200
But after they took it, it seems that there is no afternoon

1714
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,960
they said fine fine thank you

1715
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,800
no more

1716
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:24,100
It means that we are actually capable of doing this

1717
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:27,860
Because they must be able to do it in Japan

1718
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:31,720
It's just that what they may do is not what we do

1719
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,220
About X-rays related to Naimi

1720
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:35,660
I just used this example

1721
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,420
Manufacture of the first of our Nami components

1722
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,420
It's the X-ray we just talked about

1723
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,820
We can do very high resolution

1724
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:44,060
But the reason for this is why it couldn't be done before

1725
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,420
It's because now we have the technology made by Nami

1726
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:50,160
We can do X-ray optics

1727
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:55,320
achieve very good resolution

1728
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,120
In addition, we just told you

1729
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,120
X-ray resolution enhancement

1730
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,960
It's useless if you don't compare

1731
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,660
I'll give you a piece of meat now

1732
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:06,760
Your resolution is as high as possible

1733
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,600
You put it under your S1 is white

1734
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,860
you are useless

1735
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:13,540
So to develop this nanoparticle

1736
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,600
The developing machine and the calibration machine are very important

1737
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,040
before doing this

1738
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,800
It's useless for you to increase the resolution

1739
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,840
Then we say in another

1740
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,340
we actually this

1741
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:25,160
At the same time, make this S1

1742
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,840
When you can see nanometer resolution

1743
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,800
We can also do a lot about this

1744
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,800
Natal technology

1745
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,900
For example, we can study

1746
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,760
When we are doing electroplating

1747
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,460
why is it better

1748
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:35,760
it's not good to do that

1749
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,960
Usually you have to cut it

1750
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,000
It is very troublesome to use e-sports to watch

1751
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,160
we can now at

1752
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,060
Even when I'm electroplating

1753
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,840
Just look at how long it is

1754
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,840
then adjust to its best condition

1755
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:47,860
so this is a feedback

1756
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,540
That's when we have this nice nano

1757
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:51,640
When this detection technique

1758
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:54,360
It will also be helpful for our nano-manufacturing

1759
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,400
Then there is another one

1760
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,960
When we were doing this S1 imaging

1761
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,520
The location of your sample

1762
01:03:59,520 --> 01:03:59,960
for example

1763
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Then I said to do this Tomography

1764
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,400
I'm going to do this tomography

1765
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,400
i let it turn

1766
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,400
There is no mechanical equipment

1767
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,400
So it can be said that when I turn

1768
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,400
this thing

1769
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,600
You now have our Naimi resolution images

1770
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,400
So the size of this whole

1771
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,800
Only 10micron

1772
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,400
i just told you

1773
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,900
Hair is 100micron

1774
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:18,800
it's your hair

1775
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,800
One out of ten Full of you

1776
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,400
and now you have to turn something

1777
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,800
you want it this axis

1778
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,200
stay here

1779
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,400
mechanically impossible

1780
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,600
so it becomes

1781
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,800
you zoom it in

1782
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,200
when you turn

1783
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,200
This way this reorganized this

1784
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:37,200
There is no way to do this calculation

1785
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,600
So we have to try our best to find a way

1786
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,600
fix this problem

1787
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,400
One solution is to say

1788
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,800
when i let it take a step

1789
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,100
I will tune

1790
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,100
I need a good positioning

1791
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,000
i know where it is

1792
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:50,600
After turning

1793
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,500
I'll let it recalibrate

1794
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,400
This is what we are currently doing

1795
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,100
Before I talk about some practical examples

1796
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,100
Then before I would

1797
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,240
Let me first tell you about this cooperator.

1798
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:08,800
I put it in yellow to be a physics person

1799
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,360
That is to say, they make this equipment like me

1800
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:15,200
Then do this development

1801
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:20,400
including in Switzerland, in the U.S. and in South Korea

1802
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,840
OK

1803
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:25,440
Then my own Team probably has so many people now

1804
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,000
Then the yellow one is the Queen of the National Society

1805
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,840
that's all we did

1806
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:34,880
You can see that the whole combination is our current Program

1807
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,720
The biggest goal of doing this Program is

1808
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,440
I hope it can give us the same radiation as Taiwan.

1809
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,600
The new accelerator

1810
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:48,720
A scientific project for this storage ring

1811
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,560
This is what we are using now

1812
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,000
Called Taiwan Line Source

1813
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,240
This is Taiwan's Photon Source

1814
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,560
If you have the opportunity to visit now

1815
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,040
This outer body is finished

1816
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,080
Thank you so much now

1817
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
They may be hoping within the next year

1818
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,000
If users in Taiwan can start using it next year

1819
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
The XFE I was talking about just now is the free electron laser

1820
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
This is an accelerator in Japan called SprayA

1821
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
It is the statistical radiation with the highest energy in the world

1822
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
And also a very good quality one

1823
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
This is their free electron laser

1824
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
This length is about 700 meters

1825
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
So it takes 700 meters to accelerate this electron

1826
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Also after some processing

1827
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
so that its final can produce very strong

1828
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,000
It is a very short pulse

1829
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Say 50-50 Fantlose Second

1830
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Fantlose Second is better than Pico in...

1831
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
OK is Nano and below is Pico

1832
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Pico is Fantlose again

1833
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Each is 1000 times worse

1834
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
So it's this...

1835
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Time is it, this wave is a very short pulse

1836
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
In such a short pulse

1837
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
synchrotron radiation

1838
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
A Pulse height is almost 12 defenses

1839
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Akiko Tamaki

1840
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
So this light is very, very strong

1841
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
and in a short time

1842
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
So you can do some work related to time

1843
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Video Programmers basically hope to use X-Ray to cover

1844
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
to compensate for high-resolution, very high-resolution gaming

1845
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
What can be done with general medical imaging

1846
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
i was hoping to talk

1847
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I see like this when we should stop

1848
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Because each of these is an example of my own development

1849
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
i just told you

1850
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
maybe today i know this maybe probably enough

1851
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
this is caused

1852
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I feel like if I had a light come in

1853
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
there is an edge here

1854
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
you will deflect the light slightly

1855
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
so you're going to make this edge look like it's not

1856
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
If it was here, it would have absorbed so much

1857
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Here now it has a little bit of contrast

1858
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
But after this part like this

1859
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
After the change, the contrast will be stronger

1860
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,320
Here is an example of a practical calculation

1861
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,000
Then you can see that this is the actual image

1862
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,400
When I have a something like

1863
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,400
Here will produce very bright bright text

1864
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,320
then i have one

1865
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,200
demonstration

1866
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,300
like this is

1867
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,300
these are two rays

1868
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:18,600
you can see it this distance

1869
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,900
When the distance from the detective is getting longer and longer

1870
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:21,960
this edge will

1871
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,800
at one stage it becomes very apparent

1872
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,300
like this

1873
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,300
After a long time, it began to blur again

1874
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,700
This is the most suitable time in its midst

1875
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,500
It is very powerful to use it as an image.

1876
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,500
if you could have seen me go back to the beginning

1877
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,000
at the very beginning

1878
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,500
You see, the edge is actually faint

1879
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,300
you can't see

1880
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,500
But just taking this image alone

1881
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,200
This sample and your image

1882
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,400
Whether it's negatives or not

1883
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,400
CGD is also good

1884
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,600
pull it away

1885
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,400
You can see its image slowly coming out

1886
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,100
that's what we're talking about

1887
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:57,200
One of the best demonstrations of Face contact

1888
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,100
For example, at one centimeter

1889
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,000
it will see very well

1890
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
It's clear that even these shafts in his middle

1891
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
can see clearly

1892
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
what's so important about this

1893
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
It's when you see your x-ray in the hospital

1894
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
that radial it will make you cling

1895
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
The reason for the tight fit is simple

1896
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I have one of these light sources today

1897
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
X-ray is a shadow graph

1898
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
just look at the shadow

1899
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
so i put my hands here now

1900
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
light source like you now

1901
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Your edge must not be...

1902
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
But if you go outside

1903
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
if you go to see the sun

1904
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
you are so chic

1905
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
have you ever wondered why

1906
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
It's because the light source is too diffuse

1907
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
because it borders

1908
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
There are photos here

1909
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
So you can draw straight lines

1910
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
you'll know it's edge

1911
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
will be fully illuminated

1912
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
So say this way

1913
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
That is to say, even if you are on the edge

1914
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
have this strengthening effect

1915
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
also be affected by the poor quality of your light source

1916
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
wash it off

1917
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
so at this time

1918
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
that is usually

1919
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
You want it to be brimless

1920
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
you hope higher

1921
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
so you can watch

1922
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
My shadow is getting clearer and clearer

1923
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
By this time the edges are clear

1924
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
then it is very simple

1925
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
You can know this geometry

1926
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,300
then we now

1927
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,300
But the problem is that we were just talking about

1928
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:07,300
This refraction is also different

1929
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,800
refract me when a thing passes by

1930
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,800
Its refraction is to deflect this angle

1931
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,800
is the difference in your refractive index

1932
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,000
Into justice

1933
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,700
at small angles

1934
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,200
So its refractive index

1935
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,300
This S light all things

1936
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:21,300
There is very little difference with air

1937
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,000
is the square of ten

1938
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,700
is the refractive index of its air

1939
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,600
if one

1940
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,900
has the refractive index of water

1941
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:30,900
We are 1.0001

1942
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:36,900
One ten-thousandth of 0.99994

1943
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,900
or one in a hundred thousand

1944
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,900
So denoting its deflection pilot

1945
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,900
you now make a ball

1946
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:43,900
a water ball

1947
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:44,900
or a glass ball

1948
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:45,900
When this S light passes through

1949
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:48,900
It deflects at a very, very small angle

1950
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:51,900
But we want to see its edge imaging

1951
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:52,900
what are you going to do

1952
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:53,900
very simple

1953
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,900
I will pull the distance away

1954
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:58,900
Originally it was this deflection, this Chen Xiaolou

1955
01:10:58,900 --> 01:10:59,900
pull it away

1956
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,380
Zoom in on the resolution of my detector

1957
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,580
start can catch say

1958
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:08,220
I have light and dark spots on the edges

1959
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:12,180
The shape of the whole thing will be highlighted

1960
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:14,580
But if you don't have a good light source

1961
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:15,460
you have a problem

1962
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:17,620
You zoom out and your image becomes blurred

1963
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:19,620
it washes the edge off

1964
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:21,620
So this is why we now

1965
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:23,620
we are what we are

1966
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:25,760
I was talking about this Face Country ten years ago

1967
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:26,960
We also had a press conference

1968
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,340
At that time everyone asked me

1969
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:30,920
When can Face Country be used in the hospital?

1970
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,420
let's say five years

1971
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:33,920
It's been ten years now

1972
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,920
You're asking me maybe I can still talk for five years?

1973
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:38,720
that is to say, where is the reason

1974
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,420
That is, we except the synchronous subsidiary

1975
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:41,920
Besides such a good light source

1976
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,920
I can't find any other substitute students

1977
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:45,920
I just told you that

1978
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,920
I am actually our light source

1979
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,500
The first is that it requires collimation to be a bit

1980
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,500
We only need its light source to be small enough

1981
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,220
So today I put a

1982
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:56,420
put in a fight

1983
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,500
put it on an open eye put it on

1984
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,920
This light source is like a point

1985
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
You can see that the edges will be very clear

1986
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
The only problem is when you put

1987
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
You have no intensity, you have no light

1988
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
light becomes a little bit

1989
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
The advantage of synchrotron radiation is that

1990
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
My light source is very small but it's very collimated

1991
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
is that I can send one like we do now

1992
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Our light source represents 100mc

1993
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
as thick as hair

1994
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
placed 30 meters away

1995
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
When you look at it with the naked eye, it looks like a point light source

1996
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
But it sends the light to you when you need it

1997
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
it won't spread

1998
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
You can think of me if a single point light source

1999
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
It is 1 over R squared

2000
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
It says to follow the distance of R

2001
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
When you walk 30 meters away, it’s already gone

2002
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
this is what we've been waiting for

2003
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
hope you say there is a good light source

2004
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
this has always been

2005
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Many people have always thought

2006
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
can be done in this way

2007
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
but we waited so long

2008
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Actually quite disappointed

2009
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
That is to say, now

2010
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
so far very few

2011
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
This is an example

2012
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
That's what they do with hair radiation

2013
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I have separate comparative

2014
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Just do a separate five-party photography

2015
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
what difference would you make

2016
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
this is not

2017
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
It is conventional

2018
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Tradition

2019
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
This is done with face contrast mammography

2020
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
you can see

2021
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Of course, this place also stands out

2022
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
It's not because of its Western state differences

2023
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
This is made by a Japanese Konika

2024
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
They are also called face contrast mammography

2025
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
but this

2026
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Has not been used by many people

2027
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
we're asking general practitioners

2028
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
They don't even know it exists

2029
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
so i was thinking

2030
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
is the benefit it may get

2031
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Not as much as they advertise

2032
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
So doctors don't have much interest in doing this

2033
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
The face contrast mammography

2034
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Let me give another very simple example

2035
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
like this

2036
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
this is

2037
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
This is the heart of a mouse

2038
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
a part

2039
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
at this distance

2040
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
you look like

2041
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
In fact, so-and-so tiger

2042
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
this black place

2043
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
is inside its heart

2044
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
we specifically make it

2045
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
This structure that grows lidification

2046
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
capping structure

2047
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
just to come

2048
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Simulate this non-coming situation

2049
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
because the mice didn't come in

2050
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,600
Although you use its breast cancer cells

2051
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,200
But you can't grow breast cancer like a human

2052
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,800
Therefore, it cannot be used as an example of video

2053
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,400
But here we do

2054
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,300
with different distances

2055
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:12,000
You go to see me just to distance you

2056
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,100
You can look at these structures and suddenly run out

2057
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,600
see clearly

2058
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:20,100
Then this is the biggest benefit of doing this Face Contrast

2059
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:20,900
like this too

2060
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:23,000
You see, after the distance is extended

2061
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,600
its image is very clear

2062
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,300
For example, what I just said just now is that

2063
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,900
You can see that these two are actually poor in contrast.

2064
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:30,600
not so much

2065
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,000
But because of the efficiency of refraction at the edges

2066
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,200
After the effect, you can see its edge very clearly

2067
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,800
Then you can see that we use this way

2068
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,700
You can see this bubble above

2069
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,000
In fact, it is the structure of the metal that grows

2070
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,500
because it has metal connections with electrical connections

2071
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,400
ok

2072
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:51,000
Okay, the rest of the following are some demonstrations

2073
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,400
Then here are some comparisons we made with fossils

2074
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,500
not much relationship

2075
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,300
But the business name is important

2076
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:59,200
So Polish is in Size

2077
01:14:59,200 --> 01:14:59,700
ok

2078
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,760
Here's another job we did

2079
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,040
even it was a long time ago

2080
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:09,340
Fossil of this embryo from 540 million years ago

2081
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:12,440
Then this is our relationship with Professor Li Jiawei of Tsinghua University

2082
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,120
when cooperating

2083
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,680
He said he found a lot of these sheds in here

2084
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:17,640
this is a fossil

2085
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,880
this fossil is small

2086
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,440
Because it's an embryo kind of like that Kentin

2087
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,480
For example, when the coral is spawning,

2088
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,880
Then this is in the southwest of the mainland

2089
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,680
That is when the geological movement

2090
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:29,880
may be spawning in this

2091
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,760
Others suddenly the earth's crust becomes passive

2092
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,760
all frozen in time by all these things

2093
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,600
come out like this

2094
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,960
Then the size of this one is about

2095
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,760
550.5 This is useless

2096
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,080
OK then we did a lot more

2097
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,880
early days

2098
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:48,960
Like this fly head

2099
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:49,960
I put it where we say

2100
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,880
Because this is actually a beautiful picture of clam worms

2101
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,280
That is to say, the whole head of a fly

2102
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,680
you can tell it's inside

2103
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,800
So I have the structure of the first detail

2104
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,960
But like this we can

2105
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,860
Reconstructed tomography

2106
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:05,120
you can see his head very clearly

2107
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,720
But you say it's nothing

2108
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,220
with this electron microscope

2109
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:10,220
You can see clearly with this scanning electron microscope

2110
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:11,960
But what the SEM can't do is

2111
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,500
he can't see inside yet

2112
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,460
So we can reorganize

2113
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:16,220
we can do whatever

2114
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:17,860
because it's a model

2115
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:18,620
Although this is a model

2116
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:20,160
This is a very accurate model

2117
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,560
It is the model with the same resolution as yours

2118
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:23,460
after you make it

2119
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,220
you can go in any direction

2120
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:27,460
Just like you did this tomography in the hospital

2121
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:30,060
you don't need to stay there anymore

2122
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:32,060
From now on, he keeps looking at this picture of him

2123
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:35,060
He can find where he wants to look

2124
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:36,560
ok

2125
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,560
there's some of this

2126
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,060
ok

2127
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,260
wow

2128
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:44,660
Then I won't talk about how I did it

2129
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:45,960
I'm in this now

2130
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,060
we have to advertise

2131
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:50,260
We're going to do a good resolution

2132
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:51,160
I just said that

2133
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,560
video like this

2134
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,660
Your resolution is up to you on this catapult

2135
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,060
today i will take this with me

2136
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:59,860
Take a CCD to do it

2137
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,200
It shines at this time, because your light has a very short wavelength

2138
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,700
I just said that after the light passes through

2139
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:09,140
This image does not cause resolution issues

2140
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:12,000
But at this time the resolution is limited to your detector

2141
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,200
So I take a CCD one by one

2142
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,740
You said above that I am sensitive to S-light CCD

2143
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:21,200
When you go, your pixel determines your resolution

2144
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,700
So today if you talk about this semiconductor company

2145
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:27,000
This CCD can be made into a CMOS

2146
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,800
is this pixel with 20 nanometers

2147
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,700
My resolution is 20nm

2148
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,100
this do s light

2149
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,900
But this can't be done now

2150
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:39,000
Now look at the specifications of your cameras

2151
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,400
About two or three microns

2152
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,300
So this is actually what we do and that

2153
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,900
Then the other way is my S light

2154
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,900
Can't I zoom in on it first

2155
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:51,600
I'll use this detector to pick it up again

2156
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,300
like this

2157
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,600
Because you said I am zooming in

2158
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,200
It will not affect the resolution of your intrinsic itself

2159
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:00,100
Then I am at this time, you are originally a micron resolution

2160
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
If I enlarge the resolution to 20 times

2161
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
i can get 20 times

2162
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
It becomes 50nm 50nm resolution

2163
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
why do you do that

2164
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
The reason is that the S-light Lens is very, very difficult to make

2165
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Because S light penetrates everything

2166
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
it is not pleated

2167
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
You take one through it and it ignores you

2168
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Then you want the other reflective way

2169
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
it's slightly angled

2170
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
it just goes through

2171
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
so it becomes very difficult to do

2172
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
The only device that everyone agrees is better

2173
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
That is, if you are on the bus

2174
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Sometimes there is a magnifying glass behind the bus

2175
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
It looks like a ring

2176
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
That's the Fone Lens we're talking about

2177
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
that part

2178
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
how well that thing is done

2179
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
depends on your resolution

2180
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
The size of its outermost circle is related to your resolution

2181
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
then i just said

2182
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
If we reach the best 15nm

2183
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
that outer circle

2184
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
We want to achieve a line block of almost 20nm

2185
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Then at 20nm it has to be very high

2186
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Because you want to have an effect on S light

2187
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
you are going to build a wall

2188
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,760
For example, a height of 500 nanometers

2189
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,600
But the width of 20 nanometers

2190
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,400
Then you still use gold to fill it up

2191
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,400
So the difficulty of this is very high

2192
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,400
I'd say we've challenged before

2193
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,400
For example, we are supplying TSMC

2194
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,400
I said we TSMC, you can't do this

2195
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,400
Because TSMC they made this device

2196
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,400
Can do ten or twenty nanometers

2197
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:26,000
But its S5 ratio is very low

2198
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
And they do ten or twenty nanometers

2199
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
It's the FaceShift way

2200
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
It can't do Grading

2201
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
That is to say, I can't do continuous

2202
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Twenty empty twenty results like this

2203
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
It can only say I do a big one like this

2204
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Edge I can do it well done it becomes like that

2205
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Then the device made is

2206
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
because we have a really nice nike process inside the lock

2207
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
that this is this is a

2208
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
that is to say we are saying

2209
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Rarely have this one this in the whole world

2210
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
A department like this can look like this

2211
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,400
equipment like this

2212
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,980
then we are lucky too

2213
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:04,880
There is this thing to support us

2214
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,480
So we made this Device like this

2215
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:08,780
Then come as a magnifying glass

2216
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:10,680
This is the magnifying glass of S1

2217
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,580
When this S1 passes by

2218
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:13,780
you use this magnifying glass

2219
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:15,880
Then project it onto this CCD

2220
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,120
Your resolution is

2221
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,120
Divide your resolution by

2222
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,060
your magnification

2223
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:22,360
Then make this Device

2224
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,660
I just said like this

2225
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:24,960
This is the outermost circle inside

2226
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:25,760
smallest possible

2227
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,260
We can do 20nm

2228
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,300
Its height is 450nm

2229
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,700
Then this is with gold seat

2230
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,900
Because the absorption of gold is the strongest

2231
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:35,440
Then it's the best time to do it

2232
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,140
just like

2233
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:40,040
This is a Lens that looks like this

2234
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,980
to make an image

2235
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:44,820
Like this is our test

2236
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:46,780
What a pattern test looks like

2237
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:48,860
the innermost one

2238
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:50,260
each of this structure

2239
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:53,220
is this interval of 30nm

2240
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:55,260
So we can clearly see

2241
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:56,860
means that our resolution

2242
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:58,900
Should be better than 30nm

2243
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,100
So we did another

2244
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
His test is like we made a structure ourselves

2245
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
The innermost is 20nm

2246
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,500
You can see that this is actually a good result

2247
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,000
It's good to be able to parse it out

2248
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
It means that our resolution should still be better than 20nm

2249
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
So we put a lot of effort into doing

2250
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Finally decided to say that we look at it with a different structure

2251
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Let's look at his analysis

2252
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
calculated in a strict way

2253
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
So our resolution is about 16nm

2254
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
16nm

2255
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,000
This means that we are doing X-ray like this now

2256
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Still no one can do a structure like this

2257
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I give an example

2258
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
We originally published an article a while ago

2259
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
We actually started doing this structure in 2006

2260
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Resolution from earliest to last

2261
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Come down from the secular generation, the Mishi, and the eleventh degree

2262
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
We can do it for about 16 years now

2263
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
In fact, since this

2264
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
In fact, we are of course proud to say that

2265
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
from this onwards

2266
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
a world structure

2267
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,600
it no one can do like this

2268
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,440
So we used the equipment of the middle actor all the way

2269
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,240
do it now we are

2270
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,100
Now we can do this to the extent that this has become

2271
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:10,500
OK

2272
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:13,400
I'll just skip the part about rice granules

2273
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,800
I'm at the end

2274
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,400
Let me show you a few examples

2275
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,600
I don't explain like this is a

2276
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,800
Let's do a lower resolution version of this

2277
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:23,400
you think

2278
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,400
OK

2279
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:29,300
This is an example of our cooperation with these three Chengan physicians

2280
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:32,200
That is to say, he is studying this long-term kidney disease

2281
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,200
I think you probably know why we study long-term kidney disease

2282
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,500
Because Taiwan is the devil king of kidney dialysis

2283
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:40,700
Kidney dialysis alone will wash away 80 billion

2284
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:43,300
So and most of the reasons are

2285
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:45,300
Go and take those medicines that invigorate the kidneys

2286
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:46,300
Caused

2287
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:46,900
OK

2288
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:49,600
This is a normal small genus of kidney

2289
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,500
You can see it every one of this kidney bulb

2290
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,300
The glomerulus can be seen clearly

2291
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,200
blood vessels are fine

2292
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,000
every one is clean

2293
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,300
so you can see the secret mama

2294
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,700
we can even say

2295
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,000
This whole little one is like this

2296
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,600
Its glomeruli may have seven to eight thousand

2297
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:06,460
But if you say like this example

2298
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:08,800
That is to say, this is a disease they created.

2299
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,000
It's called a long-term kidney disease in this mouse.

2300
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,860
You can see that most of the glomeruli are gone

2301
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:15,300
only a small part remains

2302
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:16,300
because it if not

2303
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,660
the mouse won't live

2304
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:21,100
Most of the glomeruli have disappeared

2305
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,960
It doesn't matter if it is inflamed

2306
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,560
or it is blocked

2307
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,860
Then there are only these water-quality blood vessels in the middle

2308
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:29,560
Contains only a small portion of this kidney

2309
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,760
So it's obvious to tell you

2310
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,820
We can study this way

2311
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:35,260
Otherwise they're going to slice

2312
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,560
After you cut each slice you're going to slice

2313
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,560
look how much it has in it

2314
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:40,860
this thing is troublesome

2315
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:42,320
It's not easy for you to quantify

2316
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,460
Now we do it like this

2317
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:45,820
this tomography

2318
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,560
They agree that they can calculate and say

2319
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:48,620
what condition am i in

2320
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:49,660
what a day it will be

2321
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:50,520
how did it die

2322
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,060
That is, these glomeruli are

2323
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:53,260
dead song by song

2324
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:55,020
Still getting bad one by one

2325
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:56,560
this is doing this to them

2326
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:57,860
this is very helpful

2327
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,160
Another thing we do is look at the nerves

2328
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:06,760
This is our cooperation with the essence-related characters

2329
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:12,040
We hope that the use of S-light can turn silver

2330
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,500
or even the nerves in the mouse

2331
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:17,160
completely by way of tomography

2332
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,300
start it all at once with a neuro hospital

2333
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:21,960
to various links

2334
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:25,260
Go to these Dendrites all at once and get it done

2335
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,700
This project is what we want to send

2336
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:31,500
In fact, the most important skill is not in the technology of S beauty

2337
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,300
Just like what we just said

2338
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,340
how do you dye

2339
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:36,800
How about Administrate your developer

2340
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,000
with your calibration

2341
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,600
This is actually the most difficult

2342
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,140
because we already told you

2343
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:43,140
You just have to dye it so we can see it

2344
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:44,640
You can see its smallest structure

2345
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,300
These little ones are its Dendrite

2346
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:49,440
It cannot be seen in an optical microscope.

2347
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,200
OK

2348
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:55,540
I think I've probably said a lot more than that.

2349
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:57,440
I'll just stop here

2350
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,540
Unless you all are interested in seeing other

2351
01:24:59,540 --> 01:24:59,940
Maybe

2352
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
OK

2353
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
all that's left to do is watch

2354
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Do you have any questions here?

2355
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Just now I

2356
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
First of all, thank you teacher for your wonderful speech

2357
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
The question I want to ask is

2358
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Just like the hand-held laser device that the teacher used to give a speech today

2359
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
You can take a laser light gun with your hand

2360
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
So the laser light can be from such a large

2361
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
What was originally a raw device becomes a handheld device

2362
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Synchronized X-rays and lasers

2363
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
It currently has no way to become minified

2364
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
And what is the reason for the device that is very effective and usable

2365
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Another thing I want to ask is

2366
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Just now you mentioned three more times

2367
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
The teacher's team has the world's first technology

2368
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
But just now in your slideshow

2369
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
You also mentioned that these devices are finally used

2370
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
It's all like a touch

2371
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
or some commercially available equipment

2372
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
what's the reason

2373
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Said that other units that can also buy these devices

2374
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
they can't do these things

2375
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Teacher He can do this

2376
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
I think the latter question

2377
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
what i say is what you say

2378
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
That is to say, his optical Lens

2379
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
This fact is

2380
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
If you say yes, no one else will do it

2381
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
only we will do

2382
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
it's a little stretched

2383
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
We can only say that others are too lazy to do it

2384
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
or no one else wants to do

2385
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
In fact, I will tell our own students

2386
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
The biggest reason is

2387
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
we have no one else

2388
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
others can buy

2389
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
but others

2390
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
For example, TSMC has similar

2391
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
This Evil Writer

2392
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
But his job is very fixed

2393
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
i am a friend

2394
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
He originally started this company

2395
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Just do this S-Wang Shen Wei Jing

2396
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
I tell him

2397
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
you can't compete with us

2398
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Why

2399
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
because you are a company

2400
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
you want to profit

2401
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
i bought something

2402
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
even if you do the same thing

2403
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
he wants to count

2404
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
So they didn't buy it themselves

2405
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Evil Writer

2406
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,280
he borrowed this one

2407
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,320
he's in california he borrowed this

2408
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:04,600
Use this E-BING RIDER

2409
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,400
one thousand dollars an hour

2410
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,220
because this is the machine

2411
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:11,780
When Zhongyuan Industry first bought it,

2412
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:14,080
Hundreds of millions soon

2413
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,400
that for us

2414
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,200
I just said you know we last year

2415
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,480
Thousands a year

2416
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,240
we use

2417
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:24,060
6 to 7 thousand hours

2418
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,860
So only used in E-BING RIDER

2419
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:26,880
you buy outside

2420
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,420
so i say you can't compete

2421
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:30,980
Because this is what we are doing research we

2422
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:34,320
The thing is here, we don't need to think about it every day

2423
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:34,820
I use

2424
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:38,920
So we are not saying that it takes 6,000 an hour to make this device

2425
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,500
But we spent a lot of energy from 0 to nothing

2426
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,540
to learn

2427
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:49,660
It's all these young people who go in slowly and cover their whole body, and then go slowly to fiddle with it.

2428
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:51,200
None of this can be taught

2429
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,260
touch it out so it can be done

2430
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:54,280
so this is

2431
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:56,840
I think this is where you say why we

2432
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:57,860
pretty sure

2433
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:59,860
no one is doing it now

2434
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,540
do like us

2435
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:03,160
because when you do

2436
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:05,240
It's easy for the people behind to do it

2437
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,240
When we first started doing

2438
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,960
That is to say, at 100nm

2439
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,240
when i was a graduate student

2440
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,640
We know this kind of device

2441
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:13,540
We never thought to say that today S1

2442
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:15,340
Can do 100nm

2443
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:17,340
I said where is that possible?

2444
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:19,540
but why we do it

2445
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:21,300
Because people have already done it

2446
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,440
when people have made

2447
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,200
it's easy when you're doing

2448
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:27,000
you know it will work

2449
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,240
Then when we make it

2450
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,480
Our students are interested in

2451
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,480
young people are interested

2452
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,780
He kept touching and touching

2453
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:35,280
I found that the more I did the better, the better I did it

2454
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,280
this is

2455
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:39,980
The other one is that you have something to play with you there

2456
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:41,280
so this is

2457
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,180
maybe that's kinda

2458
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:44,680
does not match the cost

2459
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:47,480
If it were the vice president today, tell me

2460
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:50,580
You see you spend $6 million a year

2461
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:51,580
do this thing

2462
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:55,080
As a result, none of them were sold.

2463
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:58,080
then there is no way to do it

2464
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,080
and the front is

2465
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,600
I think it's because of the intractability of X-ray

2466
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:09,000
Even if you have a laser, you usually also have a resonance gun

2467
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
you need this thing in it

2468
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,600
I want to oscelate and resonate in it

2469
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,600
This X-ray doesn't have it

2470
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,600
I'm getting a metal box now

2471
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,600
It goes out with a swipe

2472
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:24,200
and now it uses shreds, they now use electrons to go

2473
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:29,600
make it some coherence

2474
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,600
For example, after my electron comes in

2475
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,600
I use a magnetic field to make it go to the module

2476
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,600
The magnetic field module will slowly lose together

2477
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:39,600
After inputting together, it interacts with electrons

2478
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,600
it ends up having some coperance, some coherence

2479
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,600
In the end they all feel that they shine together

2480
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,600
At this time, the light is a bit like a laser.

2481
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,600
That part, this is where they are

2482
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:54,600
Everyone is thinking, what Stanford did in the beginning was a few kilometers

2483
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:58,600
plus the one shot of free electrons made in Europe

2484
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,600
it's five kilometers

2485
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,400
The 700 meters that Japan is doing now

2486
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:05,600
Then Switzerland and South Korea may be 200 meters away

2487
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:10,200
So I was thinking that if it is possible to achieve 100 meters or 50 meters

2488
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:14,000
But it's hard to do it this way

2489
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
like this

2490
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,600
How can TSMC still try to accumulate iron from the CCP?

2491
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:34,200
Which step does Taiwan not understand or do not know how to do?

2492
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:39,600
Why do you have to buy some trial product material from the CCP?

2493
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,200
interaction first

2494
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:45,600
I haven't researched this, so I can't just talk about it

2495
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:52,600
But I think if TSMC's technology is the best in the world

2496
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:57,200
I think Director Yang may know better

2497
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:00,200
So they went to buy from the CCP, I think it may be the only one

2498
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
One reason is that it is cheaper

2499
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,720
yeah i don't think so

2500
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:07,720
OK, of course the Chinese Communist Party has

2501
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:11,520
When I often go to the mainland, I find that there are many of them

2502
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:13,760
For example, the SWET detector I just talked about

2503
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,080
No. 3 they also do

2504
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:17,280
Infrared detector they also do business

2505
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,280
But you can't tell they're selling

2506
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,280
These are military industries

2507
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,780
this they all

2508
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:24,620
But other than this for commercial use

2509
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:26,620
They have nothing better to do than use

2510
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:29,620
so they are giving

2511
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:31,620
I don't think there's anything to worry about

2512
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:33,620
they buy our stuff

2513
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:36,620
I'm afraid it's a lot more than I buy from them.

2514
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:44,620
Teacher Wu just mentioned that

2515
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:45,620
The image I want to see the most

2516
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:47,620
Lung cancer detection

2517
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:48,620
introduce that paragraph

2518
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:51,620
Because the question I want to ask is this Scale in Sale

2519
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:52,620
You can also have XX to see

2520
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:54,620
Is there a structure in Sale?

2521
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:55,620
Thanks

2522
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:58,620
Thanks

2523
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,000
This is actually not a very successful work in mice

2524
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Because we were talking about comparison at the beginning, in fact, looking at this Lung is very good

2525
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
You can theorize that we are all pieces of this picture put together

2526
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
In fact, you can zoom in and see very clearly

2527
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
That mouse is actually alive

2528
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
You can see because when we put together song by song

2529
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
jump it and move

2530
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
So look at the rib we didn't even get it right

2531
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
We put it like this on purpose

2532
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
But you can see Lung and the T-shirt outside

2533
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
its texture

2534
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
This is the image of it

2535
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,000
The latter structure looks obviously different

2536
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
And while you have a solid this in here

2537
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Words of dense tissue Tumor

2538
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Logically speaking, it should be easy

2539
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
So there is no processing here

2540
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
that's how we see it

2541
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Show it to the doctor

2542
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Then you can see it in my Circle

2543
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
draw it

2544
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
This is a Tumor we entered to make it grow

2545
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Then you can see like I zoom in white

2546
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
I said you don't know if you can see and see

2547
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Here is a Tumor

2548
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Then you don't know if you can see and see

2549
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
There is a Tumor over here

2550
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,040
Then you can see the very grainy one inside it.

2551
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:06,720
It is because the lungs are lung cannons one by one

2552
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:08,640
Of course it's a lung cannon and we're not here

2553
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:09,600
lung cannon

2554
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,640
but lung cannon it this

2555
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:13,340
How about it

2556
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:15,640
Changed the direction of your light

2557
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:19,040
Come out and make you feel like this swish

2558
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,200
that this is its this

2559
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:23,480
So this is about 3mm

2560
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:26,080
It's still about 2mm for this hall door

2561
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,080
But we can also do this

2562
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:30,080
About 0.7mm hall door

2563
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:30,920
right here

2564
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:33,080
It's actually pretty easy to see

2565
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:37,560
But this paper we always hope to send this

2566
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:38,520
We call it radiology

2567
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:41,960
Just do this method, this, this journal

2568
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:42,920
no one to believe

2569
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:44,800
None of them talk about 0.7mm

2570
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,320
Is this small in people

2571
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:49,160
But the decimal is still quite large

2572
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:50,920
You can see the decimals are not necessarily

2573
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:52,360
you can see in person

2574
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:55,600
Then these journal medical journals are made for people

2575
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,800
He doesn't care about you doing decimal stuff

2576
01:33:58,800 --> 01:33:59,160
yes

2577
01:33:59,160 --> 01:33:59,800
then this is

2578
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,440
We actually put a lot of effort into

2579
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,000
make it as possible

2580
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,600
you can see like here

2581
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,100
This is caused by the face contract

2582
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:08,540
its first its edges are clearly visible

2583
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:10,140
The second is this structure inside

2584
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:12,240
It's not the same as the muscle on the outside

2585
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:13,880
So if there is a

2586
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:15,680
tissue like meat

2587
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:17,340
It's actually easy to see

2588
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:19,380
This doesn't need any processing

2589
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:21,780
I just said that this is called a natural contract

2590
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:24,880
Because the lungs are mostly air

2591
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,840
Part of it is a lung cannon like this

2592
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:28,780
and now you have a lump of meat in the middle

2593
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:30,420
In fact, it is easy to say

2594
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:31,880
easily distinguishable

2595
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:33,280
I can show you

2596
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,580
This is normal

2597
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:37,120
you can see this lung

2598
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:37,920
see quite clearly

2599
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,880
This middle is this heart

2600
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:43,920
This is how we can

2601
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:49,680
The problem with applying it to people is that

2602
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:51,020
still no face contract

2603
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:52,520
There is no hospital yet

2604
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,380
Can we get people

2605
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:56,220
Bring it to Synchro

2606
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:58,380
This Europe has done a lot

2607
01:34:58,380 --> 01:34:59,380
someone made this

2608
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
with aluminum anti-photography

2609
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Then there is this cardiovascular noise

2610
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
All these prove that the imaging of synchronous radiation

2611
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
It's much better than what your hospital did.

2612
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
And not only your quality is better

2613
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
And the Radiation of that Dose will be relatively low

2614
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Even without this comparison

2615
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Then it should be better compared to it

2616
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
then i know that means

2617
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
the only reason that says

2618
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
why not do it in sync

2619
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
that is

2620
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
no doctor will

2621
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
just say ok

2622
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
You want to make an aluminum anti-photography

2623
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Okay, I'll take you to the synchrony

2624
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
we are laughing

2625
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Synchro

2626
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
It looks like a factory inside

2627
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
he was scared to death

2628
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,000
So many Americans they were in

2629
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
when doing a job like this

2630
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
They have to get a special room

2631
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
There's going to be classical music in there

2632
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
people come in to make you comfortable

2633
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
can feel

2634
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
But what they do is a small amount of testing

2635
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
just to prove that

2636
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Synchronous auxiliary radiation as long as the light source is good enough

2637
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
can definitely do this

2638
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
but you get rid of God

2639
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Simultaneous shooting can say think of the way

2640
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,360
go to the hospital

2641
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:05,720
Otherwise, this thing does not have much medical value

2642
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,760
I don't ask for advice

2643
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,680
I am a doctor at National Taiwan University

2644
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,520
I study abroad Hover

2645
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,960
Now is the era of Nano technology

2646
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:17,960
everything is nano

2647
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:20,160
The actual problem is that

2648
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:22,520
which hospital can use this

2649
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:25,560
Is there a Nano Machine now?

2650
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:26,640
There's none

2651
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:28,560
now we are doing the same

2652
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,120
My son is a thoracic surgeon

2653
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:31,280
related factories

2654
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,880
opened by son

2655
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:35,360
This morning also opened the way

2656
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,280
that is

2657
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,560
you are good

2658
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,640
very good idea

2659
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:42,440
Did it actually come out?

2660
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:43,720
which hospital has it?

2661
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:44,560
There's none

2662
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,200
we mean now

2663
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:47,600
None of the hospitals are using

2664
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:48,840
So this is what I say

2665
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:49,680
if you have to wait today

2666
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:51,760
but no one is doing it

2667
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,280
several important companies

2668
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:55,520
G. Phillips Siemens

2669
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:58,160
They all have a research team to do this

2670
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:00,000
The reason everyone gets stuck

2671
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
The technical bottleneck is the same

2672
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
It means I don't have a good enough light source

2673
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Who can you share with today

2674
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
we had thought

2675
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
It is said that someone is selling this small copper cloth radiation

2676
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
We also talked to the hospital

2677
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
For example, when I was with

2678
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Talked to this dean on Ma Street

2679
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
He said that if one or two million dollars

2680
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
not too important to them

2681
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Because of the hospital

2682
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
can be recycled

2683
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
He just sees how many years you pay back

2684
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
You just have to make sure he's better

2685
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
we are sure of this

2686
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
then he can be placed in the hospital

2687
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
they can operate

2688
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Doctors don't treat patients

2689
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
send it elsewhere

2690
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
He said I have a healing device today

2691
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I want to do politics

2692
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
to do this pointed therapy

2693
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Yes there is a place in Taiwan

2694
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
or to the United States

2695
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Some people sent to the United States for treatment

2696
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
no problem

2697
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I can't do video

2698
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,000
That's what we've been doing

2699
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Then these big companies are doing it

2700
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
did not give up

2701
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
It means that there is still hope for this thing

2702
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Then we mentioned it again recently

2703
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,900
This matter is that the Taiwan government began to support

2704
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:06,400
That is to say, I hope Taiwan will do digital S-light

2705
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,100
something different

2706
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:09,500
then we mentioned this

2707
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,900
And now there is also a company

2708
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:14,900
He bought a Swiss brand called Sweet Straight

2709
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:16,700
This is the chairman of Beiyi

2710
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:19,600
Li Zhude and the others went to buy it.

2711
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,200
they want if they evaluate

2712
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:23,700
this thing can do

2713
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:25,700
Then this may be what they will

2714
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:29,400
Then let's say our problem today is

2715
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,100
this dose is too low

2716
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:32,300
not too high

2717
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:33,400
but I am now this

2718
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,600
Buy a small one of this Micro Focus Source

2719
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:36,900
it's good enough

2720
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:38,900
But its Power is too low

2721
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:40,700
You want us to buy a Micro Focus Source

2722
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:42,100
It's not yet

2723
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:44,300
it may be 0. a few watts

2724
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:46,400
so you have to take a chest photo

2725
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,300
you have to take 30 seconds

2726
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:49,900
Then there is no resolution

2727
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:51,100
no resolution required

2728
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:54,200
Human movement, breathing, and heartbeat are useless

2729
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:56,100
So we're going to take this one

2730
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,500
strength pulls it back

2731
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,000
but on the other hand

2732
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,100
because we're going to talk now

2733
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:02,700
If I do joints

2734
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:04,200
Let's move in

2735
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,500
you talk to this woman

2736
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:08,000
just be patient

2737
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
stay a little longer

2738
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
it might still be possible

2739
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,500
That chest can't help

2740
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:14,000
because you actually told you not to breathe

2741
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,300
your heartbeat these

2742
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:16,800
you will vibrate

2743
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:20,000
So this is the only difficulty we know of

2744
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,700
So there is a lot of development on S3

2745
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:24,600
That is to say, this is done by physical people.

2746
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,500
If this is done today

2747
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:29,500
This will go to the market

2748
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,500
any left

2749
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:46,500
may i ask

2750
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:52,000
What is the difference between the so-called winding design imaging and the board design imaging?

2751
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,500
Thanks

2752
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:54,500
OK

2753
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:56,000
Around the imaging tracking device

2754
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
In fact, these two are defraction in English.

2755
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,600
with Sketch

2756
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:03,640
Actually we are doing H3

2757
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:07,140
We still don't know exactly

2758
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:10,240
These two images are actually talking about

2759
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:11,600
if i say i'm talking

2760
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,700
We do image restoration

2761
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:14,740
Actually one thing

2762
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:16,040
Because when we're doing imaging

2763
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:20,400
is the intensity that will emit all the S light

2764
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:21,200
absorb it all

2765
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:22,740
I can use a negative

2766
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:24,800
I can use a camera

2767
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:25,400
get out

2768
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:26,440
But now I say for example

2769
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:28,000
Unfortunately I didn't

2770
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,440
For example, when you hit an object with an S light

2771
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,600
look at the light it emits

2772
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,200
You can't find its connection above

2773
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:37,600
so their progress

2774
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:38,840
Now these S lights

2775
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,360
they can handle

2776
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:43,160
restore it to the way you were

2777
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:44,600
So this includes

2778
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:48,560
Intensity of scattered diffraction and scattered S light

2779
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:49,440
so if you ask

2780
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,700
That is to say, what is the difference between this and the direct image?

2781
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:52,800
what we were talking about

2782
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,040
Radiology means

2783
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,360
I just pass through

2784
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:56,900
I'm directly behind the image

2785
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,600
I don't see it diverge

2786
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:00,100
Diverge directly

2787
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,240
We may when you are doing this radiology in the hospital

2788
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:05,940
You also have to use this grid to divert these S-Proong

2789
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:07,700
Detaly absorb

2790
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:09,240
Don't make the image blurred

2791
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:11,600
You just need to see it straight through it

2792
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:16,640
These two are the main differences

2793
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:20,000
That is almost useless to do with medium

2794
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,040
Because of this needed this destensity

2795
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:28,140
The most important use of this is to be able to make about one structure

2796
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:30,960
今天他們的這個夢想

2797
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:33,700
That is to say, I do n’t grow the protein into a crystal today

2798
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:36,900
I put it in the water capacity and spray it in this light

2799
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:39,860
I solved the protein structure

2800
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:41,140
But just say modern

2801
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:44,260
This is why this world spends so much money

2802
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:47,180
Each of this free electronic machine is spent all the light

2803
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:48,820
They are close to one billion US dollars

2804
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:50,100
The United States spent about 100 million

2805
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:52,620
Europe is one billion euro

2806
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:53,640
One billion euro

2807
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:56,020
This costs so much

2808
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:59,500
The only goal you told them to solve this

2809
01:41:59,500 --> 01:41:59,980
Membrane

2810
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,600
this protein this membrane protein

2811
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,440
Because this thing can't be used

2812
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:08,600
Most membrane proteins cannot be borrowed

2813
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:10,680
so this thing is very important

2814
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:13,080
So everyone is willing to spend the money

2815
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:14,920
But its usefulness will not be

2816
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:16,440
Otherwise like this strong

2817
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:18,720
We can say that we can also go to therapy

2818
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:20,520
let's go in

2819
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:22,160
It is possible to enter this Pulse

2820
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:24,560
Everything around you is destroyed

2821
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:28,720
But this is not for this do this

2822
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:30,720
OK

2823
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:32,720
Eh

2824
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:36,360
Then I surrounded this picture of mine and you have not told you

2825
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:38,520
See how it works from here

2826
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:40,960
no it's not

2827
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,120
This is the normal lung

2828
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:45,560
This is a pig lung cannon

2829
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:48,240
Inside it is its organ

2830
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:50,760
Then we just because the picture is pretty

2831
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:52,760
Back to what I just said

2832
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:54,280
because of your lungs

2833
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:56,720
because we relax the resolution

2834
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:59,160
Just wanted to see the resolution of the whole

2835
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:00,160
actually not

2836
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,640
But you can zoom in you at that time if you watch him with our best resolution

2837
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:06,640
probably like this

2838
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:10,640
At this time, you can see the lung cannons accumulated one by one

2839
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:14,440
So it’s actually the solution because the lung cannon has to hit dozens of microns

2840
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:16,040
So resolution is not an issue

2841
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:19,200
This is just for show

2842
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:23,040
But at this resolution, you can't ask for live

2843
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:37,160
I think Dr. Hu gave us a wonderful and simple explanation today.

2844
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:39,600
So everyone gets something

2845
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,000
i think he is tired too

2846
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,400
everybody look

2847
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:45,240
then we thank him very much today

2848
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:47,200
Thank you all

2849
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,060
you
