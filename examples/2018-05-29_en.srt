1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Thank you.

2
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,860
In the Sensai Academia Sinica, the knowledge-response lecture in May begins.

3
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,100
Please start.

4
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,360
Thank you.

5
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,760
Let's welcome 또An Jun's knowledge experience this month to all of you.

6
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,120
The jury personally from the graduate uzutian

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,420
of Sheg suggestion Department of Roblox goodbye

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Dr. Wu Zhixiong graduated from the Department of Practice, National Taiwan University

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Afterwards, he obtained a master's degree from the Institute of Biochemistry of National Taiwan University

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
National Taiwan University Biochemistry is also co-organized with Academia Sinica

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So it is also the Institute of Biochemistry of Academia Sinica

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Then joined the team of this biochemical institute to do research

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Later came to the United States to study

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Went to Wisconsin Medicine to get a Ph.D. in Medicinal Chemistry

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He was taught by the very famous Charles C.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Then I returned to Taiwan and returned to the Institute of Biochemistry

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The Biochemical Institute was established here in 1995

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The building that can be seen now

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
At that time, Dr. Wu also moved to Academia Sinica

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So from the front in

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,760
After master's degree and after working as an assistant

22
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,240
be a researcher here

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,400
43 years in total

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,240
Now a so-called Special Review Researcher

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,840
Research work without Boss

26
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,040
Mainly the relationship between the structure and function of biochemical molecules

27
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,760
Both small and large molecules

28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,440
e.g. proteoglycans

29
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,640
Thinking of polysaccharides

30
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,000
Boss in fact

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,200
An important field of research is Tang science

32
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Let me tell you that Tang Science is actually a strong point of traditional Chinese medicine hospital

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,000
In fact, it is known in the world that the Chinese Medicine Hospital

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,600
is doing very well in this regard

35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,000
In the hospital of traditional Chinese medicine related to Tang Science

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,600
number of researchers

37
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,000
should be in the world

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,600
When comparing in different universities

39
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,000
should be

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It belongs to Saul, that is, the number of researchers who do Tang science

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In this case, think about talking about this background

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
In the early days, Academician Chuan Li suggested to promote the scientific research of Tang Dynasty

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He suggested Dr. Liu Deyong to be the director of the Institute of Biochemistry

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Then Director Liu also invited to work with Academician Chuan Li

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Japanese professor Jing Miao Enoe came to the Institute of Biochemistry to learn about it

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This is the beginning of some scientific research by Tang

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
At the same time, some researchers

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Of course, later, after the head of Weng District Committee returned to Taiwan,

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It further promoted the research of Tang Science

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It is also difficult for more researchers to invest in this area

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,420
If nothing is lost, even in this field

52
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,120
Be a Pioneer at Academia Sinica

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,420
started doing it very early

54
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,800
The other question is that he gave some international organizations

55
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,160
Also active is very involved

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,620
For example, he often participates in

57
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,800
ACGG stands for Asian Community of Glycobiology

58
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,660
Glycotechnology

59
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,000
And Cylo Glycobiology

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Nesalogy is Tropic Acid

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Our two societies are international societies

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Also done in Taiwan

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Their knowledge should be the conference of the international society

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The other thing to mention is that he is accepting

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Professor InternetWay later

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's a pity that he returned to Japan after retiring here

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Died a few years later

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Before his death, there was a request from Dean Li Quan, Dean Li

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Dr. Wu Shixiong established this foundation for scientific research and education in Taipei City, Taiwan

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He is currently the chairman of the foundation to promote scientific research and education in Tang Dynasty

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So he has many high achievements in research and education

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Today he will share with us the relationship between Tang powder quality and life in the way of popular science

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We welcome Dr. Wu

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you Vice President Li Wu for your introduction

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I have been in Academia Sinica for 43 years

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
From the age of 65 this year, I entered the Institute of Biochemistry, Academia Sinica at the age of 22

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
At that time, the Institute of Biochemistry was at National Taiwan University.

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
until now i

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,460
Frankly speaking, I started doing it as a graduate student.

80
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,340
slowly do it now

81
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,560
I will talk about this topic today

82
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,840
The relationship between sugar molecules and life

83
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,140
I divide this part into four parts

84
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,340
As soon as I get to the first part, I'll cover the basic sugar

85
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,940
The second part will talk about the relationship between sugar and blood

86
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,100
Then the third part will talk about

87
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,700
The relationship between sugar and infectious diseases

88
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,300
The last part of the fourth part is about

89
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,300
our food

90
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,200
What does our healthy food have to do with sugar?

91
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Then I'm going to start with this sugary basic this one

92
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Let’s start with the basic chemical structure of sugar

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,800
Our body is roughly divided into five categories

94
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,000
Materially speaking, we are really like eggs

95
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It is, of course, an enzyme

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Nucleic acid is genetic material

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Our basic concept of sugar quality is

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
it is an energy, an energy it provides

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Fat is mainly related to cell membrane

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Of course, there are many other functions, but they are more related to the cell membrane

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Then there are minerals, inorganic minerals

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Like calcium, magnesium, mushrooms, scales, scales, these are in fact a coordinating agent

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Maybe these enzymes need these minerals to work

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Sugar is more than energy

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
When it is oxidized, it turns into carbon dioxide

106
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Produce ATP, we know that ATP is energy

107
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and structure

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You can see the fiber of some plants

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's just a structure, sugar, those fibers are sugar

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and chitins

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The value of a few kilograms is actually a structure

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The value of a few catties is also the sugar value

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The third part is more complicated

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It can be used as a molecule for cell information transmission

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
cell-to-cell contact

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and your protein

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If you want to send to the synthesis

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
where to send

119
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It also has to have sugar to boot it

120
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
we say basic sugar

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Regular sugar like this is the basic

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Its structure is that it's six carbons

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
twelve hydrogen six oxygen

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But here we call it six-carbon sugar

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Of course there are five-carbon sugars and four-carbon sugars

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But our most basic

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
just plain sugar

128
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
it's one you see this first

129
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
if it was a sugar

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
it has a property

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
One of the most important features is the

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
it easily turns into sugar

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,740
it has fat and protein

134
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,000
egg white some protein is also very easy to water

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Some protein can also not easily water

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,500
like our hair is protein

137
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,000
But our hair is not easy to water

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
what about glucose

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and galactose

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and glucosamine

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,500
This is the OHG replaced by an amine group

142
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
our name is glucosamine

143
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,500
and some dried sucrose

144
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,500
a lot of salt algalose

145
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Of course if there are some changes

146
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:45,500
It is this alcohol that will be oxidized to acid

147
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:51,500
That's of course glucosinolate

148
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
no matter what

149
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Sugar has a very basic

150
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,500
It is itself at the first carbon

151
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
it's a whole acid

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We'll talk about this later

153
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
There are two types of sugar

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Like if you look at glucose and fructose

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Fructose is much sweeter than glucose

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
but in fact

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
it is an isomer

158
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
clearly see this glucose

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It is a full machine

160
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
its on the first carbon

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
it's the whole machine

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
what about fructose

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
it's on the second carbon it's a copper

164
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
so it's copper sugar

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That glucose is a whole sugar

166
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
the main difference

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Just in front of these two carbons

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Everything else is exactly the same

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
that sugar itself

170
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
you can see it in the water solution

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We can draw it as beyond the chain

172
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But what about in aqueous solution?

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
About ninety percent or more

174
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
it will ease

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
it will be more stable

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You can see it slowing down, how to slow it down?

177
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's on the fifth carbon, what about the fifth carbon, what about this

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
will come to attack the second carbon and then become a slow

179
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This will be more stable

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
When it becomes slow and strong, this one

181
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The first one is the first one, what about the carbon that has the authority?

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
it will produce two solid shapes

183
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You can see this OH this marked here

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It can be pictured below, or it can be pictured above

185
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This upward direction is what we call

186
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Upwards, we call it MEDA

187
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
down, we call it α

188
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This is mixed together, generally speaking

189
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
MEDA is relatively stable

190
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So it is in the water, there will be more MEDA

191
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What about this, remember this from now on

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
As we'll see below, how important it is

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,440
this you see how important it is

194
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,480
let's see

195
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,120
this is starch

196
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,800
Starch it is αe4

197
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,800
That is, it is a giant sugar

198
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,240
It relies on αe4 such a direct

199
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,080
just saw this candy

200
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,200
it this first oh it goes down

201
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,400
The gradual formation of sugars is two OH

202
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,240
take off a water

203
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,640
H2O leaves one sugar for two

204
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,240
leave an oxygen

205
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,400
oxygen hand

206
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,080
Because oxygen is the hand of oxygen

207
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,880
go pick up these two egg candies

208
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,280
That starch is αe4

209
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,080
fiber is βe4

210
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,880
In fact fiber and starch

211
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,280
is the equivalent

212
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,960
But its properties are completely different

213
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,640
Simply put, if we humans want to digest this starch, it is easy

214
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,340
But to digest fiber, it's not that hard

215
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:15,840
So generally speaking, if it is something alpha, it is probably easily digested in our stomachs

216
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,000
If you want fibers, you have to be like cows, horses, and sheep, which are anti-removal

217
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,340
It relies on the dimensional organisms in its four positions to decompose these fibers

218
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:37,640
But generally speaking, fiber, if it is, if it is Meta, Meta, it is more of a structural type

219
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:45,140
It belongs to the category. If Alpha is a food type, the score will be slightly lowered, but not absolutely.

220
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,840
Then I just said that sugar is our source of energy

221
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:00,140
What about us, if sugar, if glucose, a glucose, it will be broken down

222
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
decompose into red acid

223
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
First decompose into two cake red acid

224
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Cake red acid is to make three carbons

225
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
then come in

226
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
if aerobic

227
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
it produces a lot of

228
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
energy

229
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That is the process

230
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
is to be in

231
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
inside the body

232
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
do this

233
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
under aerobic conditions

234
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
If

235
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
when there is no oxygen

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
if you go for a sun run

237
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Obviously I can't run anymore

238
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
no, because we probably

239
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
eight minutes ahead

240
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
if you are a frequent runner

241
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
about eight minutes ahead

242
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
about as much dextrose as you can use

243
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
run out

244
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It runs out in eight to ten minutes

245
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
not a player

246
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So if you usually run

247
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Then you want to run next

248
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
but no way

249
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Your oxygen, oxygen replacement, and other abilities are very poor

250
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
you run the next day

251
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
wow, that's a good deal

252
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,400
It's because of lactic acid, lactic acid at the end

253
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,400
will harden it from your blood into your liver

254
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,800
Resynthesized into glucose and reused

255
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,500
What about the other thing?

256
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,600
in the absence of oxygen

257
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,200
it carries on this put

258
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,900
the fermentation that takes place, the fermentation results in alcohol

259
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,700
Ah, if the control is not good

260
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,400
Alcohol is oxidized to acetic acid

261
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,500
For the longest time, it was a thin line away from acetic acid.

262
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,600
what about the other one

263
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,100
I said sugar can be turned into structure

264
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,300
The most obvious is

265
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,200
Substance

266
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,800
The so-called gelatin is derived from the original Xujing

267
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,000
until

268
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,800
crab until

269
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,500
crab shell shrimp shell insect

270
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,700
this appearance

271
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,800
It's all base

272
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Butin is a polysaccharide

273
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,500
It is also VEDA

274
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,700
it is also

275
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,900
Relying on this VEDA 1 4 this way again and again

276
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,900
a linked polysaccharide

277
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,600
What about the only thing that's different about him?

278
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:13,600
He uses N and C glucosamine as a monomer

279
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,600
If it's fiber, he's using glucose

280
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,400
But this one uses N and C glucosamine as monomers

281
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,600
This is what you eat if you eat veggie

282
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,400
I will talk about this later

283
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
So it can be used as a structure

284
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:38,800
So the link is of this Beta E4 is mainly like fiber and a few cents.

285
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,200
it's all structure

286
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,400
There is one more concept I must convey to you first

287
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:55,600
That is to say, you, this candy, you keep directing you, your α E4 E keeps directing and directing

288
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,600
In fact he has his front and rear order

289
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
His 1, his first carbon is connected with his fourth carbon, connected together

290
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
For this, for this, his first carbon was originally

291
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
His first carbon would have had a full product

292
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The whole product is oxidized, it becomes acid

293
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But, if you are a high school student, do you have any reaction now?

294
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
If you have a reaction, do this

295
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Is your sugar reducing sugar?

296
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
What about this, this, this

297
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What about the one on the right, the one on the left, it is

298
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Disaccharides, the one on the left, we call them reducing sugars

299
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It is because he is the first one, on the first carbon

300
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This is not used at all

301
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
but this, this

302
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The one on the right and left is non-reducing sugar

303
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So if one is very long, the other is

304
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
it, if we re-transform, is on my right hand side

305
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
my right hand side

306
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
is the restore side

307
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The non-reducing end is always outside

308
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That

309
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
If enzymes break down sugar

310
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
it is uniform

311
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
almost uniform

312
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
non-reducing

313
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
inward action

314
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
non-reducing end

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Too

316
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
closest outside

317
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
close to the outermost

318
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
wait a minute we will

319
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
talk about this

320
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
sugar

321
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
it's not that simple

322
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
just a single

323
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
it can

324
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
correct

325
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
like starch

326
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
like this chitin

327
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
like fiber

328
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
it can aggregate

329
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
become a polymer

330
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Polymer

331
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
very long molecule

332
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
just a glucose

333
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
it can be straight

334
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It can be connected directly for a long time

335
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
sugar

336
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
it

337
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
can also

338
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
with fat

339
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
glycolipid

340
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
the fat

341
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
We know that if a candy

342
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
This molecule just becomes a very strange

343
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Because fat and sugar are incompatible

344
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
One is clear water, fat

345
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It is polyhydric

346
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So you can see the two words together

347
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You can see that this substance becomes a bisexual substance

348
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Some of it is clear water, and some of it is water

349
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
sorry, let me explain first

350
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
because i'm not a philologist

351
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Nine characters, you can see a lot here

352
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I use nine useful rice and I mix it up

353
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Because I think the two are about the same

354
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Some would argue that the two are not the same

355
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Some people say that you can also use the word "米" next to the things you fill in.

356
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
For things not to be filled in, he can also use the word Nine

357
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But I'm not a philologist

358
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
This may ask this to write text

359
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
text like the historical institute

360
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
protein it can also form elastic

361
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Glycoprotein is very popular

362
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What about our antibodies?

363
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
A lot of about 6-70% protein

364
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
are glycoproteins

365
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I just said that after protein is modified with sugar,

366
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
so that our cells know

367
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Which fixed organ should it be sent to?

368
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Okay, I'm going to look at this now. This is a basic

369
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The basic structure of the basic cell membrane

370
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Then you can see that this side is extracellular

371
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
This is inside the cell

372
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What is this sugar and fat?

373
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What about sugar and fat? Its fat part

374
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Just insert the whole thing on the membrane

375
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's exposed, it's a candy

376
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
oligosaccharide or polysaccharide fraction

377
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
This one by one is sugar

378
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
the outermost

379
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,320
Look at the outermost candy

380
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,840
It is the non-reducing end

381
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,840
We are talking about the non-reducing end just mentioned

382
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,640
Then this is protein

383
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,200
this protein

384
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,560
What about this water-accumulating spiral?

385
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,200
It permeates the entire cell membrane

386
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,360
Then the sugar part is also spread on the outside.

387
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,160
Whether you are glycoprotein or purple Tibetan white

388
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,760
You are on the membrane like this oil slick

389
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,720
The so-called cell membrane

390
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,920
The cell membrane is of course formed by fat

391
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,760
This is a picture of a microscope of a cell membrane

392
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,160
you can see

393
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,920
Its whiskers are glycolipids

394
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,720
Then this black string

395
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,920
This is inside the fat cell

396
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,120
this whole

397
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
this is the cell membrane

398
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What about the hee hee hee part?

399
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
sugar

400
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
every cell

401
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
it

402
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
the appearance of these sugar

403
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
what does it represent

404
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
represent our faces

405
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
erythrocyte

406
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Will it be recycled in 190 to 120 days?

407
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
then we

408
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
how does the body recognize

409
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
This red blood cell is

410
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
old red blood cells

411
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
this is young

412
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
that is by

413
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
This on the outside of this cell

414
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
this candy

415
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Cellular

416
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
sugar outside

417
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
with healthy cells

418
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The sugar outside is different

419
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
old and young

420
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
sugar outside

421
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
so i just said

422
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Glucose cost on the cell surface

423
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
different young

424
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,720
cells are different from brain cells

425
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,320
sick cells vs healthy cells

426
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,320
These sugars outside are not the same

427
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,820
If the blue part of this picture is the protein

428
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,320
The yellow part is the sugar part

429
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,660
you can see

430
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,260
The protein part is very tight

431
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,200
won't move too much

432
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,200
but the sugar part it can swing a lot

433
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,200
That is, sugar molecules are easily fused with water.

434
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Having this sugar may have a lot to do with this protein

435
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,200
protect it or many functions

436
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,200
we'll talk about this later

437
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,200
So for a cell

438
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
this is the nucleus

439
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Those outside are sugar

440
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
or protein

441
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That doesn't matter if your bacteria are coming

442
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
when attacking us

443
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Sugar is the first thing

444
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Viruses come and go

445
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
first to sugar

446
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
cancer cells to metastasize

447
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
he wants to transfer

448
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
cut this off

449
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
and then he was able to run

450
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Or the cancer cells are going to go to a place

451
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
to protect

452
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
he also depends on this

453
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
sugar on top or

454
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
some protein and

455
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
These surrounding cells interact with each other

456
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Contact him to be here

457
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Implantation grows

458
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
become a cancerous tissue

459
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
that or your hormones

460
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
you want to touch

461
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
to stimulate

462
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
to stimulate this cell

463
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
met outside

464
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Possibly protein

465
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
or sugar

466
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
so

467
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
what about this one

468
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
is typical

469
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
cell surface carbohydrate molecules

470
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
exchanging information with the outside world

471
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
important bridge of

472
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,100
Now what, I have to tell you about a protein

473
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,100
This protein is closely related to sugar

474
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,100
lectin

475
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,100
What is lectin?

476
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,100
is that it is a protein

477
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,100
It is a protein or glycoprotein that can bind with sugar

478
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,100
It can bind sugar

479
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,100
When two cells come together

480
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,100
lectin

481
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,100
Lectin is a protein

482
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,100
But its function is to combine with sugar molecules

483
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,100
that's how it is

484
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
How does lectin combine with it

485
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,100
like you see this

486
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,100
cold virus

487
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,100
Either weak energy or some poison

488
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,100
I will give an example later

489
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,100
Lectin is a protein

490
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,100
The function of this protein is to combine with sugar molecules

491
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,100
Thanks

492
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But the power of this spirit number combined with sugar molecules

493
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's combined, this power is not going through the carpool

494
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
That's what we call, it's a second class ship

495
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
That's the power you can't see

496
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
you can measure it, but sometimes

497
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You're probably thinking it's not a real chemical ship

498
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Is it a clear ship or an ion ship

499
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
or ring de valli , or the effect of polyhydricity

500
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Paste together, it will produce two and combine together

501
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
This power is not very strong, but

502
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Phenomena that have dominated our lives since the Lord

503
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Both of these tell us that the combination of the number of spirits and sugar molecules

504
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Relying on the power of this non-common ship

505
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,600
Kiyomi, positive and negative electricity attract together

506
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,800
what about this you can see

507
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,300
When a virus wants to enter our cells

508
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,100
There are some lectin on the virus

509
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
can bind to cellular sugars

510
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
Or the cholera toxin

511
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,400
when it enters our cells

512
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,900
What about the toxin?

513
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,700
it also passes through

514
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,300
sugar that will stick to the cell first

515
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,300
or germs

516
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,000
Lactobacillus

517
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,100
it has a lot of this lectin

518
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,700
It will also deactivate the lectin on the bacteria

519
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,700
will bind to this sugar on our cells

520
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,700
and then into our cells

521
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,900
sometimes like the most famous

522
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,200
like white blood cells

523
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,300
it's going to where we hurt

524
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,000
escape from the blood vessels

525
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,300
what about this time

526
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,000
How does it focus on vascular

527
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,900
The first step also relies on lectin

528
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,840
It's the urgency number on the maintenance tube that attracts it down

529
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:13,320
Then he'll run out to the injured area to fight the foreign intrusion

530
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:20,720
In fact, these are all related to our life and life.

531
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,260
Therefore, it will be easier to talk about the following after the anxious number is finished.

532
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:29,240
In order to let everyone have a better understanding of the number of jitters, let me give you an example

533
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,240
Let me give you an example golden boar protein

534
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:39,240
Have you heard of golden boar protein? This is our academician Lin Rongrong who has done a lot of research

535
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,240
Golden boar protein is quite poisonous

536
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,240
I remember playing with this a lot when I was a kid and its seeds

537
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,240
But it's actually quite poisonous in it

538
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,240
It has a kind of what we call golden boar protein in it

539
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,240
it has two

540
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Divide it into two parts, you see, it finances into the egg white and divides it into two parts

541
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Part of it, let's say A, part of it

542
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Let's call this blue A

543
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Let's call the part of this potential color B.

544
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
A what is it? A is actually an enzyme

545
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
it goes into

546
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
If it enters our cells, it will put

547
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
protein-making machine, glycosome, inside

548
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
RNA breaks it down

549
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
It's quite a lot, but what if

550
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
only A, if you owe

551
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
only A words

552
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
don't read it because it can't get into the cell

553
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
In fact there are many plants that only contain A

554
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
but not toxic

555
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It depends on B, what is B?

556
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
B is that it is a lectin

557
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
A and B are connected by double arrows

558
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
B it will look for sugar on the cell surface

559
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
At once

560
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,560
He is Ningji Sutu, after he combines with him

561
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,880
If it is beneficial to A, enter

562
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,180
just go to this

563
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,780
enters the cells and becomes very toxic

564
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:18,680
This financial strain is actually very similar to that coin toxin

565
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,520
One of the most famous cases was in 1978 when

566
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,140
A reporter from Eastern Europe lived after he escaped

567
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:32,260
The British national broadcaster BBC is a reporter who has been bashing

568
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,100
Bulgaria slams this Russia

569
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,680
Russia's KGB

570
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,740
use this toxin

571
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,320
put it on top of this umbrella

572
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,420
Inject it into this guy while riding the subway

573
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,500
At first he didn't know why he just said it was crowded

574
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,780
What about the toxin?

575
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,060
very fine

576
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,340
Put it in a small iron ball

577
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Just like that, after four days, he died

578
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So this thing is actually very poisonous

579
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So I front these

580
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm done with the basics

581
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I'm going in now

582
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I hope you will be more interested

583
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
What I'm going to talk about next is related to academics

584
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
some stories

585
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
bloody

586
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
There are mud blood, hematopoiesis, diabetes disease

587
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
the blood

588
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
these stories

589
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
you see blood

590
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
bloody

591
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
If before 1900

592
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
No one knows there is type A and there is type AB

593
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
O type

594
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Why

595
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
will find out

596
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's someone who survived a blood transfusion

597
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Someone got a blood transfusion and died from the same blood transfusion

598
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
don't know

599
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,960
1900, 24 seasons ago

600
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,640
No one knows there is type A, there is type B, there is type AB, there is type O

601
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,300
But what about the blood type here?

602
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,080
It is formed on the surface of red blood cells

603
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,460
This is a red blood cell.

604
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,740
Glucose antigens on the surface to determine what blood type you are

605
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,500
you can see type o

606
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,860
What about type O?

607
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,580
Glycoantigen here

608
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,580
Type A, there is one more

609
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,080
This quadrangular one is called galactosamine

610
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,580
one extra

611
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,080
so you type a

612
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,080
What about blood type A?

613
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,580
What about the antigen?

614
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,580
O type no

615
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,580
What about type O antigens?

616
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,580
Look at 1234, this type A is in the process of synthesis

617
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,080
There will also be O-type

618
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,580
So you type O lose to type A

619
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,580
no problem

620
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,580
Type A

621
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,580
Type O you lose to Type A

622
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Does a person with type A have type O antigens?

623
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Type A and Type B cannot belong to each other.

624
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Because type B has one more galactose than type O

625
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
In fact, type A and type B

626
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
one more galactose

627
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
one is galactose

628
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
but this one is different

629
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It’s just that the position where I painted Lanlan is different

630
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It's just that the location is different

631
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
such a small difference

632
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
You type A can't lose to type B

633
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Type B can't lose to Type A

634
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
because it's what you typed in

635
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
it treats it as a foreign object

636
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Such a large amount of foreign matter comes in

637
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
that's worth it

638
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
That person will probably be carbon off.

639
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
So the blood transfusion was wrong

640
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
will die

641
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
But type AB, he has both

642
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Type AB, he also has type A

643
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Type B he also has

644
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Galactose also has

645
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
What about this, so you type A lose to type AB

646
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,400
There is no problem losing to the AV type

647
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
it's all acceptable

648
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
So this is easy to see

649
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,400
You type O can lose to any type

650
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,400
But Type A except itself

651
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,600
It can also only lose to the AV type

652
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,600
it can't lose to type a either

653
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Can't lose to V-type

654
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,200
Like the V-type, it can't lose to the O-type

655
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,600
Can't lose to Type A

656
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,600
But it can lose to AV type

657
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
AV type can

658
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
But its main difference

659
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
i just said

660
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
It is the surface of the red snowball

661
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Glycoantigens to determine your studies

662
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
then you will see in

663
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,200
There was an article in 2007

664
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
a biotech company

665
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
Did he say it was easy?

666
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
I put an enzyme

667
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,200
Cut off the A-type

668
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,800
AV type this cut off

669
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Let's cut it all together and make it all O-shaped

670
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
someone did it

671
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
He cut it off with enzymes and all the blood became type O

672
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
It's very simple.

673
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It's fine if you lose

674
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It was in 2007

675
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
There is an article in Nature about Technology

676
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
In this journal, he mentioned that

677
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
This is also a kind of biotechnology

678
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Sometimes when there is a blood shortage

679
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
You can't find this with this blood type

680
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
They are all type B, so what should I do?

681
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You're also type B, you can't lose to him

682
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You can lose to him, but you can't lose to him

683
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
At this time, take an enzyme and cut this off

684
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's very simple to say, but it should be built with a lot of technology

685
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Okay, we're done with blood types, let's talk about this again.

686
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
red blood cell count

687
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
What about red blood cell count?

688
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
this initial poetic

689
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Let's call it epo for short.

690
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Chinese is called red blood cell production number

691
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
what about this epo

692
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
what is

693
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
because of U.S

694
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
if blood stem cells

695
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
blood stem cells

696
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
it differentiates into red blood cells

697
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
or it differentiates into white blood cells

698
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
or differentiate into platelets

699
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
have to go through hormones

700
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
specific hormone destimulation

701
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
specific hormone

702
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
then if it goes through

703
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
If blood stem cells

704
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
in our bones

705
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
after release

706
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
If by this epo

707
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
red blood cell production

708
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
after stimulation it will

709
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
differentiate into red blood cells

710
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
what about this

711
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
What about the red blood cell count?

712
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
where is it produced

713
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
mostly in our kidneys

714
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Produced in renal myocytes

715
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,500
Dialysis person

716
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,820
would not be able to generate enough

717
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,100
epo blood

718
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,680
So what about people who wash their kidneys?

719
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,420
he will be very

720
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,840
very weak very tired

721
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,060
Because he doesn't have enough red blood cells, he's anemic.

722
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,180
anything else

723
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,520
this

724
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,700
In fact there is something like this

725
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,480
If the retarded man uses

726
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,680
He will also be anemic with medication

727
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,880
that is

728
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,080
not enough red blood cells

729
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,280
at this time

730
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,960
In this epo in 1989, he

731
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,760
by US drug

732
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,240
What about the Food Administration, he will approve

733
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,180
You can come and wash this kidney

734
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,840
to make him

735
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,200
be able to have enough of this

736
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,180
This red blood cell, so I injected this

737
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,880
very good effect

738
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
very good effect

739
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,840
So let me see below

740
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,600
he actually

741
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,480
Epo is a glycoprotein

742
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,680
green part

743
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,680
you will see the green part

744
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,120
just a protein

745
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,040
the colored part

746
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,100
he has four

747
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,900
he has four candies

748
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,700
This one this one is sugar

749
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,800
sugar chain sugar chain

750
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,500
so he is a glycoprotein

751
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,200
he has four candies

752
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,700
those candies

753
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,040
if

754
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,540
Our First Generation Biotechnology

755
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,440
produced

756
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,940
just without sugar

757
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,940
What about this Epo without sugar?

758
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,940
Hit the human body?

759
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,840
Useless

760
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,940
But what about in the lab if you use cells

761
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,440
It can work without hitting the human body

762
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,440
What does this mean?

763
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,940
sugar

764
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,140
these sweeteners

765
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,840
is protecting the protein

766
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,240
That is, if you don't have these sweeteners

767
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,940
protect this outside

768
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Protein, Epo protein, when it hits the human body

769
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
It is easily broken down in the blood

770
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So Epo has glycoprotein

771
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
The stability of this sugar in the human body is related to

772
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
There is a big biotechnology company in the United States called MGN

773
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It produced Epo, and because of Epo, it turned a large group

774
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Become a big factory of biotechnology

775
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,000
In fact, the conversion of the Epo gene was done by Taiwanese Lin Fukun

776
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I checked his, actually from 1975 to 1977

777
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
All jobs at this hospital

778
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Epo has another story

779
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
He was in the Blood Olympics in 2000

780
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,680
declared banned

781
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:08,140
Because the players need to bring more oxygen

782
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,120
so many people hit

783
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,220
just hit a wave

784
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,980
Playing a wave has promoted a lot

785
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,620
He has more red blood cells than you

786
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,020
I can run faster than you

787
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,460
because i have oxygen

788
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,060
he will run faster than you

789
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,560
so why ban him

790
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,020
very dangerous

791
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,940
What we people strive for is a balance

792
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,740
when you have too many red blood cells

793
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,740
will cause blood

794
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,620
high viscosity

795
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,220
Stickier

796
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,260
then you'll break your heart

797
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,220
compression

798
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,220
you a thing

799
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,060
your blood is stickier

800
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,420
your heart's last strength of course

801
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,120
will increase

802
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,660
So some players get killed

803
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,660
It's because of a heart attack that will kill you

804
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,140
So what about social technology?

805
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,240
can be used to save you

806
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
can hurt you too

807
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Technology is always neutral

808
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Next, let me say that it is also a kind of sugar-based medicine.

809
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:18,000
But this glycin is actually an anti-coagulation problem naturally produced in our body

810
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
have you ever donated blood

811
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
What if your blood won't clot when you go to donate blood?

812
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Blood generally clots when it leaves the body

813
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
If your blood leaves your body or yours then you have blood disease

814
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
your blood does not coagulate

815
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
What about when you go to donate blood?

816
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Anticoagulant blood will be put in the blood bag

817
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
For anticoagulation, there may be two types

818
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Sometimes it puts a citric acid

819
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
lower your pH

820
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
glucosinolate

821
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,500
it's a sugar glycine in fact

822
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,500
Glucose is actually a sugar

823
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,500
It is a natural aggregation of this

824
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,500
is that it relies on sour sugar

825
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,500
A lot of sour sugar combined like this

826
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,500
a long long molecule

827
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,500
a sugar molecule

828
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,500
it can be used to treat

829
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
if you have surgery

830
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Deeper blood acid

831
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
The lungs also have blood acid, arterial acid, etc.

832
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
and myocardial infarction

833
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Because myocardial infarction is also the main

834
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
But when glycin itself is used

835
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
There are two most feared side effects

836
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
If the amount used is difficult to control

837
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
it causes internal bleeding

838
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
or your blood is harder to clot

839
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Platelet function will decrease

840
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:12,000
This has happened to many

841
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I know mainland China is separated from pigs or cows

842
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
That is also used in the human body in Gansu

843
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
that happened too

844
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
How Gansu works

845
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
make it blood anticoagulant

846
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It is so anticoagulant in nature

847
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
we can find out

848
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
mosquitoes draw your blood

849
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
If you go to fight mosquitoes

850
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
bloody hands

851
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Mosquitoes have their own anticoagulants

852
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
draw your blood

853
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
The water quality is also in the attraction

854
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
In fact, many

855
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:08,000
The mechanism of this protocol is actually a series of hydrolysis reactions of protein berry

856
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
These meringues are zero blood factor

857
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Protocols that lack either one may not be able to zero

858
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
If you can't zero in on which one are you missing?

859
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Then if you lack it, there is no way for Zero Gu to become blood sick.

860
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
What about Gansu, its mechanism is that our human body has a protein

861
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I'm sorry, I don't know how to do this. I want to translate on my own, but I can't.

862
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It is called antiso-min

863
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
by itself if alone

864
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:52,000
It can be combined with this factor10A this can be combined with it

865
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:00,000
But it is relatively weak, but once this protein is combined with glycin

866
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
It can be combined with this factor10

867
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
become a hundred times stronger

868
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Increase the binding force hundreds of times

869
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So it's possible to block this

870
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Block this cascade of protein berry hydrolysis reactions

871
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:24,000
So it can turn blood into Naya Gu

872
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
The most efficient one right now is

873
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
The most effective is these five candies

874
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
The name of these five candies

875
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I can't find the Chinese name

876
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
terribly sorry

877
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
called fandopalinex

878
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It is a very strong anti-bleeding agent

879
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Vice President Liu just said that

880
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
There are many sugar quality experts in our Chinese Academy

881
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Director of Genome Center

882
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
red top

883
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Director Hong is actually

884
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
it has

885
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
he studies this one

886
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
this one

887
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
this one

888
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
This substance of the five halls

889
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
He studies its synthesis

890
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Research

891
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It seems that there are many patents

892
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It seems that they are planning to start a company to do this.

893
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
In fact this thing

894
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
it can replace dry element

895
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Then what

896
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
If you after surgery

897
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
cause arterial thrombosis

898
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
it can be clear

899
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Then for acute coronary

900
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
It is better than traditional dry vegetarian

901
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
this

902
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
It is a very important medicine

903
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
now everyone wants to make it

904
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
synthesized

905
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Then you can use many

906
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
not just medicine

907
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Then when you donate blood, you can also put some

908
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
ok let's see now

909
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Diabetes mellitus this generation is also more

910
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,240
My blood sugar is also relatively high, so I pay more attention to this

911
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,000
This diabetes disease is really scary

912
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:11,080
Will your eyes be blind? Will your kidneys be damaged?

913
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:14,520
high blood sugar

914
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,580
Why is it hurting so much? He hit all of this.

915
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,780
Organ why?

916
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,080
I just said he's a circular and straight lover

917
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,600
Straight love has a punch on it as long as there's a punch

918
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,000
This is protein

919
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
If there is an amino group, he will box with the amino group.

920
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
it's easy to become a suction test

921
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Just call up, it's okay to check

922
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It's delicious, but it sucks if

923
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,000
If it takes a long time, he will become a non-greasy, non-greasy word

924
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,800
What about the glycoprotein?

925
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It will be elasticized. If it is elasticized too much, it will gradually lose its function.

926
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Eyes will go blind if you drink

927
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,600
Drink A wine, you drink A wine, drink methanol

928
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,600
Methanol becomes methanol in our body

929
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:12,300
You drink, you alcohol, it's alcohol, it's okay

930
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,900
It's okay to drink methanol

931
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,200
That's because, Yichun

932
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,000
It can always be oxidized to acid

933
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,700
But methanol can only be oxidized to methanol

934
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,200
Methanol is so poisonous, why?

935
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,600
Because it is the total product

936
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,100
With full product, you can beat any egg white

937
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:38,600
So drink alcohol, methanol, you will go blind

938
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,300
That's the whole problem

939
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,100
Methanol, mainly the total product

940
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,700
so you can see

941
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,400
If diabetes is sick, because we human beings

942
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,400
I just talked about protein, it has a certain

943
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,100
If your protein is old, it will be recycled

944
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:59,500
If your protein recovery rate is greater than

945
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Destruction rate Your protein will be destroyed

946
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Then you are normal, you are normal

947
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
But what if you get sick from diabetes?

948
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Because of you, your destruction rate

949
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
bigger than this

950
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
recycling rate that

951
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
then you just

952
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
no way, you are

953
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
like us at my age

954
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
if compared with younger

955
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
My Protein Recovery Rate

956
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
far inferior to you young man is

957
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
All aspects of him are comparisons

958
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Recycling rate, regeneration

959
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
This recycle we all

960
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
The so-called recycle is stronger

961
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
well there like

962
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Medication for type 2 diabetes like these

963
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
This drug is of course a sugar molecule.

964
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
He is the will to decompose the beauty of starch

965
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
It's all about decomposing starch

966
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,400
just suppress it

967
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,700
Now we break down the brow is what we call

968
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,000
Alpha Valley Sides

969
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,200
so suppress it

970
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,200
what about this

971
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,200
Most of this medicine is what you eat

972
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,900
food money

973
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,600
eat in a few minutes

974
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,600
So the medication for type 2 diabetes

975
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,500
some are also

976
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,800
molecules of sugar

977
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:33,800
Okay, so now I'm going to tell you a story about this infectious disease.

978
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,800
Infectious diseases are actually the same in all countries

979
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,800
Encountered an infectious disease

980
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,800
The policy of the first country is like this

981
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,800
The most important thing to fight is the cold

982
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,800
The first one was terrible because of the cold

983
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,800
historically horrible

984
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,800
let's see

985
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,800
this is in

986
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,800
This picture happened in the United States in 1918

987
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,800
just the first time

988
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
when the world war is coming to an end

989
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Spanish tourism at this time

990
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Invasion of the world is in the hands of the United States

991
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
this time

992
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Hospitals, businesses, cities are all infected

993
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
So at that time

994
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It was March 1918

995
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
This sense of tourism but living in the United States to see women's health in Saz State

996
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Then slowly expand to every corner of the world

997
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:33,000
At that time from March 1918 until June 1920

998
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I don't know why it disappeared

999
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
But at least 20 million people died

1000
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
this is horrible

1001
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Some even say hundreds of millions

1002
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
close to 100 million

1003
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
At that time, medical technology was not so advanced.

1004
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
But back then, people's brains were pretty powerful.

1005
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
He used the patient's specimen with spicy

1006
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Crazy save

1007
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
After hot crazy save

1008
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So, in 2004, scientists reconstructed this flu virus

1009
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Proved he was a H1N1 flu

1010
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I'm going to talk about what is H and what is N

1011
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I saw it in your report.

1012
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
HN H1N1 what is H what is N

1013
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I'm going to talk to you about this now

1014
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
What is H?

1015
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
H is sialyl lectin

1016
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Its name is Hemagutinin

1017
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
it is a lectin is a protein

1018
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
is a protein on the surface of cold viruses

1019
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:51,000
N is sialidohydrolase

1020
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
its a beer sugar

1021
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
beer is sugar with beer

1022
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:08,520
The acid is almost gone forever, forever at the ring end of the flying ring

1023
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,200
That is, the outermost part of the cell sugar

1024
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:21,320
So when the lectin of the virus suddenly ran to our respiratory tract

1025
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:25,360
The first thing that happened was he went to the stripper again and glued it on

1026
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:32,680
So stick it on, this is the first step for the cold virus to enter the cell

1027
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:40,240
It's a lectin. As I just said, lectin can bind to sugar.

1028
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:48,680
It's going to find it, it's a protein, it's in the cold virus

1029
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:54,120
These are proteins on the outside of the cold virus and genetic material on the inside

1030
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:59,160
Its genetic material is RNA not DNA it is RNA

1031
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Outside, there are two very important proteins

1032
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
One is H which is the lectin of dehydrating acid

1033
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
one is N

1034
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
N is a dehydrating acid hydrolase

1035
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
This is the H?

1036
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
This protein is used to enter cells

1037
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
The N is to leave the virus after soaking into the cells

1038
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
After copying, when it is about to leave

1039
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Use N to cut off the dehydrating acid

1040
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Cut off the dehydrating acid it's of course fine

1041
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Otherwise, I'll tell you later

1042
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
What is the use of this and what is the use of these two

1043
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
This is dehydrating acid

1044
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
What about dehydrating acid? I just talked about it.

1045
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Glycolipid molecules usually on the outside of cells

1046
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And it's at the reducing end of the lung, which is the outermost

1047
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
So what about cold viruses like ours

1048
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Cold virus comes from our respiratory tract

1049
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
nose, this, this

1050
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
as soon as it comes

1051
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Check for dehydrating acid, if there is, it sticks

1052
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
ok look at this picture

1053
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,000
When this H, there are a lot of H outside, this is a virus.

1054
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,000
What about the virus, it found us, this, this is a human cell

1055
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Viruses are of course much smaller than human cells

1056
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
But it's the first one, it's attached to this dehydrating acid

1057
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It's attached to this dehydrating acid. Look for it.

1058
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Then it slowly enters our cells

1059
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
When it enters the cell, it controls our entire cell

1060
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Tell our cells to do a lot of confinement of this cold virus

1061
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
It will do a lot, become controlled by it, and do it all

1062
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And then break down the cell

1063
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Spread the power of this virus out

1064
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
to infect more cells, so we'll produce

1065
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,000
When it is about to leave, this N I just mentioned

1066
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
It is a hydrolase of lyrenic acid

1067
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It will cut the cell above it and cut it off

1068
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Otherwise it won't get out it will stick to this

1069
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
This production of our cell breakdown

1070
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
it's glued on so it won't get infected

1071
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,000
So this N, so H and N are related to torenic acid

1072
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
One, H is the rapid number of torenic acid

1073
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:42,000
It can stick to it. N is the hydrolase of the acid

1074
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,000
We all know that we know about the gag flu

1075
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
People who have taken the flu have heard that it is very effective

1076
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,000
In fact, if you eat it on the real machine, your cold will heal very quickly.

1077
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Why

1078
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,720
But what is the flu?

1079
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,560
What about the flu?

1080
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:04,860
it is

1081
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,000
What about the flu? It's a cold virus.

1082
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,400
This N is an enzyme

1083
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:15,760
This N is an enzyme that hydrolyzes stripping acid

1084
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,200
its inhibitor

1085
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:20,200
It suppresses the function of this N

1086
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:26,160
Reduce the ability of the virus to spread

1087
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,360
It can be seen that the gram flu is

1088
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,360
Rosu medicine

1089
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,360
it is eaten

1090
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,360
what about the other one

1091
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,160
What about another medicine?

1092
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,160
Gran vegetarian sausage

1093
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,160
it is sprayed

1094
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,160
It's because the medicine is like this

1095
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:52,160
If your medicine is too watery

1096
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,160
eat it

1097
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,160
It didn't take long to get rid of it

1098
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,160
you eat

1099
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,800
B vitamins are water soluble

1100
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,300
you eat for about a few hours

1101
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,700
It's yellow when you pee

1102
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,500
This is clear water

1103
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,500
So stay longer

1104
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,700
You need to be more watery

1105
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,000
passenger flu

1106
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,200
This whole structure is relatively water-accumulating

1107
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,400
it can be eaten

1108
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,100
This water is relatively strong

1109
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,300
it is sprayed

1110
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,000
let's see

1111
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,400
If there is guest flu

1112
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,400
it puts N

1113
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,300
this N

1114
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,200
when its function is inhibited

1115
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,800
if you don't have guest flu

1116
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,000
you can see

1117
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,800
This is a little bit dark

1118
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,700
It's a little dark

1119
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,200
cold virus

1120
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,800
cold virus

1121
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,600
it's in this cell

1122
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,600
keep growing

1123
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,200
Then what

1124
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,600
grow to the end

1125
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,100
burst this cell

1126
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,000
And then put it in the particles of this cold virus

1127
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Micro force spreads out

1128
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
to infect more cells

1129
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
at this time

1130
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
if you have gram flu

1131
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
it can't put

1132
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
When the stripping acid is cut completely

1133
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
you can see

1134
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
you see a lot

1135
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
cold granules

1136
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
cold particles are

1137
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
caught in these cell membranes

1138
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
broken cell membrane

1139
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
you can see

1140
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
With the flu and without the flu

1141
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
this is no gram flu

1142
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
its difference

1143
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
they mean

1144
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
if you have the flu

1145
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
the gram flu you eat

1146
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
The spread rate of this cold

1147
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
will be halved

1148
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
or at least 40% off

1149
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
At this moment

1150
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
it goes infected

1151
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
capacity of other cells

1152
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
will be greatly reduced

1153
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
good

1154
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I will re-enter now

1155
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
another subject

1156
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
is nosocomial infection

1157
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,800
What about nosocomial infection? You see the hospital.

1158
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,800
The hospital is disinfected every day

1159
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:11,200
Then, what about the patients? Patients from all over the place went in again with bacteria.

1160
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,200
Disinfect again

1161
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:16,200
So the sick hospital is a nursery

1162
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:20,200
In a place where superbugs are grown

1163
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,700
What are superbugs?

1164
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:26,200
is that it is a multi-drug resistant

1165
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,500
multidrug resistant bacteria

1166
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:33,500
It's when your antibiotics are initially effective

1167
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,900
The more you use it, the less effective the more you use it

1168
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:39,500
So nosocomial infection is a very scary

1169
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,700
It's like talking about Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, Lilong infection bacteria

1170
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:47,300
Or S. pneumoniae, a bunch of bacteria.

1171
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,100
those

1172
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:53,700
Some bacteria are very poisonous and some bacteria are actually not very poisonous

1173
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,100
But what about older people?

1174
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,300
or people with chronic diseases like diabetes

1175
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,100
people with weak immunity

1176
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,600
Once he got to the hospital it was easy

1177
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,200
This is the high risk group

1178
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,800
These superbugs or multi-drug resistant bacteria

1179
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,600
it's easy to find him

1180
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,800
it will be like this

1181
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,000
to the hospital

1182
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,200
to the hospital

1183
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,000
The hospital is not a place of intersection

1184
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,200
don't go

1185
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,600
if you are not sick

1186
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,800
if you must go

1187
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,600
when you come out

1188
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,000
be sure to wash your hands

1189
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,600
Washing hands is one of the best defenses

1190
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,200
Or you wear a mask and wash your hands

1191
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,200
that's all the best

1192
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,400
nosocomial infection

1193
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,400
people have predictions

1194
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,400
like good

1195
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,900
this

1196
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,800
The economist two years ago said

1197
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,800
These multi-drug resistant things

1198
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,700
This creates a medical crisis for humanity

1199
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,400
use it as a cover

1200
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,400
He said

1201
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,600
this

1202
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,600
multidrug resistant bacteria

1203
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,400
you to the end

1204
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,400
No

1205
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,800
can't find

1206
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,000
can't find

1207
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,800
kill him

1208
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,640
He not only reports

1209
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:08,700
like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also reported

1210
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:11,780
For these multi-drug resistant

1211
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:12,800
he also has a report

1212
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:15,880
The weekly newsletter of the American Chemical Society

1213
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:20,220
He also reported this as a cover

1214
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,020
both years ago

1215
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,080
people are aware of the crisis

1216
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,040
if an elderly person goes to the hospital

1217
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,340
10

1218
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:35,880
What if you are

1219
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:37,940
Who are you

1220
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,260
The cancer patient is better or your other patients are better

1221
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:42,800
to the end

1222
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,880
In fact, many, probably more than half of the people

1223
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,660
all died of sepsis

1224
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,200
nosocomial infection

1225
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,040
septicemia

1226
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,060
What is septicemia

1227
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,140
Septicemia is when bacteria get into your blood

1228
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:57,900
in charge

1229
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,900
and make you inflamed blood

1230
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
blood inflammation

1231
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,140
Then what

1232
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:04,480
will be yours

1233
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,140
Because your immune system is weak, you will be infected

1234
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:08,400
blood to

1235
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,340
What about invading bacteria? Will it cause inflammation?

1236
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,060
to take charge so that in the end it is

1237
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,060
Light exhaustion, or something, just die

1238
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:21,820
This is a very serious medical issue

1239
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:24,800
What causes sepsis is

1240
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,300
There are some bacteria, some bacteria

1241
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,800
polysaccharide

1242
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,000
This is liver sepsis. In fact, it is also related to

1243
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,360
sugar related

1244
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:43,600
So how do we solve the problem of nosocomial infection?

1245
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,800
I think we can find new antibiotics

1246
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:50,080
Dean Weng recently had a paper

1247
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:53,320
well done if you are in

1248
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,940
The cover of our campus Zhongyuan Hospital

1249
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:56,940
he saw

1250
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,960
he develops new

1251
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,120
new antibiotics

1252
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,280
antibiotic

1253
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:05,880
you use

1254
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,280
He'll be resistant right away

1255
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,200
Therefore, many pharmaceutical companies are not willing to develop

1256
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,280
Because his cycle is too fast

1257
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,080
other profits

1258
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,960
development is difficult

1259
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:15,440
but

1260
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,120
Xu Jun is smarter than you

1261
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,720
Hsu Jun wants to be a few generations later

1262
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:25,560
He will be resistant to your antibiotics, and he will come out.

1263
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:27,920
another one?

1264
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,160
You need to bring your own preventive vaccines

1265
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,440
otherwise you will

1266
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:34,520
prevention

1267
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,560
I think

1268
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,840
Prevention of residual treatment

1269
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,520
So I am more inclined to make vaccines

1270
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,680
what is the vaccine for

1271
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,600
sugar required

1272
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,840
It's the superficial appearance

1273
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,600
polysaccharide

1274
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,840
used as an antigen

1275
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:50,960
make a vaccine

1276
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,080
you

1277
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:59,920
Glucose antibiotics are now on the market

1278
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,600
As for vaccines, the most famous one is that we don’t care about others.

1279
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,640
Let's take a look at the pneumococcal vaccine.

1280
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:11,400
Was Taipei City in October or December last year?

1281
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:17,240
That is, if you are 65 years old, you can get the pneumococcal vaccine, right?

1282
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:21,900
I used to be 75 years old, all of Taiwan

1283
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:25,400
like last year 2001

1284
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:30,400
this taipei city

1285
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,900
From October to December, as long as there are four people over 65 years old in Taipei

1286
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:40,600
You can subsidize a shot of 23 pneumococcal vaccines

1287
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:44,400
There are 23, there are 13, what is the difference?

1288
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,400
Right? Pneumonia streptoscopic

1289
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,600
I should go for a phone call, if I accidentally get hospitalized at my age

1290
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:55,800
If I get pneumonia streptoscopic

1291
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,800
Then maybe I'm miserable too

1292
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:06,000
What is it? It says 23 are Streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharide vaccines

1293
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Those 13 are Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines

1294
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:17,000
What is the full name Conjugated pneumococcal vaccine

1295
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:22,000
If I tell you like this, will you hear me?

1296
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
ok then let me explain why

1297
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
What is what is a polysaccharide vaccine

1298
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
What is a conjugate vaccine

1299
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I explain to you

1300
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,000
As I just said, bacteria have a layer of polysaccharides on their surface

1301
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
If we do our research

1302
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
This polysaccharide will be separated and purified

1303
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
superficial without damaging cells

1304
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
don't break the cells

1305
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
It is the polysaccharide on the surface that purifies it

1306
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
This is the polysaccharide on the surface I am now

1307
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,600
Okay, what about the 23rd one? The purified polysaccharides are just shot directly.

1308
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,600
hit you directly

1309
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:14,560
Of course they must have done some evaluation.

1310
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:18,400
Doing that will cause a funeral, it’s not as simple as what I said

1311
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,800
What are the 13 companies?

1312
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,960
13 is the one who wants the polysaccharide

1313
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,360
connect him to this carrier

1314
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,560
This carrier is protein

1315
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:33,160
attached to this carrier

1316
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,760
This polysaccharide should be connected to this sugar

1317
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:40,160
Anyway, this sugar is an antigen

1318
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:45,360
No matter if you use polysaccharide to make it or you connect it to a protein carrier to make it

1319
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,160
your major antigen

1320
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:53,160
These are the antigens that produce antibodies

1321
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:54,760
sugar

1322
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,160
You only need to connect to this protein

1323
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
They are called conjugate vaccines

1324
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
what's the difference between these two

1325
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
sorry it's complicated

1326
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
but i simplified it

1327
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
If you are a multiple

1328
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
when the vaccine

1329
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Dodo when the vaccine

1330
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
you may

1331
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
your efficiency is short

1332
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
The most important thing for us to vaccinate is to

1333
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
what do we want most

1334
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
have a memory

1335
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
have immune memory

1336
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
That is to say, I have been separated by two years

1337
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
three years later

1338
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
if the same

1339
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
antigen comes in

1340
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
will replace my immune memory

1341
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Because many of us are vaccinated

1342
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
not every few years

1343
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Same goes for the cold vaccine

1344
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
After you hit it, you have to last for a long time

1345
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Influenza vaccine every year

1346
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,400
If you are vaccinated with sugar

1347
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:07,000
If you take sugar vaccine

1348
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,340
your effect

1349
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,640
is relatively short

1350
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,480
because it has less immune memory

1351
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:16,140
Why compare memory without immunity? Because

1352
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,900
The antibodies it produces do not

1353
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:23,100
Let's say that the cells that produce antibodies are called B cells.

1354
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:27,660
Antibody-producing cells are not activated by T cells

1355
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,700
but if you

1356
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:30,940
yes

1357
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,140
is useful that

1358
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,640
combined vaccine words

1359
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,640
It has a longer memory

1360
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,100
the effect will be longer

1361
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:46,640
That's because, as long as you connect it to the egg white

1362
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,240
it will

1363
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:51,360
Destimulate T cells from V cells

1364
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:54,760
T cells come back to activate

1365
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,040
V cells give it memory

1366
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,600
I'm not an immunologist myself

1367
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,800
so i can't make this clear

1368
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,600
But it's the difference

1369
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,400
even

1370
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:14,000
If you directly use this polysaccharide

1371
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,800
Not good for children under two years old

1372
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:19,600
or older

1373
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,600
Sometimes the effect is not good

1374
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:25,000
So they have to work hard

1375
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,700
make it into a conjugate vaccine

1376
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,300
This is part of my research

1377
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,300
you can see

1378
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,600
look at this bacteria

1379
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,200
This is the bacteria on the cultivated rice

1380
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,600
One by one for many years

1381
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,400
why is it so sticky

1382
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,400
because of its shell

1383
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:51,100
The outer shell of this bacterium has a strong sugar

1384
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,400
very thick sugar

1385
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,600
what about this

1386
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,600
we're going to separate it

1387
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,000
then made

1388
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,600
make that antidote vaccine

1389
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,600
Why is the shell of the bacteria so thick with sugar?

1390
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,600
Once it enters our body

1391
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,100
it has that layer of protection

1392
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:13,100
It won't be swallowed by our immune cells

1393
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,100
And what about the layer of sugar?

1394
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,600
will poison us again

1395
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:22,100
Protecting it can poison us

1396
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:27,600
ok then i

1397
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,100
about the same time

1398
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,800
i speak faster now

1399
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,300
our healthy food

1400
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,800
The third and last part I will talk about healthy food

1401
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,700
Dragon Boat Festival is coming

1402
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:44,700
Everyone will eat zongzi

1403
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,800
but everyone knows

1404
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,200
Don't eat too much rice dumplings

1405
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,600
Because zongzi is difficult to digest

1406
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,500
Why Zongzi Are Difficult To Digest

1407
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,600
We have to look at its structure

1408
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,000
can you see

1409
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,700
if we are

1410
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,400
If glutinous rice is used, it will have a lot of nourishment

1411
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,300
It nourishes a lot, this is glutinous rice

1412
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,800
This place that is a little bit red is

1413
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,600
is the non-reducing end, that is, the enzyme

1414
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,400
Enzymes can decompose, enzymes can decompose

1415
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:20,000
So it has many places to decompose and can decompose at the same time

1416
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,600
But if you have less nourishment, probably you only have one or two

1417
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:29,700
So in general, it works very quickly at the beginning

1418
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:34,300
So glutinous rice is the first, it has a high glycemic index

1419
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:38,700
Because it works very quickly at the beginning, your glycemic index is very fast

1420
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:42,900
But, when its enzymes work until

1421
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:47,300
When reaching this branch point, close to this branch

1422
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:52,100
At the branch point, the enzyme will stop

1423
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:55,700
Because it can't work anymore, it needs to be replaced with another set

1424
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:58,400
Enzymes can continue to do

1425
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,400
At this moment

1426
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:06,000
it will, because you can't

1427
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
We humans can't absorb it

1428
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Therefore, it cannot be decomposed

1429
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It uses another enzyme to break down

1430
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
So digestion slows down

1431
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Slow down and you will bloat

1432
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Why does it swell?

1433
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Because Syria will use

1434
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Sometimes talk, because you can't digest

1435
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Digestion is fast at first, but when it arrives

1436
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Indigestion and indigestion later

1437
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
So this glutinous rice you have to see

1438
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
its branches, its branches

1439
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
The so-called look at this side, this side is all

1440
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Alpha one four connection

1441
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
The branch is to become alpha-16 to connect

1442
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
it has many branches

1443
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Many branches will decompose quickly

1444
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Decomposes slowly

1445
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Caused by high glycemic index

1446
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I'll let you back

1447
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Poor digestion

1448
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Because it is slow, so glutinous rice

1449
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,400
Its indigestibility depends on the structure of its starch

1450
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,900
it will be clear

1451
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:11,100
Some people have diarrhea after drinking milk

1452
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,960
What about milk diarrhea?

1453
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,420
Because it's in the milk

1454
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,440
Mostly lactose, this lactose is a disaccharide

1455
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:22,980
disaccharide

1456
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:27,560
We can't directly absorb and utilize this disaccharide

1457
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:30,040
This lactose is broken down into

1458
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:31,980
Galactose

1459
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,300
with this glucose

1460
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:37,340
have a valid number called lactose hydrolase

1461
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,620
You break it down into a galactose heel

1462
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:42,400
That glucose we can use the simple sugar we can use

1463
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:45,080
But unfortunately, some people

1464
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,440
no way

1465
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,060
or secreted this

1466
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:52,300
lactose hydrolase

1467
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:53,560
very few

1468
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:57,300
Or, there is no way to decompose it at this time

1469
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:00,220
What about the bacteria hiding inside?

1470
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
will come to use

1471
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:04,400
You don't need it, we often go there, there are bacteria in it

1472
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,600
just take advantage

1473
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,700
The result is often until the bacteria you have been using have been growing a lot

1474
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:11,600
Then you have diarrhea or gas or something.

1475
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:15,400
that's why you milk

1476
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,500
Drinking milk will stretch your stomach and make you gas

1477
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:22,100
In fact, it has something to do with sugar, your breakdown of sugar.

1478
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,900
It does matter, sometimes pigs do too.

1479
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,400
If a pig feeds him this

1480
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,500
this in beans

1481
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,500
its sugary

1482
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:32,800
material

1483
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,400
Pigs can't digest well

1484
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:38,200
What about the pigs, the bacteria in the sugar will grow

1485
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,000
will be like us

1486
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:45,800
And what about vitamin C, as we all know

1487
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,800
I eat one almost every day

1488
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:53,400
Then we can't synthesize it, we humans can't synthesize it

1489
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:56,000
Most animals can synthesize

1490
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:59,300
People I know with this Catholic agency

1491
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,300
Fighting again today

1492
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
These two are unable to synthesize vitamin C

1493
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Vitamin C in industry

1494
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
it comes directly from glucose

1495
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
in other plants or animals

1496
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:16,000
They can also be directly converted into vitamin C from glucose

1497
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Cut down on vitamin C

1498
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
your gold

1499
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Your gold strength must not be strong enough

1500
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
This is industrial glucose

1501
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Then after two steps it can

1502
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Vitamin C can be produced

1503
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Let's talk about sugar

1504
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
sugar substitute

1505
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
was discovered in England in 1976

1506
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
In the United States it was 1998

1507
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
approved

1508
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
that is, its useful life

1509
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
perhaps

1510
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
20 years

1511
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Sugar gold is in 18 years

1512
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
only century

1513
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:06,000
These discoveries of sugar substitutes were made by me by accident.

1514
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Then this sugar substitute is called Splendor

1515
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Splendor it's made from this sugar

1516
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:23,000
The part of the OH with a red dot is all replaced by this green

1517
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Its sweetness is about 600 times that of sugar

1518
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:35,000
So, but its advantage is that it is not metabolized in the digestive system

1519
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
can be almost eliminated from the body

1520
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:49,000
That is to say, if you don’t know if anyone can substitute sugar for this R48 sweetener

1521
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:55,000
R48 sweetness is calculated by two calculations

1522
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
R48 is sweet and this is sweeter than R48 because it is calculated

1523
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:07,000
If there are amino acids, one of the 20,000 people will have some problems with the metabolism of amino acids

1524
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
it produces disease

1525
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Then Aspartia is about 220 times the same as this set

1526
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Aspartia also has a bad place, that is

1527
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Once it's baked, it's about as sweet as

1528
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
If it's put in soda, it will also slowly descend

1529
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Because soda, if you add carbon dioxide to soda, there will be no carbonation

1530
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,000
What is the Ph value of carbonated soda?

1531
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
4, or lower, how much carbonic acid?

1532
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Anyway, it won't be neutral, it should be acidic

1533
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
At this time, it is possible for Aspartia to

1534
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Aspartame may lose its sweetness slowly

1535
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
but this thing it won't

1536
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Its trade name is Sprander

1537
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,600
that real name is

1538
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,100
Sucrose

1539
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,000
Frankly, I ate this

1540
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,100
because it's cheap a kilo

1541
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,500
Seven or eight thousand Taiwan dollars, made in Canada

1542
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:17,300
then you can too

1543
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:20,020
where am i here

1544
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:21,700
Where

1545
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:24,500
foreign

1546
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,820
I'm abroad this

1547
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:29,300
Summerway saw that they added this

1548
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:30,700
Summerway

1549
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,200
add this

1550
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,400
That

1551
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,000
good i think

1552
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,200
Everyone should be familiar with bird's nest

1553
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,700
Because we Orientals, especially Chinese

1554
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:44,200
think bird's nest is a

1555
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:48,200
It's a good nourishment, isn't it?

1556
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,600
Bird's nest is actually good or bad

1557
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:54,100
Decide on two Decide whether it's good or bad There are two

1558
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,200
One is protein and the other is sugar

1559
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,200
Bird's nest is believed to contain

1560
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:00,600
sugar

1561
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
High amount of dehydrating acid

1562
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
His good or bad dehydrating acid if the content is high

1563
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
they think it's good

1564
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
I'm sorry because I don't know

1565
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
what if i ate it

1566
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Does it have nutritional or health benefits?

1567
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I do not know about this

1568
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I'm going to ask that nutritionist

1569
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
okay i say good things

1570
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
That leaf environmentalist is here to scold me

1571
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I'm sorry because I really don't know

1572
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Is it good or bad to eat bird's nest?

1573
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Then bring it down

1574
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
This is my real experiment

1575
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I did the last two years

1576
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
That is to say, everyone will say

1577
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
edible mushroom polysaccharide

1578
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I really polysaccharides in my experiment

1579
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
It's mushrooms

1580
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
two kinds of mushrooms

1581
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
One is dirty beef juice

1582
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
one is black fungus

1583
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
he really

1584
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
we confirm

1585
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
He can really enhance people's immunity

1586
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,500
It activates giant cells

1587
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,100
These giant cells are our immune cells

1588
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:09,900
It can increase the bactericidal phagocytosis of giant cells

1589
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:13,500
can also increase the strength of a person who inhales endotoxins

1590
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:17,100
If we say that when we get infected in the hospital

1591
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:20,600
If we usually eat more of these mushrooms

1592
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:27,000
It is possible to suffer from the septicemia just now

1593
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
It will be lessened, maybe

1594
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:34,500
this of course it is we are

1595
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
The polysaccharide structure of this beef dirty juice

1596
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
analyze it and see how it looks

1597
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,700
This part of the reaction is doing Yilan University

1598
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,000
Professor Hua helped us do it

1599
01:21:51,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Well, some people also say that this is the starting value of chitin

1600
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,200
These are polysaccharides

1601
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,600
Then sometimes this can be used in agriculture

1602
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,800
Can enhance plant health or

1603
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,100
Resistance

1604
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:11,300
Some people also say that you eat alphanuclides

1605
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:14,000
Can lose weight and lower cholesterol

1606
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,100
because

1607
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:18,100
There are some alphanuclides it is put this

1608
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,000
by

1609
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,700
to suck

1610
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,500
After this cut it off

1611
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:23,400
it is belt

1612
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,200
It is also positively charged

1613
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,300
can put some

1614
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,800
What about charged fatty acids?

1615
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:30,900
take it

1616
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,600
Adsorb and then

1617
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,500
take it out of the body

1618
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,000
Some people say it can lose weight

1619
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,900
I don't know

1620
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,600
But there are many healthy foods

1621
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,900
squeeze nails

1622
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,300
Squeeze the nail is the top

1623
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:44,500
Then a nuclide

1624
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,100
just leave it at this

1625
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:47,200
this

1626
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,300
this removes it

1627
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,400
just let it electrify

1628
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,200
What about this one? I encourage you a little.

1629
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,500
this is the same

1630
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:57,300
This micro-encouragement is the same

1631
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:59,200
Grape Chang'an

1632
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
It is mainly a cartilage mechanism

1633
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
like our joints

1634
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Osteoarthritis as we age

1635
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Osteoarthritis is primarily

1636
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Why do our joints have cartilage?

1637
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
because it is mainly cartilage-forming

1638
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Cartilage absorbs a lot of water

1639
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
increase the awareness of this joint

1640
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
So Glucose

1641
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:32,000
It can provide you with this recognition

1642
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Can also do this hyaluronic acid is also a glucose

1643
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
It can also be a type of hyaluronic acid

1644
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
like hyaluronic acid

1645
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
it's more useful

1646
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Whether it is cosmetic moisturizing

1647
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,000
The current ones can be mass-produced with follow-up

1648
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
what was the earliest

1649
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Take it out from the organ, the attacking organ

1650
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
What is the use of

1651
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:04,900
If you go to some places like Hong Kong, there is Saima

1652
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:06,400
Saima's horse

1653
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,000
it joint this this

1654
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,900
Saima joints are treated with cloth uric acid

1655
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:15,400
I don't know if the real Saima is playing in the early days or not

1656
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,900
I used to watch when I was a kid and I couldn't understand

1657
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:20,700
But that's all he uses

1658
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,700
Well, I think this molecule has a lot of cousins.

1659
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:29,400
In fact, it's related to both cancer and the immune system.

1660
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:30,500
In fact

1661
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,500
In front of Vice President Liu, I'm playing tricks

1662
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,800
In fact, er, Vice President Liu is also an expert of Tangzi.

1663
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,000
Especially in this galactose

1664
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,100
Galactose

1665
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,600
Galactose Lingjisu 3

1666
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,400
It's our Vice President Liu

1667
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:51,000
found

1668
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,400
Is it related to cancer?

1669
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,900
If you are on this side

1670
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:58,000
of course to ask

1671
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Vice President Liu, I, I, really

1672
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
So when I talk about this, I probably want to say something

1673
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,000
But at the end I want to introduce Tangzi Science Education Foundation to you

1674
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Minister Liu just said that the police mourned the professor and his wife

1675
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
to Taiwan in 1996

1676
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Because at that time the University of Tokyo was a national university in Japan

1677
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
It is about 60 years old and must retire

1678
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
So he in 1994

1679
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Why does he have so much affection for Taiwan?

1680
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
because he is born

1681
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
he was born in taiwan

1682
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Then he didn't return to Japan until he was 11 or 12 years old

1683
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
1934

1684
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
So he returned to Japan in 1945 or 1946

1685
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,000
So he is willing to come to Taiwan

1686
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
And in Taiwan

1687
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
and his wife's salary are all built

1688
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Establish the Tangzi Foundation

1689
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:58,000
At that time, of course, Dean Li was established in 2002

1690
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Dean Li also went to raise funds

1691
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
There are several like Uniform Yimei

1692
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,000
and gold car

1693
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
And Yong Fengyu's family

1694
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Under the call of Dean Li

1695
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Also set up a foundation

1696
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
But in 2003

1697
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Former Dean Weng returned to Taiwan

1698
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Foundation Center

1699
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
His power is much greater than the foundation

1700
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Over the past 10 years, our foundation

1701
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
didn't play very well

1702
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Because Dean Weng has taken the lead in

1703
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
make a lot of pushes in this direction

1704
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
In the future, I hope that everyone

1705
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Learn about our foundation

1706
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
In fact our slogan is

1707
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Kangzhi Technology Anti-disease and anti-aging

1708
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
This is our logo

1709
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
ok thank you all

1710
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Thanks

1711
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,400
Well, thanks to Dr. Wu Zhixiong for being very informative

1712
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,400
and a very careful speech

1713
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:12,200
So now open up some of that questioning

1714
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,400
I also encourage you to ask

1715
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,600
So if we ask

1716
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,400
would give a very nice one

1717
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,800
Is it a cup type cup electricity?

1718
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:23,400
ok over here

1719
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,200
Why is the non-reducing side crowded out of here

1720
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:35,600
can say it again

1721
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:40,600
This is a basic structure of Tang Zi

1722
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,900
he must

1723
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:46,600
almost always use one to pick up

1724
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,800
he can pick up at six

1725
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:48,700
can be picked up in four

1726
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:49,600
can be connected in three

1727
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:50,600
can be connected in two

1728
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:54,200
As long as there is OH, he can pick it up

1729
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:55,500
Tropical acid exception

1730
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:56,900
Tropical acid is connected with two

1731
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:58,300
But his structure is

1732
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:59,300
just the same

1733
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:00,000
that is

1734
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,760
Take it like this, after you take it

1735
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,440
The non-reducing end must be the outermost

1736
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:07,580
because he was connected

1737
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,740
He combines with fat or with

1738
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:13,300
protein binding is to use his

1739
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:14,800
restore terminal

1740
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:20,360
That one, didn’t you mention H and N just now?

1741
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,640
Isn't that N used to cut that H?

1742
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:27,220
N is cutting acid

1743
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:28,980
cut acid

1744
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:32,260
Because it is deacidified, hydrolyzed

1745
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:33,260
N

1746
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:36,000
So if you see H1N1

1747
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,540
this is him

1748
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:40,740
He has many categories, like H generally has 16 categories

1749
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:42,060
N has 9 categories

1750
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:43,620
this is normal

1751
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:45,360
Then how to divide it, yes

1752
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,740
it's this virus that got to us

1753
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:50,400
Antibodies produced by the body

1754
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:53,100
Sometimes these antibodies are used to classify

1755
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:57,140
The N will only work after he has to leave

1756
01:28:57,140 --> 01:28:59,460
or before infection he will

1757
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,640
this is a good question

1758
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:06,140
Its virus is a very good distribution of H and N

1759
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:11,320
H is about 3 to 4 times N

1760
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:14,320
About 3 to 4 times outside

1761
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,600
If I hadn't been very careful just now

1762
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:20,240
I said its amount is the amount on the surface of the virus

1763
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,860
H will be more than N

1764
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:24,240
about 3 to 4 times more

1765
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:28,460
So when it is picked up, N must play first

1766
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:31,020
I said N it's going to find dehydrating acid

1767
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:34,600
The dehydrating acid must be found at the outermost end

1768
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:35,760
then this is the first step

1769
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,100
It is the first step to enter the cell

1770
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:42,860
I think I still want to ask about vaccines.

1771
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:48,300
What does 13 plus 23 plus mean?

1772
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:54,060
That is to say, if you go to see dried mushrooms in Tai Tam

1773
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:57,460
I use Tai Tam dried fungus and everyone will know better

1774
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:59,160
a bacteria

1775
01:29:59,160 --> 01:29:59,960
its

1776
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,560
Sugar out there is ever-changing

1777
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:04,100
ever-changing

1778
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:06,400
If you say big sugar dry

1779
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,420
How many kinds does it have

1780
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:10,240
Types of sugar outside

1781
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:11,780
Hundreds of

1782
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:13,820
Hundreds of each

1783
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:15,620
we just look at

1784
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,160
What kind of

1785
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,940
That is to say, initially there were 7

1786
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,220
these 7

1787
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:21,500
These 7 kinds

1788
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:26,620
Streptococcus pneumoniae

1789
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:28,920
nosocomial infection

1790
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:29,940
Play these 7 kinds first

1791
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,980
In the future you will put these 7 kinds

1792
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:33,020
After crushing it?

1793
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:33,780
anything else

1794
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,880
other species will

1795
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:39,160
in charge

1796
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:41,460
So add 13 more

1797
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,260
plus 23 kinds

1798
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:44,540
so

1799
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:47,100
These vaccines are not absolute, you still follow

1800
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,640
False progress is racing

1801
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:52,220
It's a good thing the research is endless, or I'd be out of a job.

1802
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,760
right

1803
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:57,080
What this research can't do is to fight like this

1804
01:30:58,920 --> 01:30:59,900
by bwd6

1805
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
good

1806
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Teacher Wu has two questions about Niu Zhang Chi

1807
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,000
The first question is that the octopus fungus grows on ordinary wood

1808
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,000
What's the difference between growing on the ox octopus

1809
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
The second problem is its toxicity to Niu Zhang Chi

1810
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Is it to the extent that it will hurt people?

1811
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Because I'm not a fanatic

1812
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
so sorry it's hard for me to answer your question

1813
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,000
When I have retired colleagues who do just that

1814
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
he knows better than me

1815
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I may answer wrong here

1816
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
because i don't know much

1817
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I'm crazy about being a cow

1818
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
People have done a lot

1819
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I just came in to do it

1820
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
But what I do is limit in Duotang

1821
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
There are many others like tri-iron

1822
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:09,000
A bunch of them, what are you doing?

1823
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Well, to be honest, I don't understand enough.

1824
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Sorry I can't answer your question

1825
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
ok ask again

1826
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:26,000
thanks ok i have a question is it ok to have a punch

1827
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
One question is about experts H1N1

1828
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
So do these numbers have any special significance?

1829
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
What is the N level? Does the N level have any special meaning?

1830
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Thanks

1831
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
is there any special meaning

1832
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
what does that mean

1833
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I don't know about N1 and N2

1834
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:49,000
because that is in fact

1835
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
The difference in the sequence of amino acid caused his this

1836
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Antibodies produced by blood type will be different

1837
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
sorry i don't know

1838
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Now that means in 1918 it was N1 H1

1839
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:10,000
There was also a pandemic in 1957

1840
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
it is N2 H2

1841
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,000
There was also a pandemic in 1968

1842
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:20,000
That one I remember is H2 H3 N2

1843
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
then what

1844
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Then in the end it is 1 2 3 in the end

1845
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I think it's a category

1846
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
it's not different

1847
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Its Ankywan sequence is not the same cause

1848
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
because it's protein

1849
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
So it is possible that H1 N1 will come back

1850
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
possible

1851
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
still never come back

1852
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Probably will come back

1853
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I can not do it

1854
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
will look back

1855
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
That is H1 N1 is just in H1 N1

1856
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
likely to reappear

1857
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
show up again

1858
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
another comment

1859
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
About Lushan

1860
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I'm sorry, I'm Lu Shan

1861
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
yes

1862
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
perch acid

1863
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Exercising only when you are tired

1864
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Perch acid can only be produced under anaerobic metabolism

1865
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
the research we did

1866
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
we use

1867
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
We do sports nutrition research

1868
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Then we do exhaustion exercise

1869
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Wale Train athletes

1870
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
It's the mountain iron player

1871
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
his fatigue

1872
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
to perch acid to achieve a bath of high quality

1873
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
it's dying

1874
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Its very high concentration of perch acid

1875
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,000
It clears up in about 15 to 20 minutes

1876
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
stop and clear

1877
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
won't wait until the next day

1878
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
So fast

1879
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
so it this

1880
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
its perch

1881
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
so tired the next day

1882
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
It's not because of perch

1883
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
It's because of the action of delayed onset muscle acid

1884
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
delayed muscle soreness

1885
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
because of a muscle injury

1886
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
So it has nothing to do with perch

1887
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
so no reference

1888
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Thanks

1889
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
here

1890
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Hello Professor Wu

1891
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
My problem is just that

1892
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
The controgated vaccine of Numococcus

1893
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
he

1894
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I'm curious about his carrier

1895
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
what will it be

1896
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
and hit us inside

1897
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
because we also develop some antibodies to it

1898
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
what kind of thing is it

1899
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,000
We feel it's a safe way to use this

1900
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
This is because of the carrier protein

1901
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
fixed

1902
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
like rhinotoxin

1903
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,000
after it detoxifies

1904
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
many people are using

1905
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
becomes a carrier protein

1906
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
even you can buy

1907
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
then why use this

1908
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
This detoxified white monkey is toxic

1909
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I'm thinking that someone missed the research

1910
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Well, I don't have a big problem with this aspect.

1911
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Research

1912
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
So it is the detoxification of the white monkey

1913
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
That

1914
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
One of these is a white monkey

1915
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Then the carrier vaccine we used

1916
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
will it be

1917
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Although the white monkey is almost out of muscle

1918
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
But do we also develop antibodies against it?

1919
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
a bit curious

1920
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
of course

1921
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,700
Because it's still a foreign antigen?

1922
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:08,800
I'm addressing the question asked by the lady just in front of me

1923
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,540
I remember that H

1924
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:13,200
It is Hema Glutinin

1925
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:16,840
Is it related to Host specificity?

1926
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:21,000
H123 seems to be the key to open the Human Flu

1927
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,440
And that H57 is the key to Avian Flu

1928
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:26,400
We'll simply say

1929
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:28,140
Yes, but many people at the scene should know

1930
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:29,800
So I play big swords in front of sightseeing

1931
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,800
ok thank you sir

1932
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,800
yes

1933
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:41,800
The one I want to ask is just about Cerule protein

1934
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:45,800
The teacher said that Cerule protein can last longer

1935
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:49,800
Because it can start the memory of the Tc package

1936
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,800
Then everyone will explain in detail

1937
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,800
Because I don't know much about the intermediate process

1938
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:59,800
I don't think I'm an immunologist

1939
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
to help you explain this

1940
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
I'm afraid I can't explain it clearly.

1941
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
but this is

1942
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,000
If we put it into this

1943
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
at this place

1944
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
If it is a multiple hall

1945
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
It can't be B

1946
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
It has no way to Present is

1947
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
MHC2 here

1948
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,000
It has no way to generate this to follow B

1949
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Come talk to T

1950
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
If you only have multiple halls

1951
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
If you are Duotang

1952
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
If you are a carbohydrate antigen

1953
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
attached to protein

1954
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Connected to this Protonite

1955
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
it can

1956
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,000
After B can talk to T

1957
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
T cells in

1958
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
secrete some

1959
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:06,000
in the looking what is this Chinese

1960
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Boundary number

1961
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:12,000
and then stimulate this

1962
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
So the main difference is whether he can perform

1963
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
It is the expression of this antigen that causes him to be

1964
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
difference in the effect of memory

1965
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,000
i know now

1966
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,000
But I just said I'm not an immunologist

1967
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Maybe there are immunologists here

1968
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
can help me answer

1969
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Then I'll go find it myself

1970
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Thank you, teacher

1971
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
High school textbooks say that the B cell

1972
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
If it is a polysaccharide antigen

1973
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
B cell is to do the receptor mediated endocytosis

1974
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Then activate to become that plasma cell

1975
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
But then it can't use that mc

1976
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
to present antigen

1977
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,000
去activate specific dehelper

1978
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
so it doesn't have that

1979
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
it still produces specific antibodies

1980
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
there is no merry

1981
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,760
But the main thing is to understand why

1982
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:05,760
If you add QQ protein to QQ protein

1983
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,960
It can be started but if it is not added

1984
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:10,600
It is more difficult to express

1985
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:15,160
thank you thank you teacher

1986
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,000
here for sir

1987
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,500
Mr. Wu would like to ask you for advice

1988
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,100
Just now you talked about that EPO

1989
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,200
Can we talk a little more about the kidneys?

1990
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:30,960
For example, the one

1991
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,960
Kidney dialysis patients will have flat blood

1992
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:35,660
About the relationship between EPO and the kidney

1993
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:37,360
Teacher, can you talk a little more?

1994
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:39,200
like erythrocyte renin

1995
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,200
because

1996
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,300
Kidney dialysis man

1997
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,800
This one from EPO

1998
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,200
Erythrocyte renin will be less

1999
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,500
because he is the most important

2000
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,960
Epo is secreted from our kidney cells

2001
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:56,360
Then the kidney cells of your kidney dialysis person will be

2002
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:58,120
will be weaker

2003
01:39:58,120 --> 01:39:59,920
he can't have

2004
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,600
Appropriate amount out

2005
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:03,800
then if you have

2006
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,800
If the doctor gives you an injection

2007
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:09,400
Your red blood cell count will increase

2008
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:12,200
Then your normal blood will be relieved

2009
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:15,200
you will be more energetic

2010
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,720
Because after all, red blood cells are

2011
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,000
Oxygen?

2012
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,600
We know oxygen consumption

2013
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:23,600
It has a lot to do with our energy

2014
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:28,600
ask a question

2015
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:31,600
That is to say, it is mentioned that it is cow's dirty juice

2016
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:33,600
And that black fungus

2017
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,600
Its polysaccharides are activated

2018
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,600
The function of that megalithic cell

2019
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,600
then i want to ask

2020
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,600
I don't know if it has been compared

2021
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,600
The two sources of polysaccharides

2022
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:46,600
Does it work differently

2023
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:47,600
and because we know

2024
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:48,600
Does beef offal seem expensive?

2025
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:51,600
Then I asked if I should actually eat more black fungus

2026
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:52,600
it's ok

2027
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:53,600
Thanks

2028
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
can you help me answer this question

2029
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,000
In fact, other effective

2030
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,000
People have always believed that the effective ingredients are not only multitasking

2031
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:24,000
But because I want to be different from other people who study

2032
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Because people are making too many other active ingredients

2033
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
The person who studied Niu Zhangzhi has been in Taiwan for a long time

2034
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:38,000
But I haven't seen anyone who does multiple halls come out.

2035
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:45,000
The reason is that it is definitely not that simple for you to understand the structure of Duotang

2036
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:50,000
That's why we thought we'd try and see what we put in to do this

2037
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I want to differentiate myself from other researchers

2038
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:01,000
If you separate, you are more effective

2039
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,280
Opportunity to receive research funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology

2040
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:07,280
different from everyone

2041
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:13,280
I use this idea to do this research

2042
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:18,780
In fact, the research time is quite long.

2043
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:22,280
It will probably take three or four years

2044
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:24,280
A doctoral student wants to

2045
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:28,780
Those two things take four years in a doctoral program

2046
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:31,220
to finish it

2047
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:34,720
there is a gentleman behind

2048
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:38,720
sorry, i want to ask

2049
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:40,720
can explain a little bit

2050
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:42,720
When we study sugar

2051
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,720
The process of storage and separation

2052
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:48,220
Because sugars are not like amino acids in proteins

2053
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:50,220
there is only one solution

2054
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:52,220
it can have many solutions

2055
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:54,220
And there are not only twenty types of sugar

2056
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:56,220
So you can ask me a little bit

2057
01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:58,220
how to actually do

2058
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:00,260
How to do

2059
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,700
It is the method of storing and identifying

2060
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:06,500
is to recognize the difference

2061
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:09,500
generally like sugar

2062
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:12,500
Sugar research is slow to find

2063
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:14,000
but progress is slow

2064
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
But recently progress is faster

2065
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Progress is slow for two reasons

2066
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,500
Because your chemistry didn't keep up

2067
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:25,500
like this

2068
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:28,000
For protein

2069
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Its synthesis can be automated

2070
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
After the 80s

2071
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
genetic function

2072
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,500
to produce the protein of our medicine

2073
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:40,000
that for this DNA

2074
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,500
or RNA speaking

2075
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:44,000
Also because of the synthetic technique

2076
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
and we say

2077
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
How do you say PCR is a table in Chinese?

2078
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
right

2079
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
ex girl

2080
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
After these developments

2081
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
So DNA

2082
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,000
The research on this nucleic acid should be done as much as possible

2083
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,000
So sugar is the first one you can detect, you can’t detect it

2084
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,000
because we're detecting proteins and nucleic acids

2085
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,000
We can use ultraviolet light

2086
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:18,000
But with sugar you can't detect it in ultraviolet light

2087
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Therefore, it is an obstacle to both analysis and synthesis.

2088
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
That is the way you said just now.

2089
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,000
You probably only have at most two ways of connecting two amino acids.

2090
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,000
One N segment and one C segment at most two

2091
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Go see if one amino acid becomes two amino acids

2092
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
In terms of diamine, it is a kind of

2093
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:44,000
But sugar, a monosaccharide linked to a disaccharide

2094
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:49,000
it has eleven types so its complexity is high

2095
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:54,000
And it's a lot more indirect like Avaboda Iii Izo

2096
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:59,000
It's complicated, but it's really inside a living organism

2097
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
not that complicated

2098
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
why

2099
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Because he wants to pick up a Tang sword

2100
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
He's wasting a gene

2101
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
pick him up to make one

2102
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
synthesized like you

2103
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
At once

2104
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Alpha medical affairs

2105
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
or Beta Medicine

2106
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
is to consume a gene

2107
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
is a valid number

2108
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
to lead this

2109
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
people

2110
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Genes are coded

2111
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
people

2112
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
forming Tang sword

2113
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
about 200

2114
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
various efficacies

2115
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
we call this

2116
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Glycoxial Transverse

2117
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
how to translate

2118
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
That's about 200 or so

2119
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
so

2120
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
you can watch

2121
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
his true presence

2122
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
The structure is not so complicated

2123
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I think

2124
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
The hard part is

2125
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Modifications on the Tang Sword

2126
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
this is difficult

2127
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
A single hyaluronic acid

2128
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
he was groomed probably

2129
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
there is

2130
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Forty or fifty ways of repairing

2131
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,500
this is hard

2132
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:06,500
If you just modify it

2133
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:11,000
Its combination with the number of coagulation poles changes the

2134
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,500
any modification

2135
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:16,000
So the difficulty is here

2136
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,000
I think it's very difficult because

2137
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:25,000
As for the real Tang Jian?

2138
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,500
sometimes if you have

2139
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,500
You can also send it to help others.

2140
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:32,000
1,500 yuan broke two days without gold

2141
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
They did it for you

2142
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,000
Do you have any other questions

2143
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Just now it seems that there is someone thinking about Fangwen in the back

2144
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Wait a moment

2145
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I just talked about the Dotang vaccine

2146
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,500
For the elderly and children under the age of two

2147
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:00,000
Effect

2148
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Why is his effect on these two ethnic groups less effective?

2149
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Then there is his so-called short effect

2150
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
If the effect is short, how short is it?

2151
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Then for such an application on the pre-hospital study

2152
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,000
What kind of applicable timing?

2153
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
that is

2154
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
this is really sorry

2155
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
because I

2156
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
first i am not a doctor

2157
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
The dean of liufu is actually a doctor

2158
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:29,000
It seems to say that only polysaccharides are used instead of that

2159
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
You can do it without Count

2160
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
no carrier

2161
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,000
is it not good

2162
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
still the same as before

2163
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,000
The carrier is to increase his immunity

2164
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Will cause T-cell Response

2165
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Then T-cell is T helper

2166
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
It is Hel B-cell

2167
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
This kind of concept about this kind

2168
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Simply put it like this

2169
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Then at this stage

2170
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Because just now we talked about 23 and 13

2171
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Since these two are polysaccharide vaccines and conjugate vaccines, there is a difference

2172
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Then there are products on his food now?

2173
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
for is

2174
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,400
Is it really a polysaccharide vaccine?

2175
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:03,900
is there such a

2176
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:05,500
you say

2177
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,000
It should be NUEMO COCKER

2178
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:09,800
Vaccine is polysaccharide

2179
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:10,500
13

2180
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:11,000
13

2181
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,300
13 is

2182
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:13,500
come to get a vaccine

2183
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:14,300
is a conjugate vaccine

2184
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:16,400
Yeah, he just talked about a 23 frame being polysaccharide

2185
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:16,800
right

2186
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:18,900
23 is the same

2187
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:19,900
is also a carrier

2188
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:21,500
Is it also a carrier?

2189
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:22,400
yes yes no

2190
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,100
No information I see is

2191
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,300
yes he is more than one

2192
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:27,500
a polisacra

2193
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:29,100
what's his name

2194
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:30,200
You have a vaccine Samyam

2195
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:30,800
Yeah

2196
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:32,700
I

2197
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:38,200
no no no this

2198
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:43,060
he is this

2199
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:44,100
PPV?

2200
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,700
He's PPV so a polisacra vaccine

2201
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:51,900
Is this information wrong? I don't know

2202
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
The mayor mayor can already have 23

2203
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,000
There are 23

2204
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,000
The range of protection is about 80%

2205
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,000
8 Narita

2206
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Because it's short-acting but I don't know how short-acting it is

2207
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
this may be

2208
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Short-acting sometimes varies from person to person

2209
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,000
I don't know, I really don't know

2210
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
good committee

2211
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
our last question

2212
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,000
I remember we commemorate the pneumonia vaccine

2213
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,000
It means that you only need to play once in a lifetime, it seems

2214
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Then if it was these 23 fights, it was short-term

2215
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Why only fight once in a lifetime

2216
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
that's a really good question

2217
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Pneumonia doesn't seem to be just one shot all the time

2218
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Because I played it myself, I still need boost

2219
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Another problem is that hospital infection

2220
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Because when my father was 89 years old

2221
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,000
never get sick just because it is

2222
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Constipation entered the hospital for seven days and left

2223
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,000
The final result is nosocomial infection

2224
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Then we ask that your ward be cleaned again for me.

2225
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
or what can we do

2226
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:15,000
It was our doctor who brought the bacteria

2227
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:19,000
No, I think the bacteria was already in the hospital.

2228
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Because of that bacteria, look, you're in the hospital

2229
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:26,000
You sterilize, and then everyone brings the bacteria in

2230
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,000
And then the bacterium is its genetic material that gets passed around

2231
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Then you and your disinfection is to make it have the power of evolution

2232
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Right, so it evolves more and more powerful

2233
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:45,000
It if you kill 99% of the bacteria

2234
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:52,000
You still survive in large numbers, it's even stronger

2235
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
I don't know if the health insurance has statistics

2236
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:58,000
How many elderly people died of hospital infection

2237
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
We would also like to have such public information to allow

2238
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,500
We patients know that I am old

2239
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:03,840
Should I go to the hospital or not?

2240
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:04,500
or how

2241
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:06,000
What's the reason to go to the hospital

2242
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:09,700
Can you make your delivery a little longer?

2243
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:11,900
this is one

2244
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,100
you're sick of course you want to go to the hospital

2245
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:19,100
What about going to the hospital?

2246
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:21,100
Afraid of nosocomial infection

2247
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:23,000
what do you do

2248
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:26,800
this is a good question

2249
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:29,100
I don't know what the doctor will decide

2250
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:33,000
Or to become a style news

2251
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:38,500
I sometimes think so

2252
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:41,500
i've been thinking about this

2253
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:44,600
because sometimes you have to decide

2254
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:45,900
what medicine do you take

2255
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:48,900
Because you want to see what bacteria

2256
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:49,900
what medicine

2257
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:50,900
doctor he has

2258
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:53,200
so i always feel like saying

2259
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,000
in this hospital

2260
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:57,300
nosocomial infection bacteria

2261
01:51:57,300 --> 01:51:58,800
should be announced

2262
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,600
Then sometimes if you have to decide what bacteria

2263
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:06,400
it may be days before you find out

2264
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:10,600
This patient may have left

2265
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:16,000
So I've always wondered if there's a way to do a quick quick screening

2266
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
can determine what bacteria it is

2267
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,200
Then we quickly dose

2268
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:23,200
it's possible to bring it back

2269
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:28,000
this is what i don't know

2270
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I have been wondering if there is a better way

2271
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:38,000
I would like to add a little bit to the issue of nosocomial infection

2272
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Nosocomial infection actually involves two parts

2273
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
One is the use of antibiotics

2274
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
the resistance it produces

2275
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
The other one, of course, is the patient's resistance

2276
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
So the question asked by this partner just now

2277
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
If you want to announce this part

2278
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,000
It is actually on the one hand

2279
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
In fact, there is not that high evidence that

2280
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Which bacteria is actually causing

2281
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Because of the drug that caused the infection and even caused death

2282
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,000
reason because if he really would cause death

2283
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
He may be the so-called cluster infection

2284
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,000
instead of just one or two patients dying from this bacterium

2285
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
So it involves his personal immunity

2286
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,000
So this is what he wants to pursue

2287
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Going back to medical reasons, he may have many layers

2288
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Reducing nosocomial infections is like what the teacher, Mr. Wu, just said

2289
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
In fact, hand washing is a very important key step

2290
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
How to cut off or wear a mask in the hospital

2291
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Avoid direct infections on the nose and mouth

2292
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,000
These are the basics, that is to say, you can do it yourself in the hospital.

2293
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Then we patients have to protect ourselves when we go in.

2294
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Probably such a situation

2295
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Thanks

2296
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Today is live

2297
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:45,000
So there are already viewers asking questions

2298
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
ask questions to everyone

2299
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
you see a lot of fans

2300
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:53,000
One question is how the longan is added to the protein

2301
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
is your profession

2302
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
How to add sugar to protein

2303
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,000
very simple

2304
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:06,000
he added to the protein

2305
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
He has specific mainly two places

2306
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Two kinds of security

2307
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:14,000
how to add sugar how to add

2308
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
that candy

2309
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
don't recognize you help me answer

2310
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
no no no no added to protein what is

2311
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
I didn't know this guy is sometimes your specialty

2312
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,000
This is added in this Guoju Paris

2313
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
this his problem is

2314
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Yes, I don’t know how it is added in the cells

2315
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
how to add in the cell

2316
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
I don't know what the problem is

2317
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
What is added in the high-vision body

2318
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
yes the question is

2319
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
How to add it in the cell

2320
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
That's what you just mentioned

2321
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Hook and squeeze

2322
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Guo Ju Paris

2323
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
pick up

2324
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
on the ER

2325
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,000
What about answering?

2326
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
rely on eyebrows

2327
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
by eyebrow

2328
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Yep

2329
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,000
By eyebrow

2330
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
if it's chemistry

2331
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
chemical words

2332
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
chemical basis

2333
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
yes yes go to the basics

2334
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
right

2335
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Yeah

2336
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,000
yes but

2337
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,000
It's not that simple if you're using chemistry

2338
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:06,640
like we just said

2339
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:09,320
If you want to fight, give it

2340
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:11,320
It's the conjugate vaccine

2341
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:12,440
just add

2342
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:14,280
just to

2343
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:16,000
we are added

2344
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:17,920
the one above lysine

2345
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:19,400
Like you said

2346
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,400
Lighting above

2347
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:22,440
Eminogur

2348
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:25,760
Of course there must be something to activate it

2349
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:29,600
right

2350
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,200
Or you can be a Linker

2351
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:33,280
then the sugar is

2352
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:35,200
Generally speaking, we need Linker

2353
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:36,800
This Linker chooses

2354
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:38,200
Very Picky

2355
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:40,800
This Linker option cannot

2356
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:42,840
Linker it

2357
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:46,280
Antigenetic too high

2358
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:47,200
also not

2359
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:49,440
That is to say, it is easy to produce Antibodyzo

2360
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,680
many such options

2361
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:53,600
a lot to think about

2362
01:55:57,200 --> 01:55:58,600
well, we're running out of time

2363
01:55:58,600 --> 01:55:59,320
thank you

2364
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Then we once again thank Wu Zhixiong for his very mentality speech

2365
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Thanks

2366
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:10,000
The preview I need to make is knowledge miss in June

2367
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:14,000
The topic of the talk is Hu Shi and Li Ao

2368
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Interactions Between Two Generations of Liberals in Taiwan

2369
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Is the keynote speaker of the Huang Kewu Special Research Fellow at the Institute of Modern History

2370
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Please sign up to attend this speech

2371
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Okay, thank you

2372
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Thanks
