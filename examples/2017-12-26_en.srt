Today's meeting was supposed to be hosted by the vice president of our Humanities Society

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But it just so happens that he is not here today because of a pharmacist, and even the vice presidents are very busy, so there is no way

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So I had to be represented by Quan Cong, and I would like to say sorry to the host

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Today's keynote speaker is Director Hu Xiaozhen. He is the director of the Institute of Culture and Philosophy and is currently a researcher of the Institute.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Everyone will know after listening to his speech that he is very knowledgeable, so I am also very happy to have this opportunity today

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Enjoy this voice of his literary novel

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Director Hu is a PM from the Wanwen Department of National Taiwan University and a master of literature from De Yaguo, California.

Wu Great Excellence Award

31
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,500
This is very difficult in academia

32
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,640
An award for young scholars

33
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,300

so visible

37
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,100
He has a lot of heart on his body

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,200
His main research

39
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,100
Mainly in the literature and art of Ming and Qing Dynasties

40
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,300
and this

41
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,800
Especially in the subject of the main prize for women's literature he's waiting for

42
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
he this

43
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,200

44
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,800
I'm not here

45
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,700

46
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,800
That

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,400
The topic of his speech today will be the master. Wait until everyone sees him.

48
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,000
Chai girl, Chai girl, Chai girl and the like

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,360
His raised head is very appropriate to himself

50
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,480
It mainly focuses on the emotion and imagination of women's novels in the Qing Dynasty

51
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,600
Now, all distinguished guests, please welcome our Director Hu Xiaosheng

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,880
Thanks

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Peng Ding long

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Peng Ding long

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Dear friends inside and outside the hospital

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I am Hu Xiaozhen from Literary Institute

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It is a great honor to be invited to the knowledge feast of our Academia Sinica today

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let me share with you some of my research experience

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
In fact, there are studies on women's literature in the Ming and Qing Dynasties

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
not my new research

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Or Wu Ning said she was my earlier actor

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But I think sometimes it's a new era

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Can exchange for a new meaning

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I do research on this

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Actually from the 90s

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
but since the 90s

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and my related book published in 2003

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
in the process

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I think the acceptance of women's literature and women's issues

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
In fact, it is far from being as high as everyone's concern about related issues now.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So I want to bring this topic back here

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Come and enjoy with everyone

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
let's feel together

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's criticize together

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Maybe it still has new meaning

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So today's topic

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know what you think when you see the title

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So from talented women to talented women who are not beautiful

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Talented girls are already so tired

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
why don't you say

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
go to bed

82
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,480
why doesn't he want to sleep

83
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,160
or why can't sleep

84
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,320
in fact

85
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,640
this here

86
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,680
Words like rich girl

87
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,200
not what we usually say

88
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,640
oh so tired

89
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,760
Very sleepy

90
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,000
so tired

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,440
The class that really wants to sleep

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
what about this class

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,160
I actually borrowed one

94
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,960
American sinologist

95
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,640
Called Ronald Egan

96
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,200
Professor Ellen Knoll

97
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,040
to the Song Dynasty

98
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,000
famous female writer

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,200
Li Qingzhao's research

100
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,800
What about his original text?

101
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
is called

102
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,680
The Burden

103
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,960
one attached to him

104
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,000
something he didn't want

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,440
So

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,200
The Sinologist pointed out

107
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,240
that's not what i said

108
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,440
It's what Professor Elonor thinks

109
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,560
He said that in traditional society

110
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,720
Literary sanctions for women are a major

111
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,320
why

112
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,680
Because male literati intellectuals

113
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,640
scholars, officials, etc.

114
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,840
the entire mainstream society

115
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,320
talented for women

116
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,440
And put it on the creation of literature and art

117
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,880
this thing is not satisfactory

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,200
is biased

119
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,160
They believe that women should not engage in literary and artistic creation

120
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,920
Then the male literati are against such behavior

121
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,480
is suppressed

122
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,320
And what's worse than creating it is

123
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,640
Spread the good work

124
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,320
because for the ancients

125
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,520
A woman's handwriting is like a part of her

126
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,040
So for a person who should not put himself

127
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,080
a woman exposed to public society

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,580
If the work is exposed to the eyes of the public

129
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,120
that is also an exposure

130
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,180
So this public literary work

131
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,240
It's actually an inappropriate behavior

132
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,800
Then under the constraints of this society

133
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,080
the woman writer herself

134
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,620
no matter how well she writes

135
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,160
no matter how lonely she was

136
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,020
She has no way to feel at ease

137
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,060
spread your work

138
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,620
So most authors will choose

139
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,160
take her work

140
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,980
burn it

141
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,300
Or destroy her all before she dies

142
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,100
This will ensure

143
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,140
she is an innocent

144
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,200
pure, respectable

145
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,240
this elite woman

146
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,280
then such thoughts

147
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,840
It is completely different from our modern people

148
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,140
so what

149
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,440
The Song Dynasty was not without women's writing

150
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,260
But none of their works have been well circulated.

151
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,560
Then Professor Alan Rowe pointed out

152
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,340
Li Qingzhao is here

153
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,860
Among the many women who can write

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,500
the most special one

155
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,060
Because he not only insisted on creating

156
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,700
And he's not shy

157
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,100
even hard

158
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,860
spread your work

159
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,860
And he also tried hard to shape himself into a

160
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,360
a man of letters

161
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,360
Can sit on an equal footing

162
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,460
so as of today

163
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,400
The Li Qing Dynasty is still at the top of the history of Chinese literature

164
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,100
almost the only one

165
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,360
a woman writer with classic status

166
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,560
how to prove it

167
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,260
I don't know everyone

168
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,000
We often read news reports

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,360
about a few months ago

170
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,560
Dean Liao

171
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,100
when in the legislature

172
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,760
He was asked by a legislator on the spot and said

173
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,560
May I ask Dean Liao if you can

174
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Can you recite a few classical poems?

175
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,760
I think Secretary-General Peng must still remember

176
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,200
So what did Dean Liao say?

177
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,900
Dean Liao blurted out that

178
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,560
oh look for secrets

179
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,100
desolate

180
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,660
Qiqi miserable

181
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,160
seven seven

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,200
Right? Whose work is this?

183
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,920
This is Li Qingzhao's "Sound Man" in the

184
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,440
This is of course a drama

185
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,080
Then it can be proved that

186
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,360
even after a thousand years

187
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,120
For the leader of an academic hall

188
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,320
This Ming opera by Li Qingzhao

189
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Still one of the most classic words in his mind

190
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,720
It can be seen that Li Qingzhao, a female author,

191
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,320
A special place in the history of Chinese literature

192
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,920
But it is also because Li Qingzhao

193
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,400
His literary reputation is so great

194
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,640
So this real Li Qingzhao

195
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,000
What kind of a woman is that?

196
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,800
His face became blurred instead.

197
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,040
will be shaded and distorted

198
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,920
How to say it? For example

199
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,000
Where's Li Qingzhao?

200
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,720
Everyone knows that his husband is called Zhao Mingcheng

201
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,440
The two of them are very knowledgeable couple

202
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,160
They are very emotional

203
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,080
But Zhao Mingcheng unfortunately died in the middle age

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,540
after death

205
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,340
Li Qingzhao has nothing to rely on

206
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,040
he actually made a decision

207
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,240
He remarried

208
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,080
he remarried

209
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,400
Then he not only remarried

210
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,000
Moreover, within a short period of time, he

211
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,920
found he couldn't stand this second husband

212
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,200
So he went to sue the second husband

213
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,120
Said that he had all kinds of illegal situations

214
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,480
constant behavior etc.

215
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,840
And in the end, if you win this lawsuit, you will be able to get a divorce.

216
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,560
So what about such a life experience?

217
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,000
It was very illegal for the people at the time.

218
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,200
The first one is that remarriage itself may be stigmatized

219
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,760
The second one immediately filed a lawsuit after remarrying and said they wanted a divorce.

220
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,920
This may also be on the social news page today

221
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,800
Then let alone sending a loan

222
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,520
So for a long, long time

223
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,760
Li Qingzhao's life experience

224
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,840
Everyone doesn't know how to face him

225
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,040
Then some people started this harsh criticism

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,460
This is called nonsense

227
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,640
That is to say, this lady Li Qingzhao

228
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,500
so unruly

229
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,000
It can be seen that there is no need to read her works

230
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,500
this is a way of saying

231
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,800
Another way is to reverse

232
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,000
Maybe it's because I love her work so much.

233
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,240
So especially during the Qing Dynasty

234
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,240
There are other scholars and literati

235
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,700
I tried my best to excuse Li Qingzhao

236
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,240
To say that the previous stories are all false

237
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
Li Qingzhao didn't change the price at all

238
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,000
He always loves Zhao Mingcheng alone

239
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,500
It's for him to keep the truth and cleanliness till the end

240
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Only in this way can he be a pure and innocent talented woman

241
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,000
such an identity

242
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,500
Such an image was handed down to later generations

243
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Then we see that no matter the former

244
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,000
Or the latter understanding of Li Qingzhao

245
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There may be a considerable distance from the real Li Qingzhao

246
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,500
Then we until the twentieth century

247
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Only then did I have the opportunity to take Li Qingzhao's body

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,560
Those heavy shackles that we have given

249
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,840
The so-called Burden

250
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,720
slowly remove

251
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,880
let's meet

252
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,880
This one can see Lu Qingzhao's real face

253
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,840
We now see Lu Qingzhao

254
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,120
It is a real attempt to

255
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,960
To break through the mainstream society of the Song Dynasty

256
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,160
Some Expectations and Limitations for Your Woman

257
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,080
it can hold on to creation

258
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,440
And try hard to spread its works

259
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,280
And it doesn't just write

260
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,600
Searching for secrets deserted

261
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Qiqi residual seven seven

262
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,760
not just write

263
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,320
Walking with the book wind last night

264
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,240
sleepless nights

265
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,680
Exam Questionnaire Confused

266
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,280
Begonia is still

267
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,680
Do you know

268
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,840
Because it is green, fat, red and thin

269
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,520
right

270
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,360
Such a work that expresses personal and private emotions

271
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,960
Although moving

272
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,120
but can't

273
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,460
All on behalf of Li Qingzhao

274
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,840
Well, this Professor Elano

275
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,340
He specifically mentioned

276
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,160
for example

277
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,240
This Li Qingzhao wrote a lot

278
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,680
to reflect on history

279
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,040
even to respond

280
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,160
Works of the current situation in the great era

281
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,480
For example, he has a poem that says

282
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,960
life valentines day

283
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,320
death is ghost

284
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,560
So far, I have been thinking about refusing to cross Jiangdong

285
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,440
He said

286
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,280
to this person

287
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,720
Born as a dragon and phoenix among human beings

288
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,760
Even if you die, you are still a hero among ghosts

289
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,480
Although some people say

290
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,760
towards the time of defeat

291
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,160
Some people say you run away

292
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,000
If you escape to Jiangdong, you can temporarily save your life

293
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,360
aftereffect

294
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,720
But Xiang Yu said he would rather

295
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,560
Never want to be a waste of time

296
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,720
refused to cross Jiangdong

297
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,520
refused to flee to Jiangdong

298
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,160
So

299
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,120
Compared with what Li Qingzhao faced at that time

300
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,840
Northern Song Army City

301
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,380
The scene of hurriedly fleeing all the way to the south

302
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,700
Of course we can imagine the poem

303
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,880
In fact, it is entrusted to Li Qingzhao

304
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,360
Li Qingzhao's view on the male-dominated society of the Northern Song Dynasty

305
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,940
and dissatisfaction with the political situation

306
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,040
Then also through these big historical perspectives

307
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,620
and reflective works on politics and society

308
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,180
Li Qingzhao did win over

309
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:35,320
The position of literati who can sit on an equal footing with male literati

310
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,180
Okay, so far, I should actually be helping you read.

311
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,300
A general summary and description of recent years

312
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,620
Whether it is Chinese literature or not

313
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,460
Or the Western Sinology circles

314
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:57,600
Some New Viewpoints on Li Qingzhao's Problem in the Song Dynasty

315
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,900
then i guess this

316
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,680
You might like to watch a short video of this

317
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
very troublesome for you

318
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,440
This section is from Taiwan

319
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,120
Guo Gongliang Culture and Education Foundation

320
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,480
A Jinkun play that just ended

321
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,480
The so-called Jin Kun is on this stage

322
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,400
Some roles sing golden operas

323
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Some bloody singing this kunqu opera

324
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,320
Then this play is called "Qing Hui Lang Zhao"

325
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,400
It describes the relationship between Li Qingzhao and his two husbands

326
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,920
Of course the first husband was a spy.

327
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,720
With the second husband is the complete wish

328
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,840
Then obviously we can see

329
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,400
What about contemporary opera?

330
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,800
Make a big fuss about Li Qingzhao's two marriages

331
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,760
trying to drag this traditional

332
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,360
Really knot the burden of women's morality

333
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,560
But let's look at this first

334
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,840
After we read it, maybe we can think

335
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,080
So in the interpretation of modern people, whether we

336
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,720
We gave another woman like Li Qizhao

337
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,840
Added a new burden

338
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,440
Let's see what this passage actually is

339
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,640
An official introduction to the play

340
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,040
only 30 seconds

341
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:46,400
Okay, it's over, so I don't know if any of you guys are going to see this play.

342
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,040
But we can see from this short introduction

343
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,240
Li Qingzhao actually has a new Birden, right?

344
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,200
He is now burdened with a modern divorced woman

345
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,720
A classical image of what happened

346
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,080
is this a new

347
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
burden?

348
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,760
In my opinion it must be

349
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,160
good

350
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,240
I want to do it again, maybe I have a lot of friends

351
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,720
It's actually for Li Qingzhao

352
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,440
I was deceived by the name of that rich girl or something.

353
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,680
dont know if it is like this

354
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,840
But what?

355
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,080
Li Qingzhao is just the background of our speech today

356
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,680
Actually my topic today

357
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,200
A female writer in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, especially the Qing Dynasty

358
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,840
and a novelist

359
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,880
So why use Li Qingzhao who was sent to the generation as the background?

360
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,560
That's because Li Qingzhao happened to live in this era

361
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,760
What about the Ming and Qing Dynasties that Song Dai can tell us about?

362
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,880
make a nice print

363
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,080
Well, some things don't change

364
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,440
some things have changed

365
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,320
Compared with Li Qingzhao, a female writer in the Ming and Qing Dynasties

366
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,320
Although their creations are also restricted by many social norms

367
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
But the Ming and Qing Dynasties

368
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,420
Minsei era female writer

369
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,200
Their creative desires are more developed

370
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,920
less malicious

371
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,080
Then their works spread far and wide

372
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,800
and male literati

373
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,620
For women to engage in creative work

374
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,920
attitude changed

375
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,620
Many of them are very supportive

376
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,120
Then one more important thing is

377
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,760
Minsei era female writer

378
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,620
they form a group

379
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,040
Whether it's a group in the family

380
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,620
in the same area

381
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,240
Groups in the same area are also good

382
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,740
Groups in the same division are also good

383
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,960
or sometimes

384
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,420
just by text

385
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,840
A spiritual group is also good

386
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,960
This feeling of being a female writer

387
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,320
It was very strong during the Minqing period

388
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,280
and very important

389
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,920
Then the women writers of this period

390
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,620
some of them are wholehearted

391
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,620
to invest in creation

392
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,620
and proud of it

393
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,360
Will emphasize what kind of waste you are, please forget to eat

394
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,800
Well, of course, this responds to the second half of the title of my speech.

395
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Talented women are not beautiful

396
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,520
don't sleep in order to create

397
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,920
then we need to know

398
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,360
Ability to stay awake for a job you love

399
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,200
it's actually a right

400
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,920
It's actually not tiring

401
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,040
I don't know if you feel this way

402
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,760
I think many women working in Academia Sinica feel this way

403
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,320
Because I like this job, I don’t sleep or get tired

404
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
OK

405
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,160
Of course, I am definitely not a woman from the Qing Dynasty

406
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,360
They've gotten rid of the so-called talented women and the like

407
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,720
actually the opposite

408
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,160
They have to struggle with more so-called talented women

409
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,080
For example, can women pursue the livelihood of the people?

410
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,720
It's not just bad people's livelihood. Women don't seem to be pursuing

411
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,880
probably good in those days

412
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,300
People's livelihood should not necessarily be pursued

413
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,160
Because in that era, the best position for women may be to be

414
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,700
deep in this

415
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,980
this

416
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,540
Look inside and taste inside

417
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,620
Should not be in the public domain to shine

418
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,380
so

419
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,500
Is it a legitimate thing for these female writers to face women seeking fame?

420
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,840
Then let alone get people's livelihood

421
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,180
He works absolutely differently on women than on men

422
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,400
This may not have changed to this day.

423
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,060
For example, the status of wife or mother

424
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,640
for a woman writer

425
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,520
Search inside, we can't think of it

426
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,260
Which novel was written by a woman

427
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,560
so is it true

428
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,840
ok then i first

429
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,640
Can you sell a pass?

430
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,100
Let's start by getting everyone back from this one after dinner

431
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,040
Wake up in trouble

432
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,800
So

433
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
please see again

434
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,260
a video

435
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,260
Please go to the next PPT first

436
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,260
What I want to invite everyone to watch is the Guoguang Theater Troupe

437
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,500
sorry

438
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,760
What I want to invite everyone to read is a story called Meng Lijun

439
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,160
In 2017 is this year

440
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,560
Spring is actually our Guoguang Theater Troupe

441
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,500
just had a play called

442
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,860
Secret

443
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,960
what is the secret

444
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,400
This play is actually the story of Meng Lijun

445
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,600
1993 Yayin Xiaoji by Guo Xiaozhuang

446
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,400
starring Meng Lijun

447
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,060
then i think

448
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,400
This audience friend who may be over 40 years old

449
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,260
And the audience friends also know that Guo Xiaozhuang

450
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,400
He himself is a traditional opera

451
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,300
against a rebel

452
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,600
So the play is performed by him

453
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,060
very suitable

454
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,200
He turns you to sixty-four

455
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,700
six...six...sixty-four

456
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,360
six minutes and forty seconds

457
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,960
We started figuring out from six minutes and forty seconds

458
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,900
This paragraph is about the character of Meng Lijun

459
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
she is female

460
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,800
she posed as a man and got citizenship

461
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
is burning sun

462
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,400
Appears in men's clothing and is in official uniform

463
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,300
This is of course a golden sentence

464
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
This is the symbol of masculinity

465
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It is also a symbol of political authority

466
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
good

467
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,500
ok we see here

468
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,000
You can see this Meng Lijun

469
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,380
show a smug

470
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,300
Yang En is really full of wisdom and virtue

471
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,500
OK, let's see a comparison

472
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
good

473
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
On the left is Meng Lijun who wears men's clothing this week

474
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Miss

475
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
anxiety

476
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Air

477
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Little Miss

478
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
red yellow

479
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Tokai period

480
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
red red

481
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
anxiety

482
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
The one on the right is the emperor

483
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
is his boss

484
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
But what about the boss?

485
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I saw Meng Lijun's appearance

486
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Seems

487
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
so what

488
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Just want to quote Meng Lijun to admit his female identity

489
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And become the emperor's neicheng

490
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Well, in the end, of course, the lecherous emperor's trick did not succeed.

491
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Meng Lijun is with his fiancé

492
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
But is this what Meng Lijun wants?

493
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Where is this very reluctant emperor?

494
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
As a last resort, he must fulfill this Meng Lijun and his fiancée.

495
00:26:30,000 --> 00:27:00,000

496
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,600
In fact, it is adapted from a work called Rebirth

497
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:10,740
Fate of Rebirth actually refers to Meng Lijun and Huangpu Shaohua

498
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,600
In fact, they have been married since childhood.

499
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,640
The result is that Meng Lijun is so beautiful

500
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,440
So there are bad guys who want to

501
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,000
to his fiancé's house

502
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,020
framed

503
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,320
In this way, you can marry Meng Lijun and go home

504
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,680
Of course, this virtuous and controversial Meng Lijun would not

505
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,980
So he changed Nanzhuang

506
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,320
Went to Beijing to rush for the exam and won the first prize

507
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,380
Not only that, he also put the world's national

508
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,500
Both politics and military affairs are in the hands of the emperor and his own father

509
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,040
and this fiance

510
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,320
between applause

511
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,360
such a story

512
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,420
Then his fiancé

513
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,000
In fact, I guessed that the prime minister is a woman

514
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,540
keep wanting

515
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,840
I begged him to resume women's clothing, but this Meng Lijun was not willing

516
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,720
Because the emperor wanted to bring Meng Lijun into the harem

517
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,160
As a last resort, Meng Lijun finally became Meng Lijun and had to return to women's clothing

518
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,760
Then in the process

519
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,280
Meng Lijun was not only unfair to the emperor

520
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,880
Being disobedient to your father is even more disrespectful to your husband

521
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,680
Then this husband because he was originally

522
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,760
It was under his subordinates that Wu Zhuangyuan passed the exam.

523
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,000
Then we know that in traditional times

524
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,560
Teachers and students are very important

525
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,520
So so his fiancé must also respect him as a teacher

526
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,400
And you have to kneel down to him often, etc.

527
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,960
then in the novel

528
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,280
These episodes are described in great detail.

529
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,440
but must say with joy

530
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,960
And there is a feeling of singing and singing

531
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,000
ok so you can imagine

532
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
a plot device like this

533
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,200
In fact, it is very attractive

534
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,880
so what

535
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,080
All genres are successful

536
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
adapt this story

537
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Regardless of what we just saw

538
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Beijing opera is also good

539
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Well actually

540
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Gezai Opera has also been changed

541
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It's played by Ye Qing

542
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Everyone knows who Ye Qing is, right?

543
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
ok good

544
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Gezi Opera also has

545
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Then there are musicals

546
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Many dramas are like this

547
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Adapted the story of Meng Lijun

548
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
even

549
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
sorry am i

550
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
OK I just skipped one

551
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
even

552
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
We also saw that he still has rumors overseas

553
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
can help me point to

554
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Not the place where the manga was adapted

555
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
ok let's look at this site

556
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
This is clearly a Japanese site

557
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
On this website, he is actually selling

558
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
cartoon

559
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Let's see this comic

560
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
what is the story

561
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
new living element

562
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,200
This is Japan in the 21st century

563
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,000
Comic creations based on traditional stories

564
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And one of the subjects he chose was in solidarity with

565
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
we can see inside the cover

566
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Meng Lijun this Q version

567
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
This image of Meng Lijun

568
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
we can all see

569
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Such a story of a woman disguised as a man

570
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It actually has a rather universal appeal

571
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Even cross-cultural still has its appeal

572
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
ok, what next

573
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Back to PPT

574
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
next

575
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Then let's take a look at this work

576
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
what the hell is going on in solidarity

577
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
what is its origin

578
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
In fact, solidarity is a very typical

579
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And a classic novel written by a woman

580
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
then his works

581
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Chen Duansheng

582
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
He was a woman born in the mid-18th century

583
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
she wrote this Regeneron

584
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It's the story of Meng Lijun we just talked about

585
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Chen Duansheng was born into a very famous literary family

586
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
She followed her grandfather and father as a teenager

587
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Mother studies literature and art

588
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
From an early age she had to write

589
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
regeneron idea

590
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
she started writing

591
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I will show my mother as I write

592
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Share her creative experience with her mother

593
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
in a year and a half

594
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
She wrote 600,000 words intensively

595
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I wish I could write my thesis so fast

596
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
She wrote 600,000 words in a year and a half

597
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Later, because of changes in her family,

598
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
mother died grandpa died

599
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So she has no interest in writing any more.

600
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
This creation is interrupted

601
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,260
then he got married

602
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,660
Fortunately, he gets along well with her husband.

603
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,920
It's like living a happy life

604
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,220
Unexpectedly, accidental inoculation came

605
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,680
His husband was involved in a science factory

606
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,580
It's a case of cheating in the exam

607
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,080
We know this in traditional times

608
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,660
This is Shatou's big case, very serious.

609
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,640
then his husband escaped death

610
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,100
But he was rushed into the army and exiled

611
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,400
Poor Chen Duansheng with two children

612
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,280
was left at home

613
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,400
then he had a very, very hard life

614
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,040
sad days

615
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,120
So in his creation from Girls' Generation

616
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,760
After a 14-year hiatus

617
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,560
Chen Duansheng is in this heart

618
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,040
in great pain

619
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,760
He decided to recreate

620
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,800
as a life saver

621
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,360
He started picking up his pen again

622
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,480
Continue to finish writing the story of Rebirth

623
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,400
but unfortunately

624
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,040
he is still

625
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,240
He stopped in the middle of writing

626
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,120
Then we'll see where he parked later

627
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,200
he stopped

628
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,560
Then he himself unfortunately passed away.

629
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,680
Then finally by other female writers

630
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:17,600
Helped him finish writing the story of Meng Lijun in Regeneron

631
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,200
So this one we just said he wanted to rewrite

632
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,120
But I can't write in one place

633
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,040
Where can I not write down?

634
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,080
It's exactly the Meng Lijun we saw just now

635
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,560
His identity is about to be revealed

636
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,000
his dad

637
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,280
his fiance and even his emperor

638
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,240
all for different reasons

639
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,200
oppress him

640
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,960
Hurry up and admit that you are a woman at this critical point

641
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,120
Chen Duansheng stops here

642
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,880
We can probably imagine a suffering

643
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,360
For the plight of women's lives

644
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,120
Chen Duansheng with many reflections

645
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,000
How is he going to end this story?

646
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,500
is following the expectations of most readers

647
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,840
Like most dramas we have seen

648
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,720
Make Meng Lijun happy

649
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,760
Unload the jade belt and unload the tide view

650
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,760
Change the beautiful hair of women on the book

651
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,120
Put on Jinchai and put on a skirt

652
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,520
change back to female

653
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,960
can she write like this

654
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,120
Or Chen Duansheng in the eighteenth century

655
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,880
He might write Meng Lijun as saying

656
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:39,760
No, I definitely don't want to give up my old political life?

657
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,080
It seems that Chen Duansheng has no choice

658
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,120
Choose from either

659
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,320
Indeed he stops here

660
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,560
The female writer who later helped him finish writing this work

661
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,440
Of course it was written with a happy ending

662
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,700
What about this work by Chen Dunshen?

663
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,200
Although he himself did not finish

664
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,760
But in this Jiangnan area

665
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,880
In fact, it is very widespread

666
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,880
It is a situation of manuscripts, manuscripts, manuscripts, and manuscripts being circulated

667
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,380
And his influence is very big

668
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,540
At his time and in later generations there were many women writers

669
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:26,500
respond to his work in different ways

670
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,420
Well of course we have to stop here

671
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:34,660
Let's take a look at the form Chen Dunshen used to create

672
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,060
If he is writing a novel

673
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:41,420
Why did we not know that women in the Qing Dynasty wrote novels before?

674
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:46,620
That is actually because the novels created by Chen Dunshen have a special form

675
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:52,740
He is a person transformed from Tan Ci's performing and rapping form.

676
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,140
a dark-headed written work

677
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,340
It's called Tan Ci's novel

678
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,100
Let's take a closer look

679
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,440
so what are the words

680
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,960
Simply put, Tan Ci is popular in the Taihu Lake Basin.

681
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:13,320
Especially Suzhou, today's Shanghai, and so on, a kind of rap art of the generation

682
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,920
This kind of rap art is mixed

683
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,760
just sing in rhyme

684
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,920
but also uses some prose to tell part of the story

685
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:29,360
Sanxian and pipa are used to accompany the performance

686
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:35,680
Then the style of Tan Ci is very delicate, soft, and even sleepy.

687
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,160
So it is still a very popular art form today.

688
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,440
And Tan Ci novels are many women who love this art form

689
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,360
transformed into a form of writing

690
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:55,120
Well, maybe not everyone here has heard what Tanci is

691
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:00,120
So I took a very old route from decades ago

692
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,600
Let everyone know what is marble

693
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,320
wait a minute

694
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,800
Let's take a look at this picture in the upper left corner

695
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,960
This is the form of the manuscript of Tanci novels

696
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,120
These works are often in the form of manuscript transcripts

697
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,360
published after a long time

698
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,160
Then the performance form of Tanci is like

699
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,960
This image we see in the lower left corner

700
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,280
There will be one person or two people

701
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,160
Perform with a stringed instrument

702
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,360
But you should pay attention

703
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,160
In fact, in the traditional era

704
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,360
Those who can go to the stage to perform Tanci

705
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,160
absolutely not

706
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,760
they must be men

707
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,000
Only men can go to the bookstore to perform

708
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,320
Women can only go inside the house at most

709
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,920
to perform in a private venue

710
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,280
good

711
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,400
Then let's take a look at a short

712
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,560
this

713
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,160
an older video

714
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:59,960
What about this paragraph?

715
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
It's a lady talking to a maid

716
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,500
Maid ran over

717
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,640
no it's another

718
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,000
The maid ran over and reported to the lady that

719
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,500
Your fiancé is here, go out and see

720
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,300
But what about this maid, he didn't directly say

721
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,200
He deliberately teased this lady

722
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,200
gossip

723
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,000
This funny lady is angry and funny

724
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,200
I'm sorry

725
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,200
So according to their conversation

726
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,300
we can see the performance of this korean word

727
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,300
So yes, it has both dramatic tension and lingering

728
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,700
Official Jade Flag

729
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,600
Wow

730
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,800
you hurry up and send it again

731
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,200
Whoosh, go feed yourself

732
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,700
you go kick it

733
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,700
post it

734
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,300
hello it

735
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,300
stranger it

736
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,600
because tactics step it up

737
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,400
Haha good area

738
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,400
who wants to send it

739
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,200
nibbling

740
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,200
say it

741
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,900
i want without it too

742
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,600
it's one of you girls here it is

743
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,400
I dust wash my aunt

744
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,640
Not many sighed loose powder

745
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,980
fresh girl holes it

746
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,500
"!

747
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,900
Then thank you for teaching me to move you

748
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,080
Listen to individual words

749
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,360
Thank you for your teaching and forgive him

750
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,560
a parte

751
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,340
That one is more self-satisfied than he does not move tiy

752
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,880
i don't listen to her

753
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,120
legs

754
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,360
choose her

755
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,700
ditch

756
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,000
It's not appropriate to say it's all a secret

757
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
the main kid

758
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
you are the wind of flowers

759
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
have to do

760
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
very nice

761
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Said it was all hard work

762
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Miss threatened that you are here and I will beat you

763
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Miss said you want to call

764
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,240
Okay, then we can see this Tanci performance

765
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,360
It's actually very dramatic.

766
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,600
We can't imagine with our present eyes

767
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,760
You're putting yourself in an eighteenth century

768
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,720
Women who returned to China in the depths of the 19th century

769
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,360
if you see a show like this

770
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,240
you will actually be touched

771
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,280
And it's really going to be fun, right?

772
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,040
Well, if you still remember that Dream of the Red Chamber was in the very front

773
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:32,000
Isn't Jam talking to a so-called fairy girl?

774
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,960
They invited this female performer to their home

775
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
Are you here to perform?

776
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,640
Then the fairy girl said

777
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,600
Otherwise, I will sing the story of Fengqiu Huang

778
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,520
remember

779
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,400
So that performance should actually be something like ours

780
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,480
I saw such a performance of Tanci

781
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,320
So we can actually imagine

782
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,040
At that time, there were quite a few returned women.

783
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,000
will be rewarded for seeing such a performance

784
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,400
Attract some of these women who are educated to write

785
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,200
She thought I could use this format to create a story

786
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,000
We know that storytelling is actually a human instinct

787
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,400
Especially women love to tell stories

788
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,000
So that's how the novel of talking words came about.

789
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,600
And compared to the performance of talking words in the performance we just watched

790
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:32,800
There will be more textual parts in real talk novels

791
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:39,800
The design of the characters The description of the characters will be more detailed and the plot will be very complicated

792
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,000
Just like Zhang Hui’s novels like Dream of the Red Chamber and Oil Absorbent that we usually see

793
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:53,600
It must also have Zhang, Huihui, Huimei, etc., which have all the necessary conditions for novels

794
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,400
The structure is also very complete

795
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,200
But it will use seven fonts

796
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,860
tell stories in english

797
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,220
Therefore

798
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:07,700
So when we take the concept of the so-called novel

799
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,540
Fixed in the so-called vernacular Zhang Hui novels

800
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:14,900
Then there is no place for this novel

801
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,460
so that's why

802
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:19,060
This is what we've been taught since childhood

803
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,580
in the education of literature

804
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,980
no one told us

805
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,340
It turns out that women in the Qing Dynasty wrote novels

806
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,900
called talking about this novel

807
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,820
So

808
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,300
maybe you want to ask

809
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,540
Are there any Zhang Hui novels written by women in vernacular?

810
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,860
Actually not without

811
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,860
At least we know that in the second half of the nineteenth century

812
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,740
There is an aristocratic woman named Gu Taiqing

813
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,540
she actually wrote a

814
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:47,940
The narrative book of Dream of Red Mansions is called Dream of Red Mansions

815
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,140
shadow of shadow

816
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,700
But this is a very special case

817
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,820
What about women writing Zhang Hui's novels?

818
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,260
almost unique

819
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,020
Then this Dream of the Red Chamber is probably

820
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,600
is a rare example

821
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,840
And in contrast

822
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,320
What about Tanci novels?

823
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,720
There are quite a lot of women to create

824
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,920
You can count more than ten or twenty kinds by random counting.

825
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,320
then we're going to ask

826
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,800
Why Women Don't Write Zhang Hui's Novels in Vernacular

827
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,880
And choose this form of Tanci to write novels?

828
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,000
Of course, there is no standard answer to this.

829
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,480
I can only make some guesses

830
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,440
So first of all what we just said

831
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,040
Because the performance of Tanci has a kind of attraction

832
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,640
then women like to hear

833
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,480
Then it's natural to say

834
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,440
I use this form to create

835
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,640
Other women may also like to watch

836
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,080
right

837
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,680
So this could be a

838
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,360
The psychology of expecting other women to enjoy reading

839
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,440
this is one of them

840
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,400
i think one of the reasons

841
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,560
Another reason?

842
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,280
Tanci itself is a kind of entertainment

843
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,360
it is unrefined

844
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,560
What about this male literati?

845
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,040
for

846
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,300
It is simply dismissive of women to write in this form

847
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,440
That is to say, I will not read it at all.

848
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,700
won't go to see

849
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,800
so is that a good thing or a bad thing

850
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,040
hard to say right?

851
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,880
It's a bad thing because it doesn't get more attention

852
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,420
but it's a good thing

853
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:23,800
Because he left a lot of room for these women to run wild horses

854
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,400
If we carefully read the thoughts written by these women

855
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,400
say what we will see

856
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,800
This language is really when writing talk novels

857
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,080
It can get rid of many talented women and the like

858
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,760
many of them in other forms such as poetry

859
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,820
For example, emotions that are inconvenient to write in words

860
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,680
ambivalence or even desire etc.

861
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:53,040
or some really wild imagination

862
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,040
It can all be written in the form of talkative novels

863
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,200
and get letters from other women

864
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Standards and norms of mainstream society that loves men without offending them

865
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
This is another possible reason I think

866
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
So anyway what I have to point out here is that

867
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Whether it is Li Qingzhao in the Song Dynasty or the female writers in the Ming and Qing Dynasties

868
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Or the female novelists of the Qing Dynasty like Chen Duansheng we have seen here

869
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Writing is a creative activity for them

870
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:39,000
is a way of pursuing an immortal possibility for oneself

871
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
We all know that Confucianism says that there are ways to pursue immortality in life.

872
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Three Immortals

873
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Thank you Lide for your meritorious service

874
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So what can we do to build morality for women?

875
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
If the husband is not dead, he can't be robbed quickly, right?

876
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,680
If meritorious service cannot go to the public domain

877
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,040
how do you do meritorious service

878
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,800
The only thing to say is that it is locked in the defense

879
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,400
It is also possible to engage in a creative activity

880
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,840
Then women pursue this kind of

881
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:20,920
After you can let your own body go to ashes

882
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,920
It is also possible to exist in pursuit of immortality

883
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,920
such a way

884
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,840
Well, this is a common ultimate pursuit of human beings

885
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,960
Then the so-called talented women are not ignorant

886
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,960
Awareness of unwillingness to sleep

887
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:40,520
It was born from such an impulse to pursue immortality.

888
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,040
good

889
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,440
Then I think we might as well come together

890
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,120
Look at the text of the section inside the solidarity

891
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,440
So just now we introduced the author who is in solidarity

892
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,000
Chen Duansheng

893
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,560
then we also know

894
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,520
different from current writers

895
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,080
Today's novelists, of course

896
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,640
I went everywhere to type books

897
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,900
But the novelists of the classical age

898
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,480
In fact, I am very conscious of what I write

899
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,460
is an art called trail

900
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,000
It's not in the hall of the big government

901
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,960
So even male authors

902
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,640
are often reluctant to disclose their identities

903
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,320
Well, let alone women

904
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,320
And for Chen Duansheng

905
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,960
He's still a sinner's wife

906
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,280
right

907
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,000
We just said his husband was exiled

908
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,520
So even though he is a comedian from a famous family

909
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,600
But our whole background about Chen Duansheng

910
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,480
Actually don't know much

911
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,520
So how do we know there is a protozoa?

912
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,000
Written by this woman named Chen Duansheng

913
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,960
He will never be like a modern writer

914
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,440
He mentioned his name on the fertilizer industry

915
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,600
how did you do it

916
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,000
how do we know

917
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,120
That's because the author

918
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:56,080
He will use a form of speech

919
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,280
And at the beginning of each chapter

920
00:49:59,280 --> 00:49:59,920
or

921
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,340
Going to write a long paragraph at the end has nothing to do with the storyline

922
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:07,920
But with his own current feeling

923
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,200
or seasons or circumstances or experiences

924
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,920
Or words related to his mood

925
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,600
Then we can see from this paragraph

926
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,520
This paragraph is the beginning of volume 17

927
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,640
Volume 17 is exactly what Chen Duansheng wrote in his

928
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,880
14 years off

929
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,640
After he has gone through all kinds of hardships in life

930
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,400
the volume that started writing again

931
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,680
Let's see him at the beginning of this volume

932
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,000
how to describe yourself

933
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,680
Then please read the text on the PPT directly

934
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,480
then he said

935
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,160
What about him

936
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,400
Shaking my head to ask God

937
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,840
Why is the law of heaven so unfair?

938
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,840
ask the sky

939
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,680
he is here

940
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,680
In fact, it is a rhetoric that follows Chu Ci Tianwen from afar

941
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,160
Yeah

942
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,000
express a

943
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
a sorrow of life

944
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,240
He said I've grown out of all the troubles in the world

945
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,240
So I miss returning to the center even more

946
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,160
when young

947
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,480
that carefree era

948
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,840
what did he do at that time

949
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,960
He said me and my sister

950
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,280
sleep together

951
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,880
Let's listen to the sound of rain at night

952
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,760
Mom and Dad teach us to do our homework

953
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,400
teach us how to make poetry

954
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,080
This is what parents teach their daughters to write poetry

955
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,440
This is the cultivation of talented women in Ming and Qing Dynasties

956
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,480
a very common situation

957
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,280
In other words, although they don't necessarily go to school

958
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,040
But they can learn from family education

959
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,240
get artistic training

960
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,440
Next he said when I was young

961
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,400
Follow my father out to be an official

962
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,120
Then I have experienced many mountains and rivers

963
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,200
what about father

964
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,120
My parents love me very much

965
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,160
Although in my literature and art

966
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,600
There is no way to talk to this kind of rich girl who has not entered the era

967
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,480
For example, who is Everlasting Wealth?

968
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,400
Xie Daoyun

969
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,280
I can't talk to Xie Daoyun

970
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,480
Or another rich woman who wrote flowers to send

971
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,040
This Ms. Chen

972
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,040
compared to

973
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,280
but

974
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,200
He said I can't compare

975
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,320
In fact, I want to compare

976
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,560
Do you guys know this rhetoric?

977
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,080
Fama

978
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,680
OK

979
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,160
Although I am not as good as them

980
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,120
And what?

981
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,000
The tube system in my pen is my pen

982
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,520
Do I dare to write the eternal things in my pen?

983
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,720
do i dare to go

984
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,520
Just like Li Qingzhao we mentioned earlier

985
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,240
to reflect on history?

986
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,160
Oh I dare not

987
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,600
I don't dare to say it, but I really want it

988
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,880
then what do i dare to do

989
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,240
Haoduan writes in solidarity

990
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,120
then we see here

991
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,920
he used a small word

992
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,040
This fine print is true on the one hand

993
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,360
because he was a child

994
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,880
he is a teenager

995
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,080
writing seemed to him

996
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,400
yes it's a game

997
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,760
But on the other hand this fine

998
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,320
Too

999
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,840
It is a kind of original intention of creation

1000
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,640
without any power

1001
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,560
i just want to write

1002
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,000
i just want to create

1003
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,760
I just wanna make up a story

1004
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,480
Then Cheng Duansheng at this time is very lucky

1005
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,160
Because my loving mother saw what I wrote

1006
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,560
Will smile lovingly to teach me

1007
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,360
what should be done

1008
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,760
Then I eat children

1009
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,720
My silly daughter is by my mother's side

1010
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,120
I told her my dreams

1011
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,240
But since my mother died

1012
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,600
I am no longer in the mood to write

1013
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,200
I put down my pen

1014
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,040
Then I omitted a large part in the middle

1015
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,320
It's really very long

1016
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,720
and after

1017
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:44,920
I went back to my hometown with my family

1018
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,040
It's the boat that goes back home

1019
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,680
the boat goes very slowly

1020
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:52,040
So I have a lot of time to waste

1021
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:52,840
then what should we do

1022
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,320
I will take out the manuscript of my novel

1023
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,280
I wonder if I can write again

1024
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,960
Born to be a leisurely man, if I have nothing to do, I will write again

1025
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,320
At this time, in fact, I have misled some religious truths.

1026
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:11,560
Which means I don't want to follow the right path in life.

1027
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,600
What is the right way, what is the right way for women

1028
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:18,640
That is, you want to be a daughter, a father, and a mother, right?

1029
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,200
He said I don't want 'cause I misled some zen

1030
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,640
Then everyone should pay attention to the fact that in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the pursuit of religion

1031
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,600
also become a very very important one for women

1032
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,600
The so-called ultimate pursuit is to surpass oneself

1033
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,600
A way of gender limiting

1034
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:40,600
Well, Chen Duansheng also said the same thing, it's a pity that Ke Nai is still in the vulgar world

1035
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,800
At this time, he has no way to break through absolutely

1036
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:50,400
The so-called right way of life for women, this life plan added to him

1037
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,400
So he's still married. After marriage, it's just like vulgarity.

1038
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,400
here we see marriage is what we see here

1039
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,400
A Life of All the Women Writers

1040
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
turning point

1041
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,840
However, Chen Duansheng was very lucky at the beginning

1042
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,440
He said my Wengu was good to me

1043
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,680
my husband is a confidant

1044
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,200
We light up and half read

1045
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,960
On the one hand, he is in charge of checking, and on the other hand, I accompany him to study.

1046
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,600
Not only that, we also remind teachers

1047
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,440
Burn out the candle

1048
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,360
Let's compete who can do things faster

1049
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,520
we can imagine how

1050
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,440
A happy homely couple

1051
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,640
Of course, this should also remind us of

1052
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,880
The relationship between Li Qingzhao and Zhao Mingcheng

1053
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,280
This is a so-called

1054
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,120
contemporary scholars call it

1055
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,080
A relationship of partner marriage

1056
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,440
That is to say, in the traditional marriage system,

1057
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,080
Originally between the couple

1058
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,200
Seems like there's only one kind of family obligation

1059
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,360
But what about partner marriages?

1060
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:52,600
But it can create a kind of mutual understanding between couples

1061
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,800
not only have feelings

1062
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,120
And this cultural exchange

1063
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,480
this way of marriage

1064
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,600
Therefore, Chengzhuan students in this period

1065
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,320
Not only a successful marriage

1066
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,440
And there are descendants

1067
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,920
for him at this time

1068
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,200
It's really the end of life

1069
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:17,120
It's a pity that his husband was forced by the so-called force

1070
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,640
Minjiang is asking Ke Ming

1071
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,120
to pursue a career

1072
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,360
and apparently committed a crime

1073
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,080
It's the section chief's fraud case.

1074
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,480
he can't say here

1075
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,600
because the first aspect is embarrassing

1076
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,480
The second aspect we just said

1077
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,560
The section chief's case is a major case, Shatou's crime

1078
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,200
Therefore, Chengzhuan is not obvious

1079
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,480
then the end is

1080
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,760
Here he uses two images

1081
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,760
One is to break the suspicion and the other is to break the ban

1082
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:53,200
Of course both point to a broken marriage

1083
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,160
symbol of an unhappy marriage

1084
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,200
Then under his husband is another

1085
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,160
He didn't say it directly but we could read it

1086
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Group eyes open outside the setting sun

1087
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
His husband was exiled far away

1088
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
no longer with this family

1089
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And it's one of the sidelines

1090
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
sad exile

1091
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
What about Chen Duansheng?

1092
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Of course he's been sad ever since

1093
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
This mark is messed up

1094
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
He said that for many years

1095
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
He is in a state of extreme distress

1096
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
What about him, there is no way to reciprocate

1097
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
The relationship between his husband and him

1098
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
he can only watch

1099
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
His two sons and daughters worked hard to survive

1100
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
then he said for him

1101
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
this home he lives in

1102
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
like a castle

1103
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
lock him in

1104
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Let him be a hatred

1105
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Although he wants to fly to her husband's side

1106
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
But there's no African American, right?

1107
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
There is nothing he can do about Fengyan

1108
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
reunited with his husband

1109
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
You see we read from this text

1110
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
We can probably see that Chen Duansheng narrated

1111
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
he grew up

1112
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
This literary training in the rules

1113
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
The practice of literature and art between parents and sisters

1114
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
life after marriage

1115
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
his relationship with his husband

1116
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
misfortune suffered by his husband

1117
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
and his own fate

1118
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Is it all written in this paragraph?

1119
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
So this master of the twentieth century, Mr. Chen Yingque

1120
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
He will be able to follow the clues here

1121
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
To compare some other historical records of the Qing Dynasty

1122
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
to compare

1123
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
And finally came to this conclusion

1124
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
is the author of Regenerated Source

1125
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
It's Chen Duansheng

1126
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Then such a form of creation

1127
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
We can see that

1128
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
this is the author

1129
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
He is writing a novel on the one hand

1130
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
But on the one hand he is writing about himself

1131
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
He couldn't help but write himself in

1132
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Because he was really afraid of writing it himself

1133
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Just this area of ​​flesh and blood is invincible with the disappearance of his life

1134
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I think it's a very, very deep kind of fear

1135
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
because of this fear

1136
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
So these women have an urge to create

1137
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
We just said that the previous part of this regeneration source

1138
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
That is to say, the first sixteen volumes were written by this Chen Duansheng when he was a young girl

1139
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:34,000
The order of this section of the seventeenth volume has a

1140
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Looking at the role of experience in the first half of your life

1141
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
The cultivation of this talented woman she described here

1142
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
and their married life

1143
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,000
In fact, among the talented women of Ming and Qing Dynasties, they are quite representative.

1144
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
We can also see Chen Duansheng here

1145
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
His entire narrative voice changed

1146
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Because you only see this part, so you can't feel it

1147
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,700
If we read from the first volume

1148
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,860
we will clearly see

1149
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,500
Chen Duansheng the author

1150
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,300
when he was the narrator

1151
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,800
His tone changed completely

1152
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,960
from a clueless

1153
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,660
very happy to write

1154
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:15,960
just for the game

1155
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,700
Just to make mom happy like this one

1156
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,660
innocent girl

1157
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:23,960
transformed into a person who experienced Tibet

1158
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,460
And one who is very dissatisfied with society

1159
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,920
middle-aged woman

1160
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:32,620
An image of a woman who has experienced Tibet

1161
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,960
So

1162
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,220
He can no longer use a kind of tenderness

1163
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,020
or the attitude of the game

1164
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:44,220
To face this fate of women

1165
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:44,920
good

1166
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,560
Then we can see here

1167
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,920
What about Tan Ci's novels?

1168
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,120
he has a lot of space in him

1169
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,660
What about the women of the Ming and Qing Dynasties?

1170
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:57,120
can express one's true self

1171
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:08,640
Next, let's take a look at the development centered on this Regeneron.

1172
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,360
A whole series of romance novels about love for women

1173
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:17,120
Regeneron, we are the first to talk about it is definitely not without reason

1174
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:22,400
because it is a true classic of women's love fiction

1175
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:29,040
Not only is the work itself complete, but the plot and characters are designed

1176
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,880
are very attractive

1177
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:40,400
It also has topics that many women will find interesting

1178
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:46,880
So centered on Regeneron we can see that there is a network of text

1179
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,720
a web with a text

1180
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,120
In this web we can see female narrative literature

1181
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,040
A Development Track of Women's Novels

1182
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:58,440
There are several key points in this track

1183
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,040
what are the key points

1184
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,400
First, women are going out into the public domain

1185
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:11,640
The second is to establish a personal public enterprise, a personal industry

1186
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:20,200
The third is to explore the multiple possibilities of women's feelings and even friendship

1187
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,920
Fourth, we must pursue the ultimate meaning of human life

1188
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,200
These key points will be included in these many works

1189
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,360
constantly being repeated and performed

1190
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,120
Of course, these are works of the Qing Dynasty

1191
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,280
So it has the limitations of its age

1192
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,680
So we said just now that there is a prerequisite for going out and establishing a public company

1193
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,680
It's just that it doesn't do these things as a woman

1194
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,920
It has to be like what we just saw

1195
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,880
Meng Lijun from the small country village, right?

1196
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,400
it must be dressed as a male

1197
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,840
with a masculine mask after wearing a masculine mask

1198
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,160
He was able to get out of the boudoir, he was able to build an industry

1199
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,460
He is able to pursue lust and so on

1200
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:08,700
These are a necessary design

1201
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:11,740
So what you see on the screen

1202
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:15,500
Almost all works involve a key to the plot

1203
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,340
it's called crossdressing

1204
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,800
and as we have just said

1205
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,920
The Female Writers of the Ming and Qing Dynasties

1206
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,580
There is a big difference between them and the female writers of the Song Dynasty

1207
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:35,660
That is, women in the Ming and Qing Dynasties would actively pursue a sense of community

1208
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,820
No matter the community is our whole family girls can write

1209
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:43,820
Or the female literary talents in our Huxiang area are very powerful

1210
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,740
Or our talented women in Hangzhou are very powerful, etc.

1211
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:50,120
They will pursue a sense of community

1212
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,220
This is of course for our contemporary

1213
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:55,420
We are all so familiar with community culture in modern times

1214
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:56,660
For example, we are now live

1215
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,620
Maybe everyone who is watching the live broadcast

1216
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,420
feel that they are in the same

1217
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,360
In the same field even though we are far apart

1218
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:06,840
So this feeling is actually

1219
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,840
Women in the Ming and Qing Dynasties were also pursuing

1220
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,520
So how do they pursue

1221
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,520
They certainly don't have modern technology

1222
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,020
But what, they can text

1223
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,240
they will text

1224
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,200
and responses to the text to create this sense of community

1225
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,040
This is a literary community

1226
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,320
Then the renewable source is such a kind

1227
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:29,600
A center for an imaginative literary community

1228
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,200
Then we can probably see

1229
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,080
In fact, the source of reproduction is not an isolated work.

1230
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,760
before it was

1231
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,920
This may not be the head

1232
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,440
This is the earliest header I can trace back so far

1233
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,880
Two works called Big Money and Little Money

1234
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,800
Together they are called making money

1235
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,440
We don't quite know when exactly it works

1236
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,280
So is the author really a woman?

1237
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:57,240
I'm not sure yet

1238
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,320
but likely

1239
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,040
Then after this there is a

1240
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
A work called "Jade String Garden"

1241
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,500
I'm pretty sure it's a woman's work.

1242
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:09,500
Then in "Jade String Garden", there is also a talk about female companions and men's clothing

1243
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:13,000
Well, when Chen Duansheng wrote "Reborn Circle"

1244
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,500
He started by saying

1245
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,800
I read a book called "Jade String Garden"

1246
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,000
very nice

1247
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
But I'm very dissatisfied with his ending

1248
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,700
There's a woman in it that I think is pretty good

1249
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:28,000
Didn't get a very fair treatment in the ending

1250
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I think there's a sense of injustice in this

1251
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,800
so i'm writing a new novel

1252
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:38,700
To reverse the case of a female character I identify with

1253
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:46,600
This is his motivation for writing "The Reborn Circle" in the first place.

1254
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,000
Because of this, his novel is called "Reborn Circle"

1255
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:50,600
right

1256
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,500
Because his heroine Meng Lijun

1257
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:57,800
In fact, she said it was a secondary character in "Jade String Circle"

1258
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,800
what is it called

1259
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,240
afterlife afterlife

1260
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,520
I can't remember what it's called in Chinese

1261
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,520
that is

1262
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:13,440
afterlife

1263
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,600
OK good next life

1264
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,240
good

1265
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:18,680
Then he is using such a form

1266
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:22,200
to create his Regeneron

1267
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,360
Okay, so we can say that Regeneron is

1268
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,160
A sequel to Yu Chuanyuan

1269
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,080
But he's not a sequel

1270
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,680
he's a whole new story

1271
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,760
So on the one hand

1272
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,720
He did inherit the elements in Yu Chuanyuan.

1273
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,320
some characters

1274
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,360
but

1275
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,040
He's not like Yu Chuanyuan

1276
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,640
on the basic spirit

1277
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,720
Unlike Midenmoto

1278
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,960
Because of Yu Chuanyuan

1279
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,000
What about the woman he wrote about in disguise?

1280
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,240
is a comparison

1281
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,280
Um

1282
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,480
Well

1283
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,520
It's just for plot advancement

1284
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,720
It's just for this man and woman to get together

1285
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,640
He's not really trying to explore women's potential

1286
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,000
or possibility

1287
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,760
This Meng Lijun written by Chen Duansheng

1288
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,240
He wholeheartedly wants to be here

1289
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:09,160
The image of Meng Lijun he created has made a big fuss

1290
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,800
He wants to explore through Meng Lijun

1291
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:15,360
The various possibilities of this woman's life

1292
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,760
then we must also say

1293
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,400
In this earlier novel

1294
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,800
If the hero and heroine can get married and have a happy reunion

1295
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,040
that's perfect

1296
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,080
don't say anything else

1297
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,640
that's a perfect ending

1298
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,520
But for Chen Duansheng

1299
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,600
that's not the end

1300
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,000
So we see that there are

1301
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,040
very very long episode

1302
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:39,680
It's describing Meng Lijun's repulsion

1303
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,280
push the final destination

1304
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,120
he keeps

1305
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:47,120
If Meng Lijun admits that marriage is his final destination

1306
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:52,720
In fact, he is constantly working hard to delay the arrival of this end point.

1307
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:56,320
This is the most important part of the regeneration councilor

1308
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,920
At the same time we must also note

1309
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,480
in this novel

1310
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:00,040
his maiden

1311
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,400
Instruct Huangfu Shaohua, we just said that he is a student of Meng Lijun

1312
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:09,000
Therefore, we must put on a very aggressive attitude in front of Meng Lijun

1313
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,400
but no matter

1314
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:16,800
In the novel, Huangfu Shaohua is a man who refuses to marry because of Meng Lijun

1315
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,800
Don't we sound moved?

1316
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,800
If it was a female reader at the time, she would say

1317
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,300
I'm so touched. There is absolutely no such man in this world.

1318
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,400
should think so

1319
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,900
But if we look at it with the eyes of modern people

1320
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:32,500
Huangfu Shaohua in this novel has been in his first service for three years

1321
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,100
It is not confirmed that Meng Lijun is dead, he refuses to get married

1322
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,200
Is it just for mood?

1323
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,100
just for love

1324
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:41,000
maybe more than that

1325
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,100
especially when he saw that his teacher

1326
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:45,300
That is, the prime minister

1327
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,300
Possibly his fiancée

1328
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:51,300
And when he was trying to bring Meng Lijun back to his family

1329
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:54,400
In fact, his real pursuit is not just love.

1330
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,200
It is the restoration of a restored family

1331
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:57,700
right

1332
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,900
It is a recovery system

1333
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,160
Consolidation again

1334
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:06,040
masculinity again

1335
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,920
Don't blame me for being so negative about rehab

1336
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,200
The character Huang Fu Shaohua

1337
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,200
well then

1338
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,400
OK, so we see this cross-dressing design

1339
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,760
In this garden of regeneration and her previous works

1340
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,320
has undergone some changes

1341
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:26,760
And in the later works of this series

1342
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:30,840
She's still going to have a lot of renditions

1343
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:34,000
But her effect will be different

1344
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,720
I'm very rough here

1345
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:42,080
Some of the works I have experienced are divided into two series

1346
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,000
The series on the left is

1347
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,520
It can be said to be the sequel to Garden of Regeneration

1348
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,000
That is to say

1349
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,240
The female authors of the series on the left

1350
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:55,440
They all publicly said that I watched Garden of Regeneration

1351
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,880
i am moved or i am dissatisfied

1352
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,280
That's why I wrote a new work

1353
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,400
to respond to him

1354
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:05,600
So the works on the left are all directly responding to the regeneration source

1355
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,680
And the series on the right

1356
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,200
They appeared a little later

1357
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:15,480
Probably until the middle or late 19th century

1358
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:19,280
they didn't say directly

1359
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,600
I'm because I watched the regeneration source

1360
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,480
That's why I came to write my novel

1361
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:26,240
But the traces of the middle influence

1362
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,080
It's actually very obvious

1363
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,400
if we look at it in the future

1364
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,080
Then through the investigation of these two series of works

1365
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:38,520
If we focus on the issue of cross-dressing,

1366
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,520
We can really see the different times

1367
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,760
and female authors who think differently

1368
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,200
for the same problem

1369
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,920
What different ideas would they come up with

1370
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,160
or the solution

1371
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,280
Well, I'm actually in a hurry

1372
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,240
I try to be as fast as possible

1373
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,080
Let's take a look at the one on the left

1374
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,600
first part of the series

1375
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,640
This one is about a female writer called "Liang Deshen"

1376
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,360
Didn't we just say this

1377
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,320
"Chen Duansheng" has not finished writing "Rebirth"

1378
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,640
just passed away?

1379
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,800
Then everyone feels a pity

1380
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,520
Because at that time, "Rebirth" was a

1381
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,400
Works that are very popular with readers

1382
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,480
no ending

1383
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,240
This is like the drama you watched

1384
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:25,680
It turned out that the last episode was locked.

1385
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,720
This feeling

1386
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,360
Okay, so everyone feels so sorry.

1387
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,320
So there was a Ms. Liang Deshen

1388
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:36,000
She was actually a

1389
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:42,480
An older one of the female literary world

1390
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,840
leader

1391
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,480
Then because she is older

1392
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,480
So her attitude is of course relatively peaceful.

1393
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,240
She will not be like "Chen Duansheng"

1394
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,640
after all the suffering of life

1395
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,200
There is a sense of grief and indignation

1396
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:58,800
So what Liang Deshen has to do

1397
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,800
is to flush this out

1398
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,240
Works full of women's grievances

1399
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:05,640
give her a softer ending

1400
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,160
so in general

1401
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,200
modern reader

1402
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,160
readers not necessarily

1403
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,560
modern critics are very dissatisfied

1404
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,360
The last ending written by Liang Deshen

1405
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,200
they all feel

1406
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,760
Doesn't this put this regenerated MP

1407
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,240
Is this story written too often?

1408
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,520
So if we look at it from a modern perspective

1409
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,640
indeed

1410
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,080
But Liang Deshen, with one

1411
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,160
Compare older women to women to write the story

1412
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:34,240
He's not without what he's read

1413
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:37,560
For example, we just saw the show and knew

1414
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:42,880
This proverb is very suitable for describing delicate feelings

1415
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,360
and inner reading

1416
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,120
Then actually read the truth

1417
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:50,440
It is relatively rare in traditional Chinese novels

1418
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,280
Except Hong Luomeng

1419
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,400
we rarely see

1420
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:57,240
A large section of inner psychological changes

1421
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,680
but Tan Ci novels

1422
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,160
Because of the psychology of this Tanci performance

1423
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
gave the writer this convenience

1424
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Let's say we see here

1425
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
In this passage he wrote

1426
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Meng Lijun and his fiancé Huangfu Shaohua

1427
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
What about after the team member?

1428
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
know this classic novel

1429
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
In fact, that has all kinds of things

1430
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
So there is another

1431
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
a little lady

1432
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
This little lady was already in

1433
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Huangfu Shaohua is here

1434
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
But Huangfu Shaohua refused to marry him

1435
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Said that I must find Meng Lijun

1436
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
So he was already fed up, right?

1437
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Seeing this Huangfu Shaohua and Meng Lijun

1438
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
get married

1439
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
He was alone on the wedding night

1440
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Sitting alone in his home

1441
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
what does he think

1442
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
he faces

1443
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
to the candlelight

1444
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
silent

1445
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Must be a woman of the world

1446
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
So I can't make noise, right?

1447
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I can't go to barbarian

1448
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
But I'm really worried

1449
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
This Meng Lijun used to be prime minister

1450
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
and he is so fierce

1451
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
what would he do to me like that

1452
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And what about this Huangfu Shaohua?

1453
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,840
I used to be so good to him but he refused to marry me

1454
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,160
Is he affectionate or heartless?

1455
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:09,360
If this Meng Lijun is an idle person, I'll forget it

1456
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,520
What the hell would I do if he wasn't a slob

1457
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,720
I'm helpless

1458
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:15,880
Because his father is a treacherous minister, he has been arrested by this

1459
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,920
has been wrecked

1460
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,400
ok then we can see

1461
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,560
Through this Ms. Liu's inner monologue

1462
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,200
In fact, Liang Desheng showed us

1463
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,960
a traditional polygamy

1464
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,160
polygamous family

1465
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:35,600
A woman in a family with wives and concubines

1466
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,760
A complexity in his heart

1467
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:43,040
He is not like the kind of wives and concubines written in this series

1468
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,200
What are you going to do with poison?

1469
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:48,400
Or throw some other party's child to death?

1470
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,240
take the dog to bite him

1471
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,520
no he didn't write like this

1472
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:53,720
He will tell you how ungrateful and fierce this heart is.

1473
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:54,520
This is enough

1474
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,000
good

1475
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,920
This is a detailed description of female psychology by a female writer

1476
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,400
look at the next example

1477
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,760
This is another female writer named Hou Zhi

1478
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:12,000
She is also a woman who has the position of leader in the female literary circle

1479
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,560
Her husband is soft round student

1480
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:18,640
This Hou Zhi is very, very interesting

1481
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,200
she's a super complicated woman

1482
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:25,160
On the one hand, she has to put on a

1483
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:28,800
She is a female teacher gesture

1484
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,240
So she wants to teach women to obey the rules

1485
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,360
You know what? If you don't follow the rules

1486
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,000
there will be riots

1487
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,320
but on the other hand

1488
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:41,120
she's done some really weird things herself

1489
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,800
For example, she obviously belongs to a famous family

1490
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,880
But she was able to contact the publisher

1491
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,840
Help Her Publish Commercial Publishing

1492
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,000
help her publish her novel

1493
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,680
Did you know that Chen Dunshen did such a thing?

1494
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,560
absolutely not

1495
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,920
so we can see

1496
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,760
A traditional woman, he has many complex layers

1497
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:06,340
We really can't learn from what he said

1498
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,920
or what he wrote to judge him

1499
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,160
You have to put him together on all levels

1500
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,440
He will be a three-dimensional person

1501
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:17,600
Well, this Hou Zhi has actually rewritten Fate of Rebirth

1502
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,720
What about after he rewrote it?

1503
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,720
he rewrites , so he has to read , right

1504
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:25,120
What about women, they are the best readers for women

1505
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,840
As for Hou Zhi, he read it completely

1506
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,360
The Charm of Chen Duansheng's Fate of Rebirth

1507
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,840
But he also read about his danger

1508
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,480
Because after seeing the fate of rebirth, it will be in the hearts of women

1509
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,920
planted a seed of uneasiness

1510
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,800
Then as a life coach

1511
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,800
Hou Zhi like this, he thinks he can't do things like this

1512
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,080
So, he wrote another novel

1513
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:53,520
The novel is called Reinvention

1514
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,360
That is to say

1515
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,400
Simply put, the story of Rebirth

1516
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,920
with his subsequent role

1517
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
It's like breaking the sky

1518
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:08,080
Break the harmony of the world, yin and yang, men and women

1519
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,520
I have to make it up again

1520
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:13,800
So he wrote this book called "The Novel of Reinventing the Sky"

1521
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:14,800
It says

1522
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,680
This Meng Lijun married Huangfu Shaohua and gave birth to a daughter

1523
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,680
Just as smart and beautiful as him

1524
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:21,520
only

1525
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,480
Because I was spoiled by Mr. Meng Li

1526
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:28,600
So her temper and her ambition are more out of the ordinary than Meng Lijun

1527
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,720
This daughter said since she was a child

1528
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,680
i want to be a dancer day

1529
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:35,800
if

1530
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,360
when we are now affected by zero sequels

1531
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,600
So if your daughter says she wants to be a dancer

1532
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,320
you may be happy

1533
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:43,320
but

1534
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:44,520
I know

1535
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,080
but

1536
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,920
To be a dancer in this novel

1537
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,040
this is a very serious matter

1538
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,120
really

1539
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,280
This daughter will really become a queen

1540
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:55,360
After becoming queen

1541
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,240
She is really heading towards becoming a dancer step by step

1542
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,920
go to this goal

1543
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Of course, this country is in turmoil and the world is in chaos.

1544
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,000
In the end, the warehouse that caused this piece of land needs to be cleaned up.

1545
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
what about this time

1546
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
This mother, Meng Lijun, appeared

1547
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Because the focus is not on Meng Lijun's daughter

1548
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,000
What kind of earth-shaking things did you do?

1549
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
The focus is on the character Meng Lijun

1550
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
how to reflect on your past

1551
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Let's see, this is another inner monologue

1552
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
what about here

1553
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
This Meng Lijun

1554
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
His daughter has been in this terrible disaster

1555
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Meng Lijun says

1556
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Back then, I just wanted to be an official

1557
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
my mother is sick

1558
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
dying

1559
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,000
I couldn't bear to see her

1560
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
my husband fiance

1561
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
because miss me miss me lovesickness

1562
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
dying too

1563
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I am not only not moved

1564
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,660
He hates me and I think he loves the world

1565
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:06,660
Then I just think about my husband insisting on me being with him

1566
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,160
where is my fiancé

1567
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:11,460
my student my student insisted that i marry him

1568
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:13,200
is a disgraceful thing

1569
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,800
I'm a teacher, how can I marry my student?

1570
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:21,660
Then I completely ruined this family of mine.

1571
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,000
he he is my daughter

1572
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,160
My daughter wants to learn from Wu Zetian to steal the country

1573
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:29,660
what about me

1574
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:33,000
Back then, I was just practicing for the position of prime minister.

1575
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,660
I'm right, uh, to the emperor, to my father, to my husband

1576
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:39,400
so disrespectful

1577
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:40,660
think about it now

1578
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,060
Everything that's happening now is retribution

1579
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:47,000
It's all because of my bad behavior in the past

1580
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,060
So I'm suffering now, uh, totally deserved

1581
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:53,200
Wasn't what I did before just like Qingshou?

1582
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,300
No wonder what my daughter is doing now is more vicious than tigers and wolves

1583
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:56,900
good

1584
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,600
Although I am talented

1585
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,040
I though

1586
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,080
Conspiracy

1587
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:04,840
Although I never thought of harming anyone before

1588
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:05,840
but

1589
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:06,680
as a female

1590
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:10,360
What I absolutely shouldn't be is that I'm greedy to blend in

1591
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,560
I shouldn't just think about being an officer

1592
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:13,920
have to wait

1593
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,320
Then I won't talk about it

1594
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,680
I mean, my daughter is like this now.

1595
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:20,000
I must strictly discipline my granddaughter

1596
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,400
must make her a

1597
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,280
Well-Being Women

1598
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,760
Well, this is Hou Zhijie

1599
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:29,080
Meng Lijun's

1600
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,240
Meng Lijun reflects on his own words

1601
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,480
to deliver a message to his readers

1602
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,040
right

1603
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,720
no matter how talented you are

1604
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:36,920
but you can't

1605
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:40,680
Obsessed with some so-called civic principles

1606
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,640
Of course here we have to say

1607
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:43,440
Wait a minute

1608
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,840
This Ms. Hou, you completely misunderstood our Chen Duansheng

1609
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:48,120
Meng Lijun written by Chen Duansheng

1610
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:50,240
Is he just greedy to fit in?

1611
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:50,840
no

1612
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,920
He is pursuing a life pursuit

1613
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:55,200
why don't you see that side

1614
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:55,920
because of this

1615
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,640
So contemporary readers and critics

1616
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,240
Regarding what Hou Zhi wrote in

1617
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
In Zhaotian, of course, I don't particularly like it.

1618
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
but even so

1619
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
i still have to say

1620
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
if we revisit this

1621
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
"Hou Zhi" wrote that when the sky was shining

1622
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
we can see

1623
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
When Hou Zhi imagines someone who wants to do

1624
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
The time of women in "Five Folds"

1625
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
His writing actually reveals unconsciously

1626
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
a mood

1627
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
a pleasure

1628
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
So as for the last

1629
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Meng Lijun's self-reflection

1630
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
cannot dissolve the middle of this novel

1631
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
all those for this woman

1632
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
I want to do "50% off the sky"

1633
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
the will to rule the world

1634
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
not digested

1635
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Then this is Zai Zhaotian from "Hou Zhi"

1636
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
We can see that it is a negative response

1637
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
then look at this

1638
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
This is about the nineteenth century

1639
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
A woman in the late

1640
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
She also watched "Rebirth"

1641
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
was very moved

1642
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
she likes it

1643
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,240
But he also has a point

1644
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:07,800
His opinion is not about the Meng Lijun created by Chen Duansheng.

1645
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,880
This wants to be an official so much

1646
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,120
his opinion is not here

1647
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,520
This, Qiu Xinru's opinion is

1648
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,120
This Meng Lijun is too unfilial

1649
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:21,960
Because Meng Lijun refused to restore women's clothing

1650
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:27,560
So his parents were very, very worried

1651
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,840
And still seriously ill

1652
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,360
Well, Qiu Xinru thinks that everything else is easy to say

1653
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:36,520
People can't let their parents worry so much

1654
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:39,240
So at this point, he can't accept it at all.

1655
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:43,640
So he thinks, this dream of Meng Lijun's life

1656
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:45,160
he appreciates it very much

1657
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,720
But he thinks Meng Lijun is an imperfect character

1658
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,800
So he wanted to create a character

1659
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:54,800
It has the material of Meng Lijun

1660
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,960
Can reach the same height as Meng Lijun's industrial

1661
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,160
at the same time

1662
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,500
is a perfect person

1663
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,500
So guys, do you think this is possible?

1664
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,500
Everyone is so optimistic

1665
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,000
Y'all, I thought everyone was going to say no way right away.

1666
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,000
It's really hard

1667
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
So

1668
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
This Qiu Xinru is here

1669
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Bishenghua Bishenghua means this book is very good, right?

1670
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Myohi Ikebana

1671
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
he is here

1672
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
What about a character created in Bishenghua's novel?

1673
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,500
In all respects

1674
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,500
Whether it's character settings

1675
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,500
As far as his life experiences are concerned

1676
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:33,500
In fact, they are all very, very similar to Meng Lijun

1677
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,500
The only difference is

1678
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:38,500
What about the character he created?

1679
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,500
He will not be like Meng Lijun

1680
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,500
use so firmly

1681
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:45,500
And violently collide with the system

1682
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,500
what about his female character

1683
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,500
is taking a

1684
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:52,500
On the one hand, work hard to make contributions

1685
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,500
On the other hand

1686
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,500
What about your words and deeds?

1687
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,500
Trying to

1688
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:59,500
an image that tries to constrain

1689
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,220
Let's take a look at a short

1690
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:06,100
This is his heroine

1691
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:09,180
It's the same thing again, heartbroken

1692
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:15,380
He said that this is also the pressure he faced to restore women's clothing

1693
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:17,660
His parents and so on told him that

1694
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:18,980
you can't go on like this

1695
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:23,300
Mom and Dad are in jail, need to hold grandchildren, etc.

1696
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:24,580
he's under a lot of pressure

1697
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:27,900
So he said it doesn't work

1698
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:29,820
had to forget

1699
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:31,820
I have to make a copy

1700
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:34,460
I have to go back to being a woman

1701
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:36,980
Looks like I have to get married, right?

1702
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:38,500
blow off cross seam

1703
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:41,020
This was supposed to be a perfect marriage

1704
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:42,540
A symbol of a happy marriage

1705
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:44,740
If you congratulate someone on their marriage today

1706
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:47,100
It should be good that you write blow off the cross seam

1707
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:47,780
but

1708
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:50,380
But he said blow off the cross seam thing

1709
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:52,740
makes me very depressed

1710
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:53,980
Next he said

1711
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:57,300
If women in this world get married

1712
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:00,060
there are so many unfree places

1713
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,200
This is of course compared to his time in the past

1714
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,900
It's this male freedom I've ever enjoyed

1715
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:11,120
He said that even if someone exposed

1716
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,560
i am female

1717
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:14,640
Even if things leak

1718
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:17,320
Then I have to take off my male officer

1719
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,400
And the records of women in the book

1720
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:21,760
Even so

1721
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,920
I'm fine, I don't want to get married

1722
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:24,920
as long as you don't get married

1723
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:26,200
because as long as you don't get married

1724
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,960
I won't have those detentions.

1725
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,120
Although my heart is so

1726
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:34,280
But my mom and dad won't let me do that

1727
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:36,560
They don't think it's a good life

1728
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,480
So when my parents ask me

1729
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:41,560
I can't help it, I have to listen to them

1730
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,360
Because if I don't listen to my parents

1731
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,920
that would be so disrespectful

1732
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,560
so so i thought

1733
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,520
I know my ambition in this life

1734
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:54,120
I'm afraid there is no way to really achieve it.

1735
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,520
so we can see

1736
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,520
this

1737
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:00,160
The woman in Bishenghua

1738
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
The biggest difference between her and Meng Qianjun is that

1739
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
She will pass through one of her own

1740
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
What happens after the rational one becomes difficult?

1741
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
she will take orders from women

1742
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
She will put her dissatisfaction, wish

1743
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Feelings of injustice are buried

1744
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And with a mask

1745
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
put on a mask and come out

1746
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
to face her future life

1747
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
This is mentioned in Bishenghua

1748
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Another option

1749
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Of course this solution for us

1750
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
seems to be less than perfect

1751
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
In Bishenghua, in fact

1752
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,000
She also kept describing the heroine over and over again.

1753
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
she went to the end

1754
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Until the end of this novel

1755
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
She is a last resort

1756
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
such a mood to face

1757
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Let's look at a very extreme example

1758
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
This is a really nice example

1759
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
We just said that there are many female

1760
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,840
are constantly responding in various ways.

1761
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:06,480
Some of the proposed

1762
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,840
The Dilemma of Women's Lives

1763
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:13,080
Then it is true that the later the nineteenth century

1764
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:17,000
There will be more and more strange answers

1765
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,840
really weird answer

1766
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,880
They will experiment with different ways of unraveling

1767
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,760
then imagine

1768
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:29,640
The consequences of various ways of unwinding

1769
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,040
So let's look at this example

1770
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,960
This work is called "Flower Dream"

1771
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:36,000
it has many special places

1772
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,560
first it's not this

1773
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,840
Created by the women of Jiang Zhe's generation

1774
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,640
The author is Li Guiyu

1775
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:47,400
He actually grew up in Shaanxi when he was a child

1776
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,120
Then when he grows up

1777
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:55,880
He went all the way from the west to the far south and got married in Fujian

1778
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:58,720
So he himself is saying that he has passed

1779
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,080
a long time

1780
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
In the end it settled in Fujian

1781
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Liu Huameng was created when he was in Fujian

1782
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
How many pieces of Liu Huameng are there? How many times?

1783
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
There are 360 ​​times

1784
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,000
How many words? About 5 million words

1785
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,000
This may be the longest Chinese novel we now know

1786
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Do you think there is such a book

1787
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
And our books none of our textbooks tell us

1788
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
is that right

1789
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Such a creation of 5 million words

1790
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
not an obscure work

1791
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
In fact, according to records in the Fujian area

1792
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
it's a very very famous

1793
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
and popular works

1794
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
how popular is it

1795
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
same it has no way to publish

1796
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Because it is too much, it cannot be engraved

1797
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
think about it

1798
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Gou Taiming may be needed to sponsor

1799
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
In that era, Guo Taiming came to sponsor

1800
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
it's going to cost too much

1801
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
So no matter what to do, use super

1802
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,560
Spread in the form of Gaoben

1803
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:04,120
How popular can it be?

1804
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,480
In fact, there were bookstores in ancient times.

1805
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,400
Rent a bookshop in the nineteenth century

1806
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:11,080
"Flower Dream" is one

1807
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,120
at least hateful works

1808
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:14,640
That is, everyone wants to rush

1809
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,440
works to rent

1810
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:17,240
besides

1811
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:19,200
Another effect is

1812
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,240
it can be turned into a property

1813
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:22,240
what kind of property

1814
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:23,360
it is

1815
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,880
part of dowry

1816
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:25,720
That is to say

1817
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,880
when a girl was young

1818
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:28,880
she copied it herself

1819
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,120
or at home

1820
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,840
Sisters and mothers help to copy

1821
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,120
let her get married

1822
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:36,080
You can bring "Liuhuameng"

1823
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,080
extra

1824
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,520
become her own

1825
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,840
part of the property

1826
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,160
and may be transmissible

1827
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:43,160
We record from such

1828
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,080
you can see

1829
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:44,880
This is a

1830
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,440
how to get attention

1831
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:48,680
and favorite works

1832
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:49,720
Interestingly

1833
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:50,920
In fact, the author did not

1834
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,440
finish this work

1835
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:56,400
He probably wrote up to 357.

1836
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,480
He wrote three hundred fifty-seven

1837
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,800
die before writing

1838
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,080
later in the twentieth century

1839
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,600
Only two modern female writers helped her finish writing

1840
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:06,720
But because it was written to 357, the overall situation is actually determined

1841
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,720
So she is not the same as Regeneron

1842
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:15,360
Chen Duansheng of Zaiyuan wrote a key point and stopped

1843
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:18,920
And Liu Huameng didn't stop until the end.

1844
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:23,320
In fact, the latter can be completed with a little bit of hard work.

1845
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:26,640
The big picture of the novel has not been changed

1846
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,720
This novel has 5 million words

1847
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:31,160
Of course I can't tell you what she's talking about.

1848
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,840
too complicated

1849
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:36,800
She is involved in the stories of at least three generations of several big families

1850
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,280
So it should be called Family Saga

1851
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,840
This is the Yamato novel

1852
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:46,320
There is no way to effectively introduce to you

1853
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:49,560
I just point out that in this

1854
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,840
There are also stories about women disguised as men

1855
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:52,840
and more than one

1856
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:54,800
It can be said that it is a string of star conferences

1857
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:57,040
That's almost all the female characters in it

1858
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,920
She's been through one in her life

1859
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,400
stage of masculinity

1860
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:02,200
And what?

1861
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,960
through cross-dressing

1862
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,600
achieve a certain success

1863
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,280
what about inside

1864
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,760
there is a first heroine

1865
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,160
called

1866
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,000
girl

1867
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,520
when she is a female name

1868
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:13,760
Her name is Guibifang

1869
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,080
when she was male

1870
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,760
Her name is Gui Hengkui

1871
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:17,680
anyway this one

1872
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:18,400
this this

1873
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,520
this expensive

1874
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:22,640
ma'am or mr.

1875
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:23,600
what about her

1876
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:24,560
yes

1877
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,240
The author wants to shape a past and present

1878
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,680
An image of the most remarkable woman

1879
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,920
so is she the best

1880
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,480
Everyone is going to read the novel

1881
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:34,720
to be able to judge

1882
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,960
What we want to emphasize here is that

1883
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,120
what about this woman

1884
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,720
She is because she disguised herself as a man

1885
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:43,320
Whether it is literary or intellectual

1886
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,480
Martial arts are also good

1887
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,480
She is a master of ancient scriptures

1888
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:47,600
that's awesome

1889
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,240
How powerful is this emperor?

1890
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:49,640
take her

1891
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,400
The story is set in the Tang Dynasty

1892
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,160
So it's proven

1893
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,040
what about the emperor

1894
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:55,600
seal her as

1895
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:58,120
should be Guangxi

1896
01:31:58,120 --> 01:31:58,640
sorry

1897
01:31:58,640 --> 01:31:59,960
because it's been a while

1898
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,400
a bit unsure

1899
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:06,600
In short, Yunnan and Guangxi are a big town in the southwest

1900
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,160
it is a king

1901
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,720
to this point

1902
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:11,760
so what's interesting

1903
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,000
Its identity will still be revealed

1904
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,440
when it is exposed

1905
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:19,280
It was forced to give up its status as the king

1906
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:22,560
it's getting married to its fiancé

1907
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:26,080
And it has to give up his throne to its husband

1908
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,800
And it becomes a Queen itself

1909
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,360
a queen

1910
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:31,240
a queen

1911
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,520
not a queen

1912
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:40,480
Then of course this lady is very reluctant

1913
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:43,080
Well, there is a very interesting description in the novel that says

1914
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,120
How reluctant is he?

1915
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,880
He's not willing until he actually dies

1916
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:49,880
What about his true soul?

1917
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:52,240
just lightly

1918
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:54,520
Arrived on a fairy mountain

1919
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,520
Of course we know that in the traditional

1920
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:59,240
Often there is a frame of this discount

1921
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:00,040
That is to say, it would have been

1922
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,000
He is a fairy, because he committed a crime, so he was brought down to the world to walk around

1923
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
So is this lady

1924
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
After his journey of conquest of the soul arrived at Xianshan

1925
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
The owner of the fairy mountain there told him

1926
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:18,000
It's not your time yet, take this pill obediently

1927
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
you'll be fine

1928
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
sorry , two pills

1929
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:26,000
This pill is called... what?

1930
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Qin Dan

1931
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Why is it called Qindan?

1932
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,000
It means to be in the heart of this noble lady

1933
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Plant a seed that can develop the love between men and women

1934
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Only in this way can he start his marriage with his husband

1935
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:54,000
In other words, the relationship between men and women did not exist for him.

1936
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,000
It is to allow him to continue his life on earth for a period of time

1937
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
So there is only one...

1938
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
a divine power an external force

1939
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
planted in his heart

1940
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
and it's temporary

1941
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
OK good

1942
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
I think this imagination is more

1943
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Jueqin Valley

1944
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
what's more interesting

1945
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
then he eats this

1946
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
What about after this heavy sheet music?

1947
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
What about him? He was originally because

1948
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
He vomited blood and died because he was too

1949
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Sad and angry, that's it

1950
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I am the only one in this Botian industry

1951
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
I saved up for nothing

1952
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Give it to someone else and I don't love him at all

1953
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Well this he too

1954
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Sad and angry, so what?

1955
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
He has this blood clot in his chest

1956
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
What about the condensed air of blood?

1957
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
he passed out because of it

1958
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
he ate this

1959
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
What about after this heavy sheet music?

1960
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
His blood clot melts away

1961
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
melted temporarily

1962
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
so he didn't die

1963
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Just go back to the human world and continue to do his work

1964
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
queen

1965
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
so we can

1966
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
So even close blood

1967
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Exhausted, originally filled with grief and indignation

1968
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
At this time, it's only temporary

1969
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
got one

1970
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
but only temporarily

1971
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
This novel has another very special

1972
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
It is he who writes about women's desire in a positive way

1973
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
the heroine

1974
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Although she has no love between men and women

1975
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Her relationship between men and women is outsider

1976
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
But she has another feeling

1977
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
and lust

1978
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
object of this affection

1979
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
not her husband

1980
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
But her boudoir secretly has a woman

1981
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
And of course this woman

1982
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
We're going to go back to this traditional situation again

1983
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,000
This woman is actually her husband's second wife

1984
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Also her cousin

1985
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,000
So her feelings are all pinned on

1986
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
on this sister of hers

1987
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
So how far-fetched is this feeling?

1988
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Their feelings are for each other

1989
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
This cousin and this lady

1990
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
They used to be female companions in male middle school together

1991
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
What we see are two

1992
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
beautiful great general

1993
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
killing

1994
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
fight on other fields

1995
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Once Miss Bea

1996
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Seriously injured, it looks like it won't work

1997
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
same with his cousin

1998
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Wearing armor is the image of a male general

1999
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
My uncle described it

2000
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:24,000
This cousin heard that your general

2001
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
dying

2002
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
His heart is like a knife

2003
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
he vomits blood immediately

2004
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
And it's like blue blood

2005
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
call my brother

2006
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Because the two of them are dressed as women and men

2007
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
call my brother

2008
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I can't live anymore

2009
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Uncle said

2010
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Poor Suspicious Girl

2011
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Xietu Qingpeng has died

2012
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
This cousin was so sad that she died.

2013
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
How loving the children and sisters were

2014
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Entering the ghost gate with you until death

2015
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
we can see this narrative

2016
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
What kind of intensity should be used to describe the relationship between these two women?

2017
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
What about this feeling?

2018
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
I said Dream of the Red Chamber

2019
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
is still crying

2020
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
What about the feelings in this flower dream?

2021
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
is blood

2022
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
It will always use bright red blood

2023
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,000
to express the relationship between the two women

2024
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Concentration and intensity of emotion

2025
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
what about a scene like this

2026
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Actually more than once

2027
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
to the second half of the novel

2028
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Where is this heroine, this noble lady?

2029
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Because of the love pill she ate

2030
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I can only save her for a while

2031
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
What about after it works?

2032
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
She can't stand this vulgar creature

2033
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
so she has to leave

2034
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
So it means to die

2035
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
what about after she died

2036
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Where's her cousin?

2037
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
no way to accept

2038
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
same she again

2039
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
she can't live

2040
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
The novel is about this cousin

2041
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Kiss yourself with a sword

2042
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
under the light wind like the wind

2043
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
She kisses this and wipes the neck directly

2044
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
when you put him to bed

2045
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
he is almost dead

2046
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
The narrator tells us again

2047
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
between the two of them

2048
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Wanlu Love

2049
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Wanlu Love

2050
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Entanglement can never be untied

2051
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
This and that heavy engine list

2052
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
The weighted seed grows a tiny seedling

2053
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
after twenty years

2054
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
It's totally different

2055
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
their love is

2056
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
getting tighter

2057
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Then this cousin is using his blood

2058
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
to pay back this cousin

2059
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
give him affection

2060
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
But he's not dead yet

2061
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Did not die for the sake of

2062
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
describe this feeling

2063
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
deep and his

2064
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
the will to repay his feelings with death

2065
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
firm

2066
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
So soon after

2067
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
where is this cousin

2068
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
she deliberately

2069
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
a large banquet venue

2070
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
It's when the whole family gathers

2071
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
He ascended he ascended one of the houses

2072
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
tall building

2073
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
opened the people around him, and then he committed suicide by jumping off the building

2074
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,420
this time it worked

2075
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:08,580
In the novel, he committed suicide by jumping off a building

2076
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:11,760
He sprinkled blood on the face

2077
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:15,600
Achievement party name is only for love

2078
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,600
In this "Liu Hua Meng"

2079
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:21,000
We can see what he describes

2080
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,080
i want to be in

2081
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:28,000
I believe I haven't seen it in any other Chinese classical novels

2082
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,380
I think if in our time

2083
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:35,680
Now let's talk about gay literature or same-sex relationships

2084
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:38,400
when so much attention

2085
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:39,880
such a work

2086
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:42,460
it actually has to be noticed

2087
01:39:42,460 --> 01:39:48,240
This is a work from around 1840 in the 19th century

2088
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:50,280
it can be so strong

2089
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:52,120
so direct and so hot

2090
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:56,000
to write about same-sex relationships

2091
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,760
And it's placed under the frame of a female partner's men's clothing

2092
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,120
We can also see that I exceed a very large amount of time

2093
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:06,000
But I think you guys should let me finish, right?

2094
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,680
ok we can see

2095
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:11,120
it has some very interesting descriptions

2096
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:17,360
Not only the intensity that just described this emotion

2097
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:22,440
At the same time it also shows you the intensity of this lust

2098
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,240
We just talked about this novel

2099
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:27,520
because it has this female companion

2100
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,920
Reverted to the design of the plot like a female

2101
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:34,760
So the relationship between the two heroines is in

2102
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:40,600
Women, women, men, women, among the various possibilities

2103
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,840
so let's look at this

2104
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:45,240
This description is talking about

2105
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:48,760
Both of them are still dressed as men

2106
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:50,680
Of course they know each other is female

2107
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,640
But outsiders think they are men

2108
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:55,640
so one of them

2109
01:40:58,280 --> 01:40:59,800
he is also married

2110
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,400
we'll talk later

2111
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:03,400
In this story of a woman disguised as a man

2112
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:06,400
This woman who is accompanied by a man must marry

2113
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:07,700
because if she doesn't get married

2114
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:09,100
she can't hide

2115
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:11,800
The fact that she is female

2116
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:13,200
So we look here to say

2117
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:13,900
one of them

2118
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:17,000
where is this lady

2119
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,300
What about the lady in men's clothing?

2120
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:19,600
just tell her cousin

2121
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,400
your sister-in-law is my wife

2122
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:22,600
I went to the palace today

2123
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:23,200
so what

2124
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:24,900
my room is empty

2125
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:26,900
do you want to come

2126
01:41:26,900 --> 01:41:28,300
So

2127
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:29,400
I treat you as

2128
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:30,700
I put my good brother

2129
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:33,300
Just treat yourself like you are a beautiful jiao'e

2130
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:35,600
In fact, she is simply a beautiful Jiao'e

2131
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:38,100
what about after bed

2132
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:40,400
this brother this sister

2133
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,500
I don't even know how to describe her

2134
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:43,600
please imagine

2135
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,800
because of the

2136
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:45,700
her game

2137
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:47,900
Her sex game is too complicated

2138
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:49,500
she just said

2139
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:52,300
let me take your hat off

2140
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:53,600
let me take off your shoes

2141
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:54,400
is it cold

2142
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,500
I'll cover you with the quilt

2143
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:57,000
Then what

2144
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
after falling asleep

2145
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,100
this brother this sister

2146
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,540
He saw this sleeping

2147
01:42:02,540 --> 01:42:06,800
What about this girl with a world-class face?

2148
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:10,320
He said he saw my brother drunk

2149
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:11,600
red face

2150
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:12,920
so beautiful

2151
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:17,960
I spread this back into me pulling my beloved brother

2152
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:20,160
We are like a pair of mandarin ducks

2153
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,640
hold here

2154
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:24,000
so connected

2155
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,600
It's really beautiful, just like this water

2156
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:30,920
Compassion is average, right?

2157
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:33,480
Flowers are not as beautiful as female genuine

2158
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:34,920
Oh by the way

2159
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,400
Let me explain by the way

2160
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,720
Both of them know that they are actually

2161
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:40,280
a man's fiancee

2162
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:41,440
they are cousins

2163
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:44,400
At the same time, he was engaged to his cousin

2164
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,840
So he said Huan Lang

2165
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,200
Huan Lang is their common wedding dress

2166
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:50,400
He said such a beautiful person

2167
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,600
our maiden dress

2168
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,400
He hasn't touched it yet

2169
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:54,800
it was me first

2170
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,640
Ha ha ha ha

2171
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:57,480
it was me first

2172
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:59,480
I'm Hengkui, I stand first

2173
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,000
It's a pity, if we get married one day, I'll have to give it up to someone else.

2174
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
It's like Wang Wei, right?

2175
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Such a beautiful person, I actually want to give it up to someone else

2176
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
instead of my beloved

2177
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
it's a pity

2178
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,000
So we see this inside

2179
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,000
On the one hand, he is lust, on the other hand, he is emotion, and he is a comrade in arms

2180
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,000
He's another competitor with men

2181
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,000
There are too many layers

2182
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,000
It is our identity as a contemporary reader that can be imagined

2183
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:33,000
It's fun, but time is of the essence and I have to hurry up to the bottom

2184
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I'm going to talk about this faster and faster.

2185
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
This is the 1860s

2186
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,000
The deduction of this era, this drama is really getting faster and faster

2187
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:47,000
After the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom War in 1861, Jiangnan was dilapidated

2188
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
But we have seen a work like this

2189
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:55,000
a female author who took advantage of

2190
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Taking advantage of the war in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom

2191
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
because of her mother

2192
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,580
In the chaos of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom?

2193
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:05,580
Scared. Simply put, had a stroke.

2194
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:06,780
scared to have a stroke

2195
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:08,780
so bedridden

2196
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:10,380
So what about this woman?

2197
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:12,880
she very conveniently

2198
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:15,580
That's great, I solemnly say

2199
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:17,880
Then I won't get married, I'll stay and take care of mom

2200
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:22,780
She took this opportunity to escape marriage

2201
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:25,520
she will stay in this family forever

2202
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,220
Even after her mother passed away

2203
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:28,720
she is still not married

2204
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:31,520
But stay in this native family

2205
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,020
she has been creating all her life

2206
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:35,920
She wrote a novel called Goldfish Garden

2207
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:39,520
And there is a heroine called Qian Shurong

2208
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:40,400
let's see this

2209
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:43,600
The same former Su-yong's inner monologue

2210
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,640
She said that my former Shurong

2211
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:46,740
me as a woman

2212
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:49,140
I can only hug Lulu for the rest of my life

2213
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:50,480
nothing counts

2214
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,640
what is this

2215
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:52,840
i don't want to live like this

2216
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:55,620
This is called walking towards the world

2217
01:44:55,780 --> 01:44:59,320
I must proudly mark the name

2218
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:00,120
i don't want to live

2219
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,600
Disillusionment is like Chengdu must leave something in the world

2220
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:08,240
Then he said that there are so many high-minded people in this history

2221
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:10,960
Talented women, I want to be like them

2222
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:12,760
I want Wan Gu Yangming

2223
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:16,000
What about such a volunteer?

2224
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:21,760
There are also women in the novel we have seen before, right?

2225
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,360
but they are hard to do

2226
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:24,520
isn't it

2227
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:28,160
They all have to finally come to terms with going back to being women.

2228
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:31,520
The fate of returning to the family's duty

2229
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:33,440
So what do we say about this

2230
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:38,560
The following is compared to the author's own choice

2231
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,080
I think he's very autobiographical

2232
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:42,040
He said

2233
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:50,360
Husband loves wife, loves wife, respects, suffers from dementia and conceives daughter to fuck

2234
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:54,400
Love, evil, evil, Xiao Nan, respect for the future

2235
01:45:54,400 --> 01:46:00,160
With the so-called bubble talk, I fell into a pitfall

2236
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
no sea swimming pool

2237
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,800
Such a rejection of marriage

2238
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:10,000
There must be factors of the whole society at that time behind it

2239
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:13,400
Then we also mentioned

2240
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:19,200
This is also supported by a certain kind of religious transcendence pursuit

2241
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:24,000
So on the one hand, it wants to escape from the secular society

2242
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,600
and home network

2243
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,500
On the one hand, it seeks a higher

2244
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:34,500
No matter whether it is construction or spiritual, it is a kind of transcendence

2245
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,300
So can it be done?

2246
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:40,100
In the 1860's it became doable

2247
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:42,900
Then in this goldfish garden

2248
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:45,100
This heroine named Qian Shurong

2249
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:48,300
She's with a woman who shares her ambitions

2250
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:51,300
This woman is her woman who married her

2251
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:54,500
These two people will be a man and a woman all their lives.

2252
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:59,500
This kind of image has lived leisurely for a lifetime

2253
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Before this kind of imagination, no female writer dared to think like this

2254
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:09,000
So here we are seeing the change of the times

2255
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:12,000
The same as we just said in this story

2256
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,000
A woman who disguises herself as a man must marry

2257
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,000
So the point is how do you design this

2258
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,000
A woman who marries a woman accepts the marriage

2259
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Then each author will have a different imagination

2260
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Then the setting in the goldfish garden is

2261
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,000
The woman she married and what she thinks

2262
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Almost everyone thinks that marriage is meaningless to marry a man

2263
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
we are fine

2264
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,000
The two of us are good friends and close friends

2265
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
We walk through life hand in hand like this

2266
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,000
How good are the two of them?

2267
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,000
so good that their relationship will gradually simulate

2268
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,000
or even beyond the intimacy of husband and wife

2269
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
For example, this section of Tianmian

2270
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,000
This is Qian Shurong, the female companion who wears men's clothing. She is on a business trip.

2271
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
then left her beloved lady at home

2272
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Then the lady said

2273
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Whoops I'm lying in my yard all over

2274
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,160
I miss him so much, I can't help crying when I think about talking about wolves

2275
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:07,360
thinking about him all night

2276
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:10,800
I'm like this girl who lost his partner

2277
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,000
can't fall asleep

2278
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,960
My beloved has been away for so long and has not heard from me

2279
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,200
I'm really lovesick, I've lost weight

2280
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:21,640
Then such an emotional description

2281
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:24,480
If we pull him out of his veins

2282
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:26,320
you will feel that this is a

2283
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:30,360
An ordinary display of love between husband and wife, right?

2284
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:33,120
Or let's look at the following sentences

2285
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:36,200
This is writing about this former Shurong

2286
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:39,320
he will be very flirtatious

2287
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:43,160
He will use sweet words to make his wife happy

2288
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:46,200
Then the lady scolded him and said

2289
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:48,320
Your girlfriend is only a year old

2290
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,240
you feel like this

2291
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:51,400
this exile

2292
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:56,080
You are such a fool, suck this gray shoe

2293
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:59,760
Joke, have you forgotten your real face?

2294
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,480
What is the original face?

2295
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:03,800
You're a woman, of course.

2296
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:04,340
good

2297
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:05,800
but the problem is

2298
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:09,700
If the imagination of the story says it's going to succeed

2299
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:10,600
That is to say

2300
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:14,900
This Qian Shurong must be able to act as a man

2301
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:17,900
successfully retired

2302
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:18,900
get retired seam

2303
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:21,500
And then have a good time with his wife

2304
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:26,300
For the rest of his life, he must forget his true colors

2305
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:28,700
How can I forget my true colors

2306
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:31,000
One of the necessary conditions

2307
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:37,800
That is, he must be able to successfully simulate the relationship between men and women

2308
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:39,300
what about this time

2309
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:46,800
Female writers will have a lot of imagination and expression of this kind of love language

2310
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,200
that is to say

2311
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:51,100
Although the matter of dressing up as a man

2312
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:52,500
he's not though

2313
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:54,300
It's about dressing up as a man.

2314
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:58,900
Definitely not something you just do when you get out of the house

2315
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,520
If you think about it, if I decide today

2316
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:04,840
I'm Meng Lijun, I'm going to dress up as a man

2317
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:08,400
I can't wear a dress and put on lipstick at home

2318
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:11,560
When I went out, I hurriedly changed into men's clothes

2319
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:15,400
Put on the boots, no, that wouldn't be a successful drag

2320
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:18,160
I have to put myself through and through

2321
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:21,000
reinvented as a male

2322
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:26,640
From dress up to speech to behavior and even love language

2323
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:29,360
have to be male

2324
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:31,800
this costume will be successful

2325
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:35,840
But if he succeeds, is it still a disguise?

2326
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:39,360
We can see the imagination of a woman disguised as a man

2327
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:42,680
how many layers of complexity

2328
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:46,400
He's about what's called humanity, what's called gender

2329
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:52,120
Identity, the nature of gender, erotic relationships, etc.

2330
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:55,720
Some of these introspections are ours until today

2331
01:50:55,720 --> 01:51:00,040
I'm afraid they're all still tangled up with complex issues

2332
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,400
i am a greedy person

2333
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,200
So I always hope that in a speech

2334
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:08,200
Try to share as much as possible with my audience

2335
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:10,200
so please give me two more minutes

2336
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:16,600
This is also a work from the late 19th century.

2337
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:19,100
It is a post-Taiping work

2338
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:21,600
This work is called Zi Xu Ji

2339
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:24,200
The title of this work gives us a very...

2340
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:26,800
how to say?

2341
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,000
This is very hypocritical, isn't it?

2342
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,400
It's all just imagination, don't take it seriously

2343
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:33,400
But what?

2344
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:38,000
This novel also resolutely demonstrates

2345
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,400
the female writer

2346
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:44,400
He wants to imagine a story about a woman who refuses to look back

2347
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,800
This is a manuscript written by Zixu

2348
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:49,200
Well, Zixu Ji actually has a quite moving story.

2349
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:52,600
This is Wang Ou rewarding him after writing Zixu Ji

2350
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:55,600
This manuscript was inherited by his daughter

2351
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:57,300
Then after the daughter inherits

2352
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:00,300
When I brought it to my husband's house, his husband's...

2353
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,040
Women's Literature is Herself

2354
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:03,120
then her daughter

2355
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:04,280
her daughter's daughter

2356
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:05,760
female inheritance

2357
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:09,720
So she's totally an heir to a woman

2358
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:12,240
She and everything else have male inheritance

2359
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:13,360
are different

2360
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:15,480
then the impressive thing is

2361
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:18,120
This thing has been around since the 1860s

2362
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:20,480
passed the test of time

2363
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:24,440
During the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s

2364
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:25,960
women in this house

2365
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:27,760
descendants of this author

2366
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:29,840
are risking their lives

2367
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,680
to protect the high book

2368
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:33,560
they didn't give it up

2369
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:35,680
You have to imagine something like this

2370
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:38,240
If it was discovered at the time

2371
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:41,400
what a disaster it could be to that family

2372
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:45,120
But this family has worked hard to preserve this high capital.

2373
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:46,680
Then probably a few years ago

2374
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:49,760
donate money to this

2375
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,880
Probably to the local provincial or municipal government or something

2376
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:57,520
So behind this story is actually

2377
01:52:57,520 --> 01:52:59,400
The story behind the preservation of this text

2378
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:00,080
Actually it is

2379
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,620
Just witnessed a talk about this novel

2380
01:53:02,620 --> 01:53:06,580
How it's possible to be a soul treasure passed down from generation to generation by women

2381
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:09,080
such a background

2382
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:09,780
good

2383
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:12,260
sorry i didn't write it down

2384
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:13,600
Okay, it's okay, I read it well again

2385
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:15,620
So what's in this subtitle?

2386
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:18,620
his heroine begins by saying

2387
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:21,000
I want red bayberry to be a man

2388
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:27,460
And I'm definitely not going back as a woman

2389
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:29,460
If one day I'm exposed

2390
01:53:29,460 --> 01:53:31,080
i will die

2391
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:32,420
so in this story

2392
01:53:32,420 --> 01:53:33,920
What about the heroine?

2393
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:34,660
in the end

2394
01:53:34,660 --> 01:53:36,920
he died

2395
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:42,580
He absolutely refuses to follow the norms of society.

2396
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:43,680
So we can probably see

2397
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:48,180
This Zixuji is similar to the era of Jin Yuyuan just now

2398
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:53,340
They all manifested a new, absolute will

2399
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:55,780
The will to break social norms

2400
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:56,300
But what?

2401
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:59,260
They imagined the consequences differently

2402
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:00,260
Jin Yuyuan's practice

2403
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,760
More optimistic, he imagined a successful companion

2404
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:06,880
And the author of this memoir

2405
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:10,680
imagined a woman

2406
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:13,080
the pursuit of this life

2407
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:17,120
In the end there will be no way to resist the system

2408
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:21,520
But you must use your own life to live and die

2409
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:23,400
such a design

2410
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:25,040
So this one is from the 1860s onwards

2411
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,040
two different reactions

2412
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:28,880
Well, finally, it's time to come to the conclusion.

2413
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:31,320
So soon I will share with you a little

2414
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:32,720
I am about female elastic magnetic novel

2415
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:35,720
Some understanding of this creative form

2416
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:37,840
The first one is the female elastic magnetic novel

2417
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:39,640
it's very autobiographical

2418
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:40,720
because these women writers

2419
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:42,200
they are holding

2420
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:46,120
Refusing to let myself follow the disillusionment of the flesh

2421
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:49,400
creative consciousness

2422
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:52,040
They hope that they can achieve immortality

2423
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:53,760
So this creative consciousness

2424
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:57,000
will keep them in their texts

2425
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
to show yourself

2426
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,740
These little books, although they imagined a lot of strange stories about relatives

2427
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:08,260
But it will also write a lot of daily life related to women

2428
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:10,820
For example, eating, for example, giving gifts

2429
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:12,740
For example, production, etc.

2430
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:15,460
So many women's unique experiences

2431
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:20,460
The third one is like Li Qingzhao, who doesn’t just write about personal emotions

2432
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:22,060
Also write the same as the master of the country

2433
01:55:22,060 --> 01:55:28,260
What about these female authors, they don’t just write about the emotions in this regulation

2434
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:33,340
They will put their novels in a big historical framework

2435
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:39,140
They like to think of writing novels as writing history.

2436
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:41,740
is a reflection on history

2437
01:55:41,740 --> 01:55:44,260
Well even we didn't have that example today

2438
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:49,020
But there are some novels, it's just that I want to rewrite the famous history

2439
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:51,820
Such a will is writing

2440
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:53,820
So what next we can see

2441
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:55,780
From the example of Liu Huameng just now

2442
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:58,140
We can see that this female writer

2443
01:55:58,140 --> 01:56:00,140
talk about this novel

2444
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,720
It is said that this relatively flexible genre expresses very strongly

2445
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:05,880
But in the genre of poetry

2446
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:08,200
feelings that cannot be expressed

2447
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:10,000
same-sex love

2448
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,360
So in the end we

2449
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:13,360
In the end, it's actually a question

2450
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:16,040
That is, from these many works

2451
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:18,760
we can really explore

2452
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:19,840
these women writers

2453
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,480
social norms

2454
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:23,480
relationship with the so-called system

2455
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:24,680
Of course they resist

2456
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:26,200
Of course they are counterbalanced

2457
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:28,920
But they often have to be dewormed too

2458
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:31,800
So in the twentieth or twenty-first century

2459
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:33,960
when we re-read these novels

2460
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:36,680
Never simply

2461
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:38,360
is this feminism

2462
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:40,200
or is it a revolution

2463
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:41,640
Is this a gender revolution

2464
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:43,680
such a single thought

2465
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:45,760
look at these works

2466
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,920
ok let's skip this

2467
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:53,040
Finally, as a New Year's gift for everyone today

2468
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:54,920
I want everyone to appreciate

2469
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:56,800
two minutes this is contemporary

2470
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:59,000
very famous

2471
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,440
Real erotic fisting of an actress

2472
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:06,520
Ms. Sheng Xiaojun's performance

2473
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:08,360
This is Mulan Ci

2474
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:09,720
everyone will recite

2475
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:11,360
Let's see Mulan Ci

2476
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:14,720
If you use Peng Xi to perform

2477
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:15,800
what is called

2478
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:13,660
and look at the age is you not the day

2479
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:35,560
Thank you very much Chief Hu for his speech today

2480
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:43,360
I believe you enjoyed an evening of literary fiction sounds as much as I did

2481
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:45,600
Not only he is greedy, but I am also greedy

2482
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:47,260
I've been wanting to hear it all

2483
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:49,960
Based on my usual experience in hosting meetings

2484
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:52,360
I interrupted him about half an hour ago.

2485
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:54,640
I can't bear to interrupt him today.

2486
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:59,000
Especially for me, someone with a background in science, engineering and mathematics

2487
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,600
This opportunity to enjoy the voice of this spa novel

2488
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:07,120
So sorry and don't really have much time

2489
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:10,480
Let me ask you this question

2490
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:14,520
I think unless you are very interested in this stuff

2491
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:17,560
I guess just open up a question or two

2492
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:19,000
ok please

2493
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,920
ask the professor

2494
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:23,520
the one just mentioned

2495
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:26,920
That is to say, a woman disguised as a man became a high official

2496
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:31,120
So during tutoring, will you commit the crime of the Seventh Army?

2497
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:33,400
Yes Nadine Minger asks you

2498
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:37,160
That is to say, these protagonists, they all

2499
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:40,440
I want to make myself a boy

2500
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:41,120
right

2501
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:44,800
Then I was wondering if they were modern people

2502
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:47,440
then they should be

2503
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:51,000
like we are very transgender now

2504
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:51,680
right

2505
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:53,960
the rule is

2506
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:57,520
And the same-sex business, right?

2507
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:58,280
Thanks

2508
02:00:58,280 --> 02:00:59,400
thanks for your question

2509
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:00,000
yes

2510
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,500
Disguising a woman as a man is called reversing yin and yang, which is a crime of deceiving the emperor

2511
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:05,960
His crime is not just because of bullying the king

2512
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:11,460
At the same time, it is also because he disturbed the order of heaven and earth

2513
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:12,960
so it's really a felony

2514
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,260
It is precisely because of this

2515
02:01:14,260 --> 02:01:18,340
So the heroine in this novel

2516
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:20,960
They will all be under a lot of pressure

2517
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:22,720
Like why in the story of Meng Lijun

2518
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:24,300
the emperor can oppress him saying

2519
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:27,960
Come on and develop this affair with me a little bit

2520
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:30,500
Just because the emperor can grab him by the throat

2521
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:30,920
right

2522
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:32,100
I just want to expose you

2523
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:32,920
you are capital crime

2524
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:33,800
I can't spare you

2525
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:35,160
So in that story is

2526
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:37,960
The queen mother came forward and said to forgive him.

2527
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:40,080
So so indeed this is a key point

2528
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:42,880
All this related text inside

2529
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:45,080
will ponder over this issue.

2530
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:47,620
Each author has his own interpretation

2531
02:01:47,620 --> 02:01:49,280
like the one we just saw

2532
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:51,240
The story of the former Shurong

2533
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:52,040
he is not

2534
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:52,960
Instead of Qian Shurong

2535
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:55,160
another one

2536
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:56,380
The story of Zixu

2537
02:01:56,380 --> 02:01:57,640
won't he die

2538
02:01:57,720 --> 02:01:58,680
it's me who dies

2539
02:01:58,680 --> 02:01:59,240
good

2540
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:00,000
then as for

2541
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Yun’s second question just now is about their

2542
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Are we going to treat them as transgender in modern times?

2543
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Or maybe this can't be called a transsexual?

2544
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
what is it called

2545
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
not just gay

2546
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:16,000
should have a proper name

2547
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
I dare not now

2548
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
A question of gender identity

2549
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,000
it's a very complex question

2550
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,000
It is also different in each text

2551
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,000
I personally feel like Liu Huameng

2552
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:33,000
or a goldfish garden

2553
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:36,000
author of goldfish garden

2554
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Exhibits very strong celibacy

2555
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,000
the need not to marry

2556
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:46,000
But what about his celibacy

2557
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Does it have anything to do with his gender identity?

2558
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:52,000
It's more ambiguous, not so clear

2559
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
We can see that he certainly describes

2560
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
His so-called wife who is also female

2561
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,000
this is living a good married life

2562
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
but in the novel

2563
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
you don't feel very

2564
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,000
strong desire

2565
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Lust Carnal desire Rarely

2566
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,000
But Liu Huameng's work is different

2567
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
I think Liu Huameng's work

2568
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
what is conveyed in

2569
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,000
this homosexual

2570
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,000
intensity depth etc.

2571
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
cannot be ignored

2572
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
That is to say, we can't simply say

2573
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
This is the intimacy between girls

2574
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Are you afraid of handing in? What? No.

2575
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
if we face it honestly

2576
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
words in that text

2577
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
we will know

2578
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
that is gay

2579
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
But does that mean

2580
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
He has a problem with his gender identity

2581
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
i think that's something else

2582
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
because homosexuality does not mean

2583
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
His gender identity is different

2584
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
right?

2585
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
So I think that should be discussed separately

2586
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
But in these works

2587
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
is there any author

2588
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:00,000
The writer moved to modern times alone

2589
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,460
He'll say I'm going transgender

2590
02:04:01,460 --> 02:04:03,300
I dare not say I think it is possible

2591
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:06,700
But I can't see it from the text

2592
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:08,900
very clear evidence

2593
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:13,000
Well, I think because of time

2594
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,500
we probably can't help it

2595
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:17,300
Today I am really grateful to Chief Hu

2596
02:04:17,300 --> 02:04:19,500
his greedy novel

2597
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:22,200
Not his deep interpretation

2598
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:23,500
we probably don't understand

2599
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:27,000
I think I probably know and understand a little

2600
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:31,700
Maybe the women here can understand more deeply

2601
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:35,700
At least knowing I can have something to watch when I retire

2602
02:04:35,700 --> 02:04:38,200
Thank you again Chief Hu Thank you
