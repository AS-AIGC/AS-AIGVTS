1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Academia Sinica

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Academia Sinica 11 six copies

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Machine Feast Lecture Begins

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We ask Vice President Chen Jianren to host for us

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Director Liu Hudong

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And some of our academicians here

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and ladies and gentlemen

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
good night everyone

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
today we are very happy

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This knowledge feast of our Academia Sinica

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I can invite Director Liu Hudong

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Come talk to us about the topic

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,800
speech

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,160
So today is our admission to the Central South Hospital

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,120
This knowledge misses the record

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,960
one day

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,480
Because we have more than 300 applicants today

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,720
Then more than 100 colleagues from our hospital participated

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,240
Then there are 200 people outside the hospital

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,720
So wait a minute for those who are too late to come in

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,480
There are other lecture halls where you can listen to lectures

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,720
So say we

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,720
Director Liu is very attractive

24
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,920
first of all, let's keep it simple

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,960
introduce

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,080
Director Liu Budong

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,920
Liu Yanshi's qualifications

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,240
Academician Liu Budong

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,200
He graduated from the Chemistry Department of National Taiwan University in 1970

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,000
Made in the United States in 1976

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,960
Ph.D. in Chemistry, University of Chicago

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,120
He then served

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,120
Postdoctoral Researcher in Chemistry and Immunology

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,760
Then go to the famous Scripps in the United States

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,080
Research center

36
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,320
serve

37
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,120
La Jolla Medical Research Institute

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,120
research work

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,720
That's rare

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,440
ah

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,040
this one at the time

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,520
Dr. Liu is our present Liu Yansi

43
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,900
also during this period

44
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,640
He once studied at McAnney University in the United States

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,720
This one achieved an MD

46
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,320
UCSD

47
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,560
Receive specialist training in dermatology

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,400
So he went from chemistry to medical dermatology

49
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,560
Then he was at this Scripps research center

50
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,640
Bannon Associate Professor and Director, Department of Allergy Research

51
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,040
Then at the Allergy-Level Academy of Fine Arts in La Jolla

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,360
Professor and Director of the Department of Allergy

53
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,800
In 2001, he was in the Daishi School in California, USA

54
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,320
Professor and Director of Dermatology

55
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,080
2011 as

56
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,520
This particular professor at U.C. Davis

57
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,720
And is now an honorary professor at U.C. Davis

58
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,160
The reason is because we are lucky

59
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,800
Academia Sinica in 2011

60
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,640
Can invite our director Liu Fudong

61
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,760
Mr. Liu

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,400
Return to China to serve as the director of our biomedical institute

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,840
I am a specific researcher

64
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,640
We also congratulate Director Yuan

65
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,120
This year he was elected as an academician of Academia Sinica

66
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,480
actually

67
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,200
Director Yuan's research on allergy

68
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,160
Already well-known internationally

69
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,840
and made a lot of contributions

70
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,680
For example, he has developed

71
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,960
can continuously separate IgE

72
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,360
is one per globulin

73
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,520
At the beginning, I looked at the fusion game package strain

74
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,800
it's quite outstanding

75
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,920
in addition

76
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,000
Director Yuan is studying the coagulation number of galactose

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,760
you can listen to this part

78
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,960
also feet

79
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,600
also sour

80
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,960
After he returns to our Academia Sinica

81
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,200
Already with our biomedical institute

82
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,120
and his colleagues in the Central Research Area

83
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,400
promoted many large-scale studies together

84
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
including the relationship between gardens and disease

85
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,880
That's today's topic

86
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,600
There is also the part of Tang's biomedicine

87
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,080
Director Yuan is also presiding over Taiwan's

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,500
Establishment of Biobank

89
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,000
with a very important impetus

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Taiwan Biomedical Research

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,500
and a job in the development of the biomedical industry

92
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,000
That amount of shortening has served as a journal that is well-known abroad

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The Journal of Clinical Investigation

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,500
Associate Editor, Jonathan Crane Co. Investigation

95
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,500
And now it's famous

96
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,000
The Journal of Dermatology

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Editor-in-Chief of Jonathan Taurogyk's Science

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,500
Of course Academician Liu has won numerous awards

99
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,000
which also includes this

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
University of California

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
John O. M. Tinger Memorial Award

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,500
He gave a cancer and lung disease research

103
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,000
this award

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And it is our Taiwan dermatology department

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,500
A very important award from the Society of Dermatology

106
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,000
Professor Li Yaoqing's Memorial Award

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,500
Also an honorary member of our Taiwan Dermatology Association

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,100
Today we are very happy to invite Chief Luo to talk to us about

109
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,900
Today's keynote address Response and Disease

110
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,500
Is he our enemy or our friend

111
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,540
a relationship

112
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,080
that was a great speech

113
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,880
let us all applaud him

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,560
Thank you, Dean Shengfu, for your introduction

115
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,140
Thank you everyone, it's raining today

116
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,700
listen to the speech here

117
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,520
I am very very happy to have this opportunity

118
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,300
share with you

119
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,120
My response to this inflammatory response and disease

120
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,920
some understanding of the relationship

121
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,740
I'm doing research

122
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,540
Just now Dean Shengfu also mentioned that it is immune

123
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,860
Also very interested in the response to the speech

124
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,460
In this regard, professional speeches have given

125
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,780
Quite many times, but the words of popular science is the first time

126
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,900
Then I know I saw the statistics of this registration

127
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Many of them are business related

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,840
I hope I'm not overly simplistic.

129
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,800
that's not for that

130
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,400
It's also a stranger

131
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,500
That hopefully speaking can be understood

132
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
then some gain

133
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
the word that speaks

134
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,800
In fact, it has been known for two thousand years

135
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,500
That's when you speak

136
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,900
it's a latin word called

137
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,900
set to fire is to set fire to burn

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Then this is the word inflame

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,600
In fact, almost a century ago

140
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,000
almost 150 years ago

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,400
Only then did the concept of that cell come in

142
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
put in this speech response

143
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,900
Then you know how to speak and respond

144
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,000
Probably how to continue to start some

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,900
Some of that new development understands

146
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,400
but so of course

147
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,500
So this statement response is not an update

148
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,400
But what about the disease?

149
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,700
is relatively new

150
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,400
It's something that happened in the last twenty or thirty years

151
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,500
found that many diseases

152
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,000
can be explained by speech

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,820
The disease used to be thought to be caused by something other than inflammation

154
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,380
Does the inflammation have something to do with the inflammation now?

155
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,700
So today I will focus on the topic of inflammation.

156
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,500
with disease

157
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,100
The first one to use this is a simple 30-second cartoon

158
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,920
It's from Google

159
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,300
That's what I think is inflammation towards this polarity

160
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:33,280
I think it is a very simple and clear explanation

161
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,840
Then you see this is a capillary

162
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,140
and then there is that blood

163
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,700
It's the red iron ball that will flow through

164
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,500
sometimes white blood cells

165
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,320
And then you'll find bacteria coming in

166
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,600
It's like a skin

167
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,160
After bacteria enter under the skin

168
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,300
The bacteria also signal to make the microvascular cells

169
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,120
This time it is closed cells

170
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,140
it will react

171
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,160
then here

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,500
Substances in the blood come out

173
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:13,200
Then the next step is to let the blood vessels

174
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,500
The other information is that its white blood cells will come out

175
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,600
Well, those are red blood cells, you can see that

176
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,000
Here comes the bacteria

177
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,600
Then it emits some signal

178
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,800
The signal that the blood vessel knows will make some changes in the future

179
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,100
Then here, some of its blood vessels

180
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,100
Some liquid still escapes

181
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,800
What about some substances in these bands?

182
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,200
Combined with that bacteria

183
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,400
generate some more signals

184
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,600
Then this one will come out

185
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,100
it starts eating the cells

186
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,800
And the bacteria is clear here

187
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,000
That's the acute origin reaction.

188
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,000
So the definition of origin reaction

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That is to say, the biological tissue is traumatized, internally injured

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,440
or patient infection

191
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,640
Like just now, it was an example of a patient being infected

192
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,480
or reaction to exposure to irritating substances

193
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,200
Then its tissue response is to include the red

194
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,040
Fever Pain Symptoms

195
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,000
The reason for the redness is that the microvessels will expand

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,800
Then the blood is more expensive

197
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,600
That's because blood is red

198
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,000
so it will have shallots

199
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,200
The tissue color of that part compares with red

200
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,280
In general, it is because the substances in the blood will escape from what I just said.

201
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
If you have a fever, it is also related to blood circulation.

202
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,360
it's ours

203
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,880
cold body temperature

204
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:48,160
It spreads into the so-called injured tissue

205
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,880
If there is pain, it is after these substances come out

206
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,640
it affects the nerve endings

207
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,600
So in this following speech

208
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,040
I'll talk about it first

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,800
It is the relationship between avoiding the source and the inflammatory response

210
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,900
then talk about trauma

211
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,900
Then talk about some irritating substances

212
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,600
Then talk about internal injuries

213
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,100
but some

214
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,000
For example, related to the heart

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,100
related to angels

216
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,600
so high cool range

217
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
is brutal

218
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
our human body

219
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,300
not actually a human body

220
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,300
Even the D-Dent animals are the same

221
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,200
just have this kind of resistance

222
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
A mechanism of Defense

223
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,100
like our country

224
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,200
If there are foreign enemies

225
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
we will know how to resist

226
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This is the mechanism of resistance

227
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,600
depends on some immune system

228
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,500
So the immune response is closely related to the inflammatory response

229
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,200
There are two immune responses

230
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,900
an innate immune system

231
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,200
One is a response called adaptation

232
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,700
Let me not mention it for now

233
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,000
innate immune words

234
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The two protagonists are Nutriphil and Microphage

235
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,900
This is the missing white blood cell

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,140
Megalithic cells

237
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,520
The missing white snowball

238
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
in the blood

239
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,440
You just saw that cartoon

240
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,560
That is the missing white snowball coming out

241
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,160
it's in the blood

242
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,400
Of course, red blood cells are the most

243
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,000
But the most white blood cells are

244
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,080
It is Nilchffville

245
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,360
missing white snowball

246
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,040
It is about one and a half times the size of a red blood cell

247
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,000
it is a microscope image

248
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,920
If after dyeing

249
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,000
You can see it has

250
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,080
it has several nuclei

251
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,840
About five slices of three slices

252
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,280
why is it called neutral

253
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,520
That's because when dyed

254
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,480
Some cells are stained to become stained

255
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,680
some cells turn red

256
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,400
That is, Basophil has Synophil

257
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,560
Then this is without Balve

258
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
no no no no dyeing

259
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,480
not red

260
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,320
it is equal to say neutral color

261
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,640
So it's called Nilchffville

262
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,120
Then it was shown in the cartoon just now

263
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,680
It's Nilchffville that circulates in the blood

264
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,040
Then when you get this signal

265
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,800
It will leave the tissue from the blood circulation to dels

266
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,600
At this time, there is a factor called driving factor

267
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Chimokai

268
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,100
It is very important in this inflammatory response

269
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,400
So I'm researching and researching addicts in this research

270
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,900
It will mention several cells

271
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,200
most important

272
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,900
a few cells

273
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,600
several molecules

274
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,300
Molecule is an important thing called Chimokai

275
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,300
So the driving factor

276
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,900
No need to know the details

277
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,500
But I know that this protein

278
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,200
because of its relationship

279
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,800
Where will this white blood cell come out?

280
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,900
know where to go

281
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,600
then it just

282
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
it's to this germy place

283
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,100
Then it will put the germ

284
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,500
or swallow it

285
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,700
or put it

286
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,200
kill that

287
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,800
or it sucks it

288
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,900
there is a way

289
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,800
But its end result is that it will

290
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,000
it is against the germ

291
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,400
And finally eliminate the germs

292
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,500
so this is

293
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,100
This is a

294
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
in the inflammatory response

295
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,440
A very important cell is New Nufel

296
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,000
This V6 is quite interesting

297
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
quite famous now

298
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
This is Snowball

299
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,500
This is the red snowball

300
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,240
There's a New Nufel in here

301
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,500
those are bacteria

302
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Then he will know where the germs are

303
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,800
He has been checking this bacteria

304
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
and finally swallow it

305
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,000
that is not yet

306
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
right

307
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
slowly

308
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And now he finally got this bacterium in

309
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
exists inside

310
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Then he found another

311
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Seems to be bigger bacteria

312
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
he used to devour it

313
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
so this is

314
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That is, he has this real function

315
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's the first protagonist

316
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The second protagonist is the microphage

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
megalithic cells

318
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
so is this

319
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It will eat the source of the disease

320
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and after eating

321
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Same with Newfel in the world

322
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I didn't say it just now

323
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
it has a

324
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
There are some called dragon body

325
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It will finally eat the source of the disease

326
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
break it down

327
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
products of decomposition it will come out

328
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So in terms of this role of resisting the patient

329
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Neutral field is similar to migrophox

330
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
it can eat it too

331
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It can also secrete some substances

332
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
kill these bacteria

333
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
there is a difference

334
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
wait a minute i'll talk more

335
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But the difference is that it

336
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Because after this decomposition

337
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
it is carried out in detail

338
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't think so

339
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But in the end it was able to make that

340
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I just mentioned that there is innate immunity

341
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Immunity to the adaptive response

342
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
it will make that adaptive response

343
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
immune response will come out

344
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
wait a minute

345
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
basically

346
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
These are the two neutral fields

347
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
with migrophox

348
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
They are the two protagonists doing the inflammatory response

349
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So here the words

350
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It is said that the inflammatory reaction is the enemy or there is

351
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's obvious here

352
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Because if you don't have these inflammatory reactions

353
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Without this neutrophil, without microphage

354
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
If there is a bacterial infection, there is no way to resist it.

355
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So this is an indispensable resistance mechanism of the human body

356
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Then this resistance mechanism reflects an inflammatory response

357
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Another source of disease is the virus

358
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Viruses are slightly different

359
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The virus is when the human body knows that there is a virus infection

360
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It has a polar cell

361
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
wait a minute i'll talk more

362
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So let's not talk about the polar cells for now.

363
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
it makes two lymphocytes

364
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
One for T cells and one for B cell activation

365
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
T cells then produce some cytokines

366
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I just talked about I just talked about a few cells

367
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and then several substances

368
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,400
I just said that KIMOKAI is called the driving factor

369
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,840
Cytokines

370
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,660
These two are the most important two in the inflammatory response

371
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,540
two ophthalmia

372
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,440
cytokines and cytokines

373
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,320
One is KIMOKAI and the other is cellular liver

374
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,080
additionally activated cells

375
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,700
T cells produce cytokines

376
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,540
In addition, it knows when there is a virus infection

377
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,160
it becomes a cell body

378
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,160
it kills other cells

379
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Viruses usually go inside cells

380
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
survive there

381
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
it can breed here

382
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
then there came out

383
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
This cell will know to say

384
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,160
where is this virus

385
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,160
Then it poisons the cell

386
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,160
virus infected cells

387
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,160
So use this way to fight this virus

388
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Another way is to use B cells

389
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,160
B cells produce body

390
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,200
can synthesize virus

391
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,400
So just said three

392
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,200
One is Neutral Fuel and Magavage

393
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,600
Two to fight the pathogen

394
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,900
The other is to use 08 ball

395
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,600
08 cells to fight the virus

396
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,900
These are also immune responses

397
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,600
But it is also possible to produce

398
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,800
A basic process of the inflammatory response

399
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,400
good

400
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,700
That's what I just said

401
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,000
It's the inflammatory response that we have

402
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,300
we can't do without these

403
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,100
inflammatory response cells

404
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,800
or these bases

405
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,000
Or that Kimokansalokan

406
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,500
Then I believe in the following one

407
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,800
I think it's a very good example of an inflammatory response.

408
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,600
That is Injury Repair

409
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
That's after the wound

410
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,600
how do we get it back

411
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,500
That's because I'm a dermatologist

412
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,400
so i believe

413
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,760
The example I chose is also related to the skin

414
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,240
more familiar

415
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,840
So the mechanism of wound repair

416
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,600
Generally speaking

417
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
after being injured

418
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,000
It can be roughly divided into three stages

419
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,640
let the wound heal

420
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,400
The first stage is Information

421
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,320
so when you get hurt

422
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,040
Of course we know that said wounds have wounds

423
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,560
But the first reaction is the inflammatory reaction

424
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,840
is an inflammatory reaction

425
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,440
This is a local inflammatory reaction

426
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,680
I'll talk about the details later

427
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,480
This is on the first day and the second day

428
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,360
is a local inflammatory reaction

429
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,720
Then there will be a process of cell proliferation

430
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
Then finally the wound presynthesis matures

431
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,600
This is about a week or so

432
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
A week or two here

433
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
But in fact it sometimes

434
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,040
If the wound is large, it can be repaired in it for a year.

435
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,840
and then again and again

436
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,640
let it finally mature

437
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,680
so here

438
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,000
The first is if

439
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,880
here is a skin

440
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,560
got hurt

441
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,320
so hurt

442
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
Of course the first feeling is

443
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So it should be seen that there is a suspension of school

444
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Next, when I study abroad in human body

445
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The school version will come

446
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
After the school version came in

447
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Let's learn from the adjacent bone

448
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So that's our body's first reaction

449
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
This is not an inflammatory reaction

450
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But in fact the school version will also

451
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
also co-builds the inflammatory response

452
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I won't mention it anymore

453
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Those two are the students of the school version

454
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I won't mention it anymore

455
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
what's next

456
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That means there are germs coming in.

457
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Then you might say

458
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I actually wash my hands

459
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Although after the cut

460
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
There should be no virus

461
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
but it's really amazing

462
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
is our human body

463
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
you don't know

464
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But let's say that the skin is not above

465
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
There are thousands of diseases

466
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
the bacteria is on it

467
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
is quite okay with us

468
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
we don't interfere with them

469
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
they don't bother us

470
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
commercial bacteria

471
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,500
it doesn't infect us

472
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
it's over there

473
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,500
We correspond to co-existence

474
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Usually we don't even know

475
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,000
but when hurt

476
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
These germs will enter the human body

477
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
At this time we will react

478
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
just like our first cartoon

479
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
After some bacteria come in

480
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,500
White blood cells know how to kill the germs

481
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
So it's the same here

482
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:37,000
Invading germs attract white blood cells

483
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
white blood cells first neutrophils

484
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It is neutrophil

485
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So this is the first day

486
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's neutrophil coming

487
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
These neutrophils begin to clear these bacteria

488
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You see less and less bacteria

489
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
mid term

490
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,500
It's called monocytes coming in here

491
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,000
Then it becomes true after monocyte activation

492
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,120
megalithic cells

493
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,720
This is MACOFIG

494
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,680
Its predecessor is the monocyte

495
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,720
called MALASIDE

496
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,200
And then it can also help the gluteal stone invade the bacteria

497
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,320
and dead tissue and blood cells

498
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,520
That's monocytes

499
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,160
So in a few days or so

500
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,840
monocytes come in

501
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,640
It then activates into a megalithic cell

502
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,960
Here MACOFIG

503
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,720
Then it goes on NUGIFILM

504
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,000
unfinished work

505
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,960
And NUGIFILM died too

506
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,240
it can swallow it up

507
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,160
I'll talk to you next time

508
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,240
not that relevant

509
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,600
it always pre-cores

510
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,720
Pre-core is to fill in the missing tissue

511
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,000
and pull into the sides of the wound

512
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,080
Tissue that helps prenucleate to form eight scars

513
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,400
That's where the words are keratinocytes

514
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,160
It still needs to be repaired here

515
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,560
At this time, fibroblasts

516
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,880
FIREBLAZE plays an important role

517
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,120
it secretes

518
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,400
collagen , fibroelastin

519
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,760
These words are here

520
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,860
The wound can close him

521
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,820
In other words, toe cells

522
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,600
This wound must also be pre-closed

523
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,660
he moves and proliferates

524
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,700
Then here, the wound gets smaller and smaller

525
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,960
In the end, it couldn't be seen that there was a wound

526
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,980
so this is

527
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,200
In the end, the sawtooth cell will still be here

528
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,360
haven't left yet

529
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,340
He continues to put some

530
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,740
dead cells, debris

531
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,300
and some excess scar tissue

532
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,380
fix it again

533
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,580
It's like doing clean up work here

534
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,220
so this is a

535
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,580
just a really good one

536
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,140
example of an inflammatory response

537
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,580
So this is also, we say that the inflammatory reaction is in it

538
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,300
are we have or low

539
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,460
should be there

540
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,460
Because if there is no inflammatory response,

541
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,460
The wound is not big

542
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So it is a wound that needs to be pre-nucleated, starting with the inflammatory response

543
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That's why there is this step by step like this

544
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
to the final pre-core

545
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But if there is no word in the previous paragraph

546
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It is more difficult to pre-nucleate the wound if it is inflamed.

547
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But the mechanism of this immunity

548
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Inflammation mechanisms also take a toll

549
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That's because it's hard to say how much is enough, right?

550
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's what we know we must have an inflammatory response

551
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
To be able to resist the virus from outside

552
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Pre-nucleation requires an inflammatory response

553
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But it's really hard to know how much is enough

554
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
that's not perfect

555
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So I now have an example

556
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It is when the inflammatory response should have helped the host

557
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Then for example in the case of inflammation in the case of infection

558
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
but it's a little too much

559
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So the result it gets is a problem for the human body

560
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,200
On the contrary, there is a great threat

561
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,600
that's what i think you should remember

562
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,500
10 years ago 10 years ago

563
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,300
SARS affected us a lot

564
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,100
2002 to 2003

565
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,100
In Asia, there are probably tens of thousands of this

566
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,800
People are affected

567
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,600
The number of people with 100,000 is also nearly 1,000

568
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,200
The damage to the economy is about 40 billion US dollars.

569
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
This is a

570
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,400
When I found this effect

571
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,900
What caused SARS was a virus

572
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,200
Its name is the filling virus

573
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Because you can see this under a microscope

574
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,500
Some prominent structures like Huangguan Zhouyuan

575
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,000
That's why it's called a filling virus

576
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,200
Then this was the serious infection caused by Taiwan

577
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,000
Many hospitals closed their eyes

578
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,100
many people wearing masks

579
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,900
Then this is the sanitation of front and rear recognition

580
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,020
The chief goes to the Peace Hospital

581
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,220
they dress inclusive

582
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,420
Airtight clothes to the hospital to see

583
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,500
This is the original case

584
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,120
About 600 to 700 people were affected

585
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:21,760
About 15% should be dead

586
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,560
So everyone should have

587
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,820
The number of frontlines is unknown

588
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:33,320
But there are about 300 deaths

589
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,860
same as marching flu

590
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,400
just have a fever and dizziness

591
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,460
temper oxygen headache

592
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,280
muscular mature

593
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,760
throat cough etc.

594
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,560
But it's most important

595
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,960
After it is infected by the virus

596
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,560
it affects the lungs

597
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,920
then pneumonia

598
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,820
when taking x-rays

599
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,120
It doesn't look like the pneumonia is very serious

600
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Some patients need a respirator to help keep him alive

601
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Then about 10 to 15% of the cases are infected and he will not survive

602
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Then this is the inflammatory response of the human body to the infection of this virus

603
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And this inflammatory response is too strong

604
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Therefore, it is called Sidokan stone at this time

605
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It's a storm of cytokines

606
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I just mentioned cytokines and this Hemokan

607
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
is very important and plays an important role in the inflammatory response

608
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But if he says it's too much

609
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It is called Sidokan stone

610
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
In this case

611
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
This is Sidokan's exaggerated immune response

612
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
or an inflammatory response that destroys tissue in the lungs

613
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
The result was severe pneumonia.

614
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,000
In the following words, we will talk about inflammation, infection and wound repair

615
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Saying that he should be indispensable to this

616
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:23,000
But in a way, he was supposed to be helpful against the hospital

617
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
But if he goes too far, it will affect life and be dangerous

618
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I will now give a few other examples

619
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
So it turns out, they're talking about acute inflammatory reactions

620
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Now let's talk about the chronic inflammatory response

621
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Some things we've probably known from the past are inflammatory reactions.

622
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
But I will talk about a few more examples later because I didn’t know about it in the past.

623
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It is said that it is really caused by an inflammatory reaction.

624
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It is now known that the inflammatory response plays an important role

625
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The first is the name

626
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,500
I think what I said earlier was about cell bacterial infection

627
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,000
Then I think everyone in each district has experience with wounds

628
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
If you are allergic, I think it is about ten or twenty percent.

629
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So there will be allergies

630
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
So there are probably a lot of faces when you are doing it.

631
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
is aware of the effects of allergies

632
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
this is an allergic reaction

633
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Then it usually means that there are some substances around us

634
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
should be humilus

635
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But our bodies still respond

636
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
because it is forend

637
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But sometimes the reaction doesn't matter much

638
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But for this kind of humilus

639
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
it produces this reaction

640
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and the result of the reaction is an allergic reaction

641
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
This substance we have to take care of is called allergy

642
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That's like skin contact

643
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It’s Lujiao’s Latex

644
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
or animal hair

645
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,280
Allergic skin reaction after contact with skin

646
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,400
Some medicines in milk and milk can cause allergies

647
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,400
Some of those are just that, for example, peanuts

648
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,200
caused by other lotuses

649
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,120
Also very commonly seen by allergists

650
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,080
I heard recently that it is, for example, a child recently

651
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,600
This kind of allergy to this peanut is more and more

652
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,920
It seems that it may be, for example, an inside

653
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,400
one in five

654
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,920
In fact, this allergy is getting more and more

655
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,560
The reason for that is wait a minute we have a chance

656
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:48,800
Maybe talk a little more about why we have more and more allergies

657
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,360
that anyway

658
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,960
This is what causes allergies when you eat it

659
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,440
Sometimes by injection, medicine or honey

660
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,960
The venom of the honey bee ran into the human body

661
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,000
some people will be reborn

662
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
allergic reaction

663
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
In addition, western words such as pollen

664
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
i think some of you guys

665
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Some of you will know from experience with hay fever

666
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
black pneumonia

667
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That's because there are some proteins in the pollen

668
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
to it will produce

669
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It is some substance that should be homeless

670
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
But after you inhale

671
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
had this allergic reaction

672
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
If the dust is not the dust itself

673
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It's the mite inside the dust, which is full of dust

674
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
also an allergy

675
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
that plum fungus, that has hair

676
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
What about those allergies?

677
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
usually begins in childhood

678
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
There are several different ways of expressing these

679
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
One is private, that is skin

680
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
odorous dermatitis

681
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That's usually odorous dermatitis first.

682
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Then, at the same time

683
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,500
In childhood, for example, at about six months, it can occur at about one to two years old, and the incidence rate is relatively high.

684
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,500
15 Over rice is another, also a kind of allergies

685
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Then there will be wheezing, and finally rhinitis will come out

686
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:23,500
This order is not necessarily like this, but most of them are like this, so this is called allergic march

687
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:30,000
These are all related to an allergic disease

688
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Fortunately, if you are allergic at 15, it usually disappears after a few years

689
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
This treatment will also gradually improve, and the same is true for breathlessness.

690
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Rhinitis will be easier to continue until adulthood

691
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Of course, these all start when you are an adult, and there are also such

692
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Let's talk about allergic reactions

693
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
just mentioned

694
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,220
B is 08 cells, two of them are T and B

695
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,540
Let's talk about B cells first

696
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,940
B cells produce antibodies

697
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:15,220
For example, IGM, IGG, the most IGG, IGA

698
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,240
In addition, the least is IGE

699
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,820
This IGE produced an over-reaction, the most important role

700
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,320
IGE antibody

701
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,840
IGE has a special feature, it is another cell

702
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,240
It's related to allergic reactions, yes, it's related to anti-antireactions.

703
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,900
And it's very related to allergic reactions, called mast cells

704
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,900
That's called MASO

705
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,960
IGE will have its receptors on this

706
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,900
so it attaches to the mast cells

707
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,760
If this is true, it is wrong, it should be the other way around

708
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
reverse like this

709
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:56,480
It is anti-inflammatory and allergic

710
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Connect to this MASTER

711
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Then the allergic person in

712
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
these are allergies

713
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
allergic person

714
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Then when you see someone with allergies

715
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
He will activate this MASTER

716
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
MASTER will generate

717
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
like organizing MMA

718
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
There are other substances that can be called sensitive

719
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I think everyone has heard of this HISTOMINE

720
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
would be called, say, WT runny nose

721
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
just shed tears

722
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
or red eyes

723
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
These phenomena

724
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
that's sensitive

725
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's a sensitive reaction

726
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
THAT HISTOMINE IS IMPORTANT

727
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
important cause of sensitivity

728
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
that's a little bit deeper

729
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It is how the BBC bag is made to cause IGE

730
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Because it is the control of T cells

731
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So T cells are more commanding

732
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
this cell

733
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It will talk to the BBC package

734
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
You have to develop antibodies

735
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And I first T cells will talk to the BBC package

736
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You have to create antibodies that are IGE

737
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
How do T cells know that there are these fermenter forces?

738
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Another very important cell, this should probably be Commander

739
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It is called looking at the source and presenting cells, that is, Energy Preserving Cells

740
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
The other name is Dendry Cell, which is called polar cells

741
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
The reason for the polar shape is because it is born like a touch shake, called Dendry Cell

742
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
This is a very important cell

743
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Talking about a gap is last year's Nobel Prize

744
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Given to Ross Diamond of Immunology at Rockupill University

745
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It is because it discovered Dendry Cell, so it holds the Nobel Prize

746
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
But sadly, it's also fun

747
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It was actually three days before the price was announced, it was too much

748
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Then this inner guard card is usually not given to the deceased.

749
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It's not the one who lives now that will be given again

750
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
when we were inside

751
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Because everyone knows that he is not in good health

752
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
In fact he is a handicapped cancer

753
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But the committee member of the inner guard

754
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
he is not sure

755
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
don't know his illness

756
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
His hands are already ashamed

757
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
that close

758
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Didn't know he was dead when it was announced

759
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
But he finally decided to give him

760
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Give this award to his kid guest

761
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Although his contribution is very large

762
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Also because he studies this

763
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
This is a very important cell

764
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I just said he gave orders

765
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So it is very important in the immune response

766
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
doing that now

767
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
character award like this

768
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,260
like cancer

769
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,860
but i won't say a word

770
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,060
cancer treatments

771
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,160
One way is to

772
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,600
See how we can use our immune system

773
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,100
look at cancer

774
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,900
that it because

775
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,000
But this becomes a very important type of cell

776
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,100
Then it's because of research on this

777
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,140
So it uses its own cell

778
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,100
to treat my pancreatic cancer

779
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,740
Turns out it actually works for it

780
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,200
So it only gets after pancreatic cancer

781
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,700
it survived for about five or six years

782
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,800
five or six years

783
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,300
just passed away

784
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,600
If it doesn't have this

785
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,900
i don't think it can get it

786
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,600
nobel prize

787
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,300
Because the Nobel Prize is

788
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,100
always have to wait a few years

789
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,400
after knowing its fruit

790
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,600
to give it

791
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,100
But it is a pity that in

792
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,000
three days before the announcement

793
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,800
it passed away

794
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,300
it doesn't know itself

795
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,700
so it got the nobel prize

796
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,700
That's almost

797
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,300
OK, that's strictly normal

798
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,100
it this is a

799
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,300
also a cartoon

800
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,000
it's an allergic reaction

801
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,700
mast cells

802
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,200
it's a mast cell

803
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,960
This is sealed venom, entering this is a Myself

804
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,620
And there's a lot of Grammy that produces Histamine

805
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,900
There's particles over here, this is IgE, this is allergen

806
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,160
After receiving its signal, it will enter

807
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,760
Then these particles with Histamine will be expelled

808
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:24,320
that is an allergic reaction

809
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,600
That is the Histamine tissue plant

810
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,600
But the cartoon is not actually right either

811
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,800
So sometimes you're being a tribute at Google and it's not always completely

812
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,000
is completely convinced that this is true

813
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,900
Because of its Histamine release

814
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:43,100
The cell is alive, it just takes its Histamine out

815
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,700
But the cells still survive

816
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,600
But the change is as if the whole cell becomes scattered

817
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,100
This is actually not true

818
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:59,700
It's related to allergies, it's related to B yuan, it's asthma

819
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,640
Asthma is more serious than

820
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,920
because it is sometimes hard to breathe

821
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,560
This is what it looks like when the trachea is normal

822
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,800
This is the trachea

823
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,720
This is the respiratory tract

824
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,040
when panting

825
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,640
One is why you are short of breath

826
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,080
A big reason is that it has Bronco Contrusion

827
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,360
it's muscle tension

828
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,720
So its trachea constricts

829
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,160
Once it shrinks, it passes through and becomes much smaller

830
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,360
so it's hard to breathe

831
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,160
so the cause of asthma

832
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,960
But this is in the past, for example, more than 30 years

833
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,240
when it comes to breathlessness

834
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,080
Everyone said this is the reason

835
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,600
but now we know

836
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,160
In fact, it is such an important role as Information

837
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,400
Information For example, the production of its mucus

838
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,720
also cause difficulty breathing

839
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,480
also because of the inflammatory response

840
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,200
In addition is

841
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,620
maybe not easy to imagine

842
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,500
but in the process

843
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,120
In fact, it is equivalent to having injury in this part

844
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,820
I just said that inflammation is trauma, internal injury

845
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,860
This can also be thought of as a kind of internal injury.

846
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,800
This internal injury is actually caused by an inflammatory response.

847
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,660
So which is the cause and which is the effect

848
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,220
it is hard to distinguish

849
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,160
but what if

850
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,960
Here's what caused it in the first place

851
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,720
not sure

852
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,360
But with this inflammation

853
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,200
after inflammation

854
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,160
It's going to be kind of hurt over here

855
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,120
Repay after injury

856
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,820
But it keeps hurting and repaying

857
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,720
The final result is that the lining on this side is getting thicker and thicker.

858
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,120
The thicker the pain the less

859
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,320
Plus it's smaller after muscle tension

860
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,760
So it's hard to breathe at this time

861
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:58,760
So it is also a relationship between inflammation and disease

862
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,760
words here

863
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I didn't know why these patients had some inflammatory reactions

864
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
But in the end the inflammatory response is what affects the disease

865
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And let this disease to the end and even to the extent of life

866
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
That inflammatory response plays a big role

867
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
good

868
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
So what about national treatment and prevention?

869
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
In this raw material, what I want to talk about is

870
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
We learn more and more about the inflammatory response

871
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
The development of science is really long-term

872
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Maybe you won't see it in the short term

873
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
But like this allergic reaction

874
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I used to know that there was such a reaction

875
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Gradually know what kind of cell I am

876
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
For example, mast cells

877
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
What about this progress?

878
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
will let us know how to treat

879
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And here is a good example

880
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
so it's farther away after

881
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Our treatment methods are getting better and better

882
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
that's just generally speaking

883
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
we want a cure

884
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
One is to avoid allergens

885
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Of course, if there are no allergens

886
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
not sensitive

887
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
but it's hard to do

888
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
then follow some statement

889
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It depends on the organization

890
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
For example, I want this

891
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I think you have some

892
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Maybe use this too

893
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
to sustain this statement

894
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
sensitive reaction

895
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
That kind of estimation is very effective

896
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
it has many side effects

897
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
The method of desensitization

898
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
just if you know it's

899
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
sensitive to what

900
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
is sensitive

901
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You can use the doctor will take allergens

902
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
very small doses

903
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
inject it

904
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Then slowly increase the dose

905
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and after a while

906
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
this body

907
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
know exactly why

908
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
The amount of IgE is getting less and less

909
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
That's why you're allergic to this one

910
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
less and less

911
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
so this is one way

912
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,500
this very old way

913
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
but still continue to use

914
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,500
But what I want to say most is

915
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,500
Antibodies against IGE

916
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,500
this latest

917
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,500
is a recent development

918
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
Then this Professor Zhang Ziwen

919
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,000
He is also on this

920
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
His company at the time, Tennox

921
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Later, I cooperated with Ginetic two

922
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
developed this

923
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
called Omalizma

924
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,500
or one of his

925
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,000
Also called Zoleia

926
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
But these antibodies

927
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
He can

928
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
just to see the IGE

929
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And let the IGE let the IGE

930
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
won't be able to have his activity anymore

931
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
So draw it here

932
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
This is IGE

933
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Then this Anti

934
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Antibodies against IGE

935
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
So both of them are antibodies

936
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
One is IGE

937
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
One is an antibody against IGE

938
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So this IGE

939
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
was supposed to be responsible for the mast cell

940
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and then finally make this

941
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
mast cell activation

942
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Then the organization comforted and ran out

943
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
but now he won't let him

944
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,000
This is passed by the Department of Health in the United States to let him treat this Qishuang

945
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
In addition, it must be effective for rhinitis

946
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
rhinitis is relatively

947
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Rhinitis may not be completely IgE

948
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So his main effect may not be useful to everyone

949
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
But it should be useful for rhinitis

950
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Just say if you need to use this

951
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Because he has a lot of sense of safety from organization N, Histamine can use it

952
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Also he has food allergies which should help too

953
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Another example we are talking about is Solitis

954
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It's also a skin disease

955
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Also because I'm a dermatologist

956
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
So I would like an example of a couple of skins

957
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I think 10% to 20% of people have the sensitivity just mentioned

958
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Less for Solitis

959
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,000
In Europe and the United States, it is 2%-3% of the population

960
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
will be dangerous

961
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,500
For Taiwan, this number is 0.2%

962
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,000
I think it's a little on the low side

963
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,500
i think it should be

964
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,500
if it's that low

965
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,000
should have gone

966
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,500
maybe an epidemic

967
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,500
Experts should just look at

968
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,500
Do you know why it is so low

969
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,000
but i think it should be

970
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
about the same

971
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,500
So this figure is not reliable

972
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,500
so probably

973
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,500
I think it is

974
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,000
words from all over the world

975
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,500
About 2%-3%

976
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,000
This is a recurrent chronic dermatitis

977
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,500
recurrent in fact

978
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,500
it is in fact

979
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,500
If there is such a risk

980
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,000
is a lifetime

981
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
but it's better sometimes

982
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
especially if you heal

983
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,500
but even if

984
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,500
After getting better

985
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
it will also be in

986
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,500
one for treatment and one for medicine

987
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,500
it will recur

988
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,500
but it's not contagious

989
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,500
the skin will thicken

990
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,500
Then there is the thick cuticle

991
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,000
vicious door bubble

992
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Another name is medical disease

993
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
on this epidermis

994
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Needle skin has more capillaries

995
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
then inflammatory cells

996
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
can be seen inside

997
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So it's an inflammatory response

998
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
a skin disease

999
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
The skin of the whole body will be affected

1000
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
For example, the skin includes buttocks, nails

1001
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
more importantly

1002
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
We now know it's not just the skin that's affected

1003
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It's a Metabolic syndrome

1004
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
it's blood generation syndrome

1005
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
So we need to pay attention to these patients

1006
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
heart problem is it diabetes

1007
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Usually they are a bit fatter

1008
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
so it is

1009
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
What we now know about this inflammation

1010
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
It's also related to inflammation

1011
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Although skin inflammation

1012
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
but it affects the whole body

1013
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So now there's a fluke

1014
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
There is a name called blood generation syndrome

1015
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
the patient

1016
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Under this example

1017
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
It affects 80% of the skin

1018
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
very serious

1019
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Look at this in recent years

1020
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,520
This is what it shows

1021
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,760
this is the slice

1022
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,400
Microscope to see

1023
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,000
Normal skin probably slightly

1024
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,280
at most this thick

1025
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,400
this word

1026
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,440
Much thicker than normal skin

1027
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,400
Here are the ones with inflammatory reactions

1028
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,960
responding cells

1029
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,320
if dyeing

1030
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,280
you can see the cells that are inflamed

1031
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,320
these are here

1032
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,440
quite severe inflammatory reaction

1033
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,680
then cause the skin cells

1034
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:45,200
multiply and become thicker

1035
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,080
This is probably the most complicated one in my original house.

1036
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,320
So what I said earlier

1037
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,800
reduce it a bit

1038
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,360
That is, what is the reaction to Mingchang?

1039
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,440
here

1040
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,280
let's talk a little bit more

1041
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,040
because i want

1042
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,160
You probably know a little bit more about it just now

1043
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,280
Each page responds to the manufacture of B cells and T cells

1044
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,840
So we're a little bit under Adventure

1045
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,920
The ones below this one won't be reclaimed anymore

1046
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,120
Another thing is

1047
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,400
here is a good story

1048
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,600
is the development of our treatment of tinea liver

1049
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,720
It's true, it's our scientific development

1050
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,920
a good example

1051
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,440
help with this disease

1052
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,240
So the words of the hand cancer doctor

1053
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,200
It also starts with external stimuli

1054
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,320
There will be internal injuries after stimulation

1055
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,320
It’s not necessarily obvious what kind of stimulation it is

1056
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,280
but always hurt

1057
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:51,800
That is, the cells in the dermis will be injured

1058
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,800
or some infection

1059
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,440
Finally, the extremely strong cells will activate

1060
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,760
this is what i just said

1061
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,160
He's the whole guy who stays on the 18th

1062
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
equal to oneself

1063
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
This is equal to itself, it will secrete

1064
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
For example, this is cytokine

1065
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Cytokines

1066
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
In fact there are dozens of

1067
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I just said

1068
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Sarcolemmal Liver Cheek Liver

1069
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
This is the cheek liver

1070
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
now in fact there is

1071
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
There are about 30 known cheek livers

1072
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Immunology

1073
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
getting richer

1074
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Immunology

1075
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Cells are not just cells

1076
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Kick cells come in a variety of

1077
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I won't talk about it today

1078
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Cheek Liver, Cheek Liver as well

1079
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
not just one or two

1080
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Instead, there are dozens of

1081
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
but for this

1082
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
love is understanding

1083
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
we just say yes

1084
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Focus at I-12 I-23

1085
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
These cause the proliferation of kick cells

1086
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
this kick cell

1087
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
and then secrete

1088
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
other cytokines

1089
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
It's called Interferon Gamma

1090
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
or TNF Alpha

1091
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
These will have two different effects

1092
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
One is inside the tissue cells

1093
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,300
Let the surrounding tissue cells secrete some other substances

1094
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,000
or let the tissue cells proliferate

1095
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,800
That's why the epidermis on the cell side becomes thicker.

1096
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:15,000
It also makes the blood vessels respond

1097
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,600
And the first cartoon is when the germs come in

1098
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,800
Vascular reaction, the white blood cells will come out

1099
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,000
the same here

1100
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Because these cells produced by this T cell

1101
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,400
It's low speed, it will stimulate the blood vessels

1102
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,000
The mononuclear spheres inside will come out.

1103
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,300
Then the mononuclear sphere still has the original myocytes

1104
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,300
They also produce TNFF like this one

1105
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,000
It also causes the secretion and proliferation of pericytes

1106
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,500
Then here the dry display is generated

1107
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:54,000
So this is a dry and pathogenic muscle transfer

1108
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,000
That's what has been studied over the years.

1109
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,420
Do step by step turn this into this

1110
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:08,580
As the mechanism of the

1111
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:11,160
Let me talk about this a little bit more

1112
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,080
is a disease

1113
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,080
that's why this stimulus

1114
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,880
clinically

1115
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,080
is there some kind of phenomenon

1116
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,240
That is, if hand cancer is almost cured

1117
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,280
Or you just have some skin diseases

1118
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,280
part of it doesn't

1119
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,080
But if you get hurt over there

1120
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,320
That part will still come out at that time

1121
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,820
Hepatic glands are also shown

1122
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,460
So say this is right

1123
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,960
after stimulation

1124
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,920
How to cause the activation here is not sure

1125
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,760
But there is a way

1126
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,360
let this show it's an irritation an injury

1127
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,160
that just said

1128
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,080
that liver gland is

1129
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:54,920
yes

1130
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,760
Cardiometabolic Neutralization Syndrome

1131
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,000
So it's not just

1132
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
liver gland

1133
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
It's inflamed

1134
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
hepatic glandular arthritis

1135
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Usually the hepatic glands start first

1136
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
say ten years later

1137
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
These arthritis will come out

1138
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
not everyone will

1139
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
For example, one hundred and twenty percent would

1140
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
have this arthritis

1141
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
quite serious

1142
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
that diabetes

1143
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
More patients with hepatic glands

1144
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
then in the liver

1145
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
People with hepatic glands usually

1146
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
They are also more likely to see obesity

1147
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Then these are Metabolic syndrome

1148
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
It's all about inflammation

1149
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
direct or indirect relationship

1150
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
What about the treatment?

1151
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
the traditional treatment

1152
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
lots of lotion

1153
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
salve for inner lips

1154
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
you can imagine

1155
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
If the whole body has it

1156
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
it's going to be very difficult

1157
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Apply this to this clean place

1158
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
off line treatment

1159
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
This is usually done with UV light

1160
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
this is local

1161
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
But it can also be done for the whole body

1162
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
the stomach medicine

1163
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It is Metroflexid

1164
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
pretty strong medicine

1165
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:08,000
But it has some side effects, such as the liver, not cause hepatitis

1166
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
The recent progress is like this, which advertises the treatment

1167
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Just now I mentioned the method of TNF, TNF is Trumer Necrosis Factor

1168
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
here, here oh, here

1169
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I'll talk about TNF Alpha later when I talk about Trumer

1170
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
very important cell technology

1171
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:44,000
So these pharmaceutical companies want to say that since TNF Alpha can cause hepatitis to hepatitis

1172
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
So should we also make this antibody to cover it

1173
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
just make it inactive

1174
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:58,000
The IGE we just talked about has antibody antibodies, preventing IG from acting

1175
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Similarly, antibodies can also be made

1176
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Don't let this TF Alpha work

1177
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So he can't do anything to affect the keratinocytes

1178
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Then this is the first company made by Sentako

1179
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
At this time, it was because of the antibodies produced in the mice

1180
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
So he later had part of the mouse protein

1181
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
The other company is Ebbett

1182
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
He turned him into an antibody that is all Human

1183
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
The other company belongs to MGN

1184
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
He does it with his receptors

1185
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Because his receptors are supposed to surround TF Alpha

1186
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Don't let him say let him not work

1187
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
It can only work on cells

1188
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
But if he divides it out, it is not on the cell

1189
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
But when he took it out, he would wrap it up to prevent him from functioning.

1190
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:53,000
So these are the drugs made by these three different pharmaceutical companies

1191
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Now patients with clean stomachs can use it

1192
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Then this is a pharmaceutical factory

1193
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,120
Twice a week used to be like inserting medicine

1194
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,080
plug in every day

1195
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,880
That said, it's only been about three months

1196
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:10,500
twice a week

1197
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,440
But then once a week is fine

1198
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,920
That's every two weeks

1199
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,240
That was about two or three years ago

1200
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,520
Another company made this one from Synical

1201
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:27,880
It acts on i12 and 23

1202
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,520
then come back here

1203
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,160
Here are the packed cells

1204
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,720
It was first clearly 12 and 23

1205
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:39,600
and then cause these reactions in the later stage

1206
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,880
Then what their company does is

1207
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,720
just made antibodies

1208
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,160
i12, i23 able to get lost

1209
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:53,120
Then this is the injection of the patient

1210
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,320
Then call again in a month

1211
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,040
Then every three months

1212
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,920
It becomes four times a year

1213
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,960
four times a year

1214
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,740
I can fight myself

1215
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,500
I just came out with one

1216
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,340
very serious patient

1217
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,440
After playing like this

1218
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,740
he will stay for a while

1219
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,740
he has almost nothing to love

1220
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,640
so this is very big

1221
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,940
and make people feel

1222
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:20,840
There are some developments to be excited about

1223
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:24,140
is our response to inflammation

1224
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,580
The same goes for other diseases

1225
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:26,940
after knowing more

1226
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,940
Then our medicine will be better

1227
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,940
good

1228
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,440
Let's talk about the other two chronic inflammation

1229
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,840
I don't know when

1230
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,540
Time Magazine above

1231
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,440
Especially when it comes to Information

1232
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,140
Talk about being a Secret Killer

1233
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,540
Just those psoriasis, sensitive

1234
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,840
What we know is obviously that there is

1235
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,140
Then know it's inflammation

1236
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:53,940
but in some cases

1237
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,240
We don't know there is inflammation

1238
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,940
or unexpected inflammation

1239
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,940
be the cause of disease

1240
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It's serious in the end

1241
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Here's what it says

1242
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Suppressing link between inflammation and heart attacks and cancer and Alzheimer's

1243
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Let me talk, I will talk about heart attack and cancer

1244
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Y'all know Alzheimer's is dementia

1245
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
is a serious problem

1246
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
In fact, we now also know that he is such an important role as Information

1247
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
There is information in the brain of the patient

1248
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
And he ended up getting Alzheimer's symptoms

1249
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I saw a news yesterday

1250
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,000
was published in the journal Nature Medicine

1251
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
they had a team i no longer remember which school it was

1252
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
There's a mouse, they're Genetic Modified mice

1253
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,000
He started this automatically after their rat quarantine

1254
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
don't use any way

1255
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
He will automatically develop symptoms like Oscar

1256
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:12,000
In addition, we know that Oskanme just said that it has something to do with the reaction to the speech

1257
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:19,000
In fact, two important

1258
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
not rely on them

1259
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
But the important roles of these two battles are I-20, I-12, and I-23

1260
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It's about SWICE

1261
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
The team injected I-12, I-23 Anybody into this mouse

1262
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
like swice patients

1263
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
As a result, one month later the mice were initially injected

1264
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
After a month his symptoms were reduced by 30, 30, 40%

1265
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
If there are some rats that already have symptoms, call him again

1266
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
He will also reduce the symptoms of Oscammy

1267
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
So I believe this will be doing clinical trials soon

1268
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Because this medicine has been used for infection

1269
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
So is it in Oscar now?

1270
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
it will also be useful, it will be helpful

1271
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
But we can actually expect to say whether there is

1272
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Is it an advance in this regard?

1273
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
So it is said that it can treat Alzheimer's

1274
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Of course, there will be other advances in the future.

1275
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I just hope that after understanding this information

1276
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
able to have better medicines

1277
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Then Alzheimer will not talk about it

1278
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Then talk about Heart Attack and Cancer

1279
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,000
So what I said earlier is what we usually see

1280
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
of the disease, all of you are experienced

1281
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Then I will talk about it later, I hope everyone

1282
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
is not affected

1283
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
But this normal Colonial artery

1284
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
This coronary artery

1285
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
this young time

1286
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
We want our coronary arteries to look like this too

1287
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
But gradually there will be some cases

1288
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
there will be some arteries on weekends

1289
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I'm in the past

1290
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
In particular, the original lecture should be learned

1291
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
But it is good to keep Azure Scrooge

1292
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Then you see its blood vessels become narrow

1293
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
At this time, if there is Block Cloud

1294
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
it doesn't work at all

1295
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
At this time, because of the coronavirus, buying more is

1296
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
need blood transfusion

1297
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:28,000
And Nutrition to the cells of the heart

1298
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Therefore, if the blood vessels cannot be blocked

1299
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
These blood vessels will die

1300
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
At the end is a Heart Attack

1301
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
This definition is because

1302
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Substances of Fat and Cholesterol

1303
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Scores in vessel B which lead to vessel imprinting

1304
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
so it's normal

1305
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
And here's Azure Scrooge

1306
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
It's called a plaque and it seems to be

1307
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
About 1000 people, there are about 7 people

1308
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
But this is the whole population

1309
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Of course it will be the most when you are older

1310
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
In the U.S. there are approximately 5 million

1311
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
get this arteriosclerosis

1312
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
What about the symptoms?

1313
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
words in the heart

1314
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
dear words

1315
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
there will be pain in the heart and feet

1316
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
words in that

1317
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
fatal myocardial infarction

1318
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
brain words

1319
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Feel dizzy and headache when kissing

1320
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
when the face is heavy

1321
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
there will be a stroke of haste

1322
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
When the blood vessels in the feet

1323
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
some

1324
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
ischemic necrosis of lower extremities

1325
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
that sometimes have to

1326
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
congealing

1327
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
then you can save your life

1328
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
why?

1329
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
the reason is

1330
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
of course

1331
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
the disease just mentioned

1332
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
almost always some

1333
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
family death

1334
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
would be more stupid

1335
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
This is no exception

1336
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
that time of aging

1337
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
This heart is easier to harden

1338
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
What's more, high blood pressure

1339
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
also a big reason

1340
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
the diabetic patient

1341
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
easier to get

1342
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Can be used until hardened

1343
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
external factors

1344
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
If it is a film and television with a bold process

1345
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I think you should be very clear

1346
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Or smoking will harden this anime too

1347
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
The reason is what is its mechanism?

1348
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
If collesterol is high

1349
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
especially low density

1350
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
A wave of protein

1351
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:34,000
It will settle down in the school tube

1352
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
it will be modified

1353
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
modify is actually oxidized

1354
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
These oxidized LDA

1355
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:47,000
will be eaten by megalithic cells or aggregated cells

1356
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
These produce an inflammatory response

1357
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
The entire school tube has some inflammation around the week

1358
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
And the final result is anime hardening

1359
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,400
This is a beautiful cartoon

1360
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,400
write slightly more clearly

1361
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,400
this is LDL it will come in

1362
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,400
Cholesterol

1363
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,400
then it gets oxidized

1364
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,400
how is it

1365
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:19,400
It will activate the B cells of this blood vessel

1366
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:23,900
Then Molicyte will come in

1367
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,900
After coming in, it will clear Modified LDL

1368
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:27,900
Oxidl LDL

1369
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,400
Then it ends up being all in

1370
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,800
We are called Formcell

1371
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,800
This is also easier to activate

1372
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:38,300
And it secretes some substances that cause inflammation

1373
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:43,800
So here it becomes and these Colesterols are there

1374
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,800
another inflammatory reaction

1375
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,300
This is blood going on here

1376
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,800
this is a blood vessel

1377
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,300
Here are blood vessels B

1378
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,800
So the word here is the so-called plaque

1379
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:59,200
At the same time, this inflammatory response will make the

1380
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
muscle cells proliferate

1381
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Then it will bury and come to this place

1382
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
So blood vessels are getting thicker and thicker

1383
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
less and less blood vessels

1384
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Getting smaller and smaller

1385
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
So it can be seen here

1386
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
That's where the plaque is created

1387
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
muscle cells here

1388
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
these are cells

1389
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
You can see the words here

1390
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
here is getting thicker

1391
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
But here the coins of the blood vessels of the cells

1392
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
is getting thinner

1393
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
If compared with the original

1394
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
The port is getting smaller and smaller

1395
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
If there's an inflammatory reaction here, it's going to be a problem.

1396
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
that's what's causing this side

1397
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
will affect the injury here

1398
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
So many inflammatory reactions will be linked with injury

1399
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Here, in this case, when there is injury

1400
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
It's like saying this is when we usually bleed

1401
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
it has solidified

1402
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
like i just said it was the one

1403
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,220
There will be bleeding when the wound will come in the school version

1404
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,140
Of course it freezes, and it's the same here

1405
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:08,140
Here's the last thrombus

1406
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:09,980
After a thrombus occurs, this side will not pass through.

1407
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:13,320
Then this is what causes HotelTab

1408
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:17,080
The same is for us to know and say yes

1409
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:21,920
This arteriosclerosis is related to inflammation

1410
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,020
So many companies began to study to see if inflammation

1411
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:29,820
See if the inflammatory drug can treat this heart disease

1412
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:32,380
Many of these children in the face to face tree

1413
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:33,880
Let me give you two examples

1414
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,680
The first one is that this is anti-oxidation of LDA

1415
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,480
I just mentioned that LDA is oxidized first

1416
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,560
and then cause this inflammatory response

1417
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,960
If it can prevent it from oxidizing

1418
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,420
maybe this helps

1419
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:46,920
That's more to do with inflammation

1420
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:52,660
This is a kind of regionalized silver, this is Kinokain

1421
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:58,300
So this company is making this Kinokain not work

1422
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,300
And this monocyte will not have

1423
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
It will not enter the study of learning, nor will it enter this class

1424
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
So this is still in the second issue

1425
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
The last paragraph is the relationship with Cancer

1426
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I think this must be

1427
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Fort de la Léz cancer is now our

1428
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
is the most difficult

1429
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
a disease of the handle

1430
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Also most in need of research development

1431
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:34,000
and then hope to get a well-developed drug

1432
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
This Cancer is indeed

1433
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
In the past many years, I did not think of the relationship with Information

1434
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
But now, you look at the textbook

1435
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
clearly written

1436
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,000
That is, Information is a very important role of the website.

1437
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
play a very big role

1438
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
there are two points

1439
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
one is in that

1440
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,040
In case of chronic inflammation

1441
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,640
Cancel will develop

1442
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:10,400
For example H.Pylo-E

1443
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,520
Helicopter-Pylo-E inside the stomach

1444
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:17,480
This can cause gastritis

1445
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:22,240
But if it is said that this treatment is not removed

1446
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,000
Over time, some people

1447
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,400
Among many people, he will know about gastric cancer

1448
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,000
That's another Inflammatory Bowel Disease

1449
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,520
Just inside the Colon

1450
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,760
it will have long term information

1451
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,440
This is in a small number of patients

1452
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,960
It will end up with Colon Rectocancin

1453
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,560
Then in Taiwan, it is more often Hepatitis

1454
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:45,400
Hepatitis B or C

1455
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,120
This causes viral infection

1456
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,640
followed by an inflammatory response

1457
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,640
when it comes to the end

1458
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,000
Some patients develop hepatitis and liver cancer

1459
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,960
It's an inflammatory reaction

1460
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,360
after becoming a chronic inflammatory reaction

1461
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,440
In some cases it can also cause CANS

1462
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,400
So this is the first example of the relationship between inflammation and CANS

1463
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,440
If you draw it here, you will be a good boy.

1464
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,960
Here is an inflammatory reaction

1465
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,720
That should be a normal cell

1466
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,400
it turns into cancer cells

1467
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,120
That's why it's like this in detail

1468
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,320
not entirely clear

1469
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:23,400
But what we know is that these inflammatory reactions

1470
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,720
some inflammatory factors

1471
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,040
Can cause some genetic changes in this normal cell

1472
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,600
For example mutation

1473
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,080
After the mutation is generated

1474
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,880
This cell becomes a cancer cell

1475
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,360
The other relationship with the inflammatory response is

1476
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:37,640
After becoming a cancer cell

1477
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,440
Surrounding cancer cells is an inflamed

1478
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,480
is an inflamed

1479
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:45,240
is a response to inflammation inside

1480
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,000
How does that cause an inflammatory reaction?

1481
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:47,880
not entirely clear

1482
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,800
But of course cancer cells secrete a lot of

1483
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,600
Even what I just said was Sedkar

1484
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,440
Chimocha will be secreted

1485
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,320
so it attracts these

1486
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,040
these inflammatory reactions

1487
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Some people say that cancer is like an injury that cannot be cured

1488
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
So the host is always thinking about repairing it

1489
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
repair it is the reaction of pronunciation around here

1490
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Then we knew about cancer in the past

1491
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
It is continuing to reproduce in it

1492
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
and its cells are less likely to die

1493
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
so let's just say

1494
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
let's just talk

1495
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
let's just talk

1496
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
let's just talk

1497
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
let's just talk

1498
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
let's just talk

1499
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Cells are less likely to die

1500
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Then cancer it needs blood vessels

1501
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
to supply it with oxygen

1502
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
or its nutrient

1503
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Then it also knows how to

1504
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
make new blood vessels

1505
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
then its immune system

1506
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Society sees cancer cells

1507
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
and want to remove it

1508
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
But cancer cells also know what to look like

1509
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Evade elimination by immune cells

1510
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,000
But now we know that when you put in the persistent chronic inflammation

1511
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Right around this Cancel, it has been chronically inflamed

1512
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:15,000
And this chronic inflammation, as mentioned just now, it will cause the gene to have mutation

1513
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:21,000
At the same time, it will promote the proliferation of this cancer cell just now

1514
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
It promotes the formation of blood vessels

1515
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And then finally, hepatitis, and finally that cancer cell washes into nearby cells

1516
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,000
In the end, it will spread, the factors of these inflammatory reactions

1517
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
or its cells will facilitate this process

1518
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:48,000
So this is a great idea that inflammation leads to cancer, now a thought

1519
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:56,000
If this is the case, then see medicine, can inflammation medicine be useful in treating cancer?

1520
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:03,000
This is indeed the case, it is IceBrain, the medicine we use very often

1521
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
we know it looks inflammatory

1522
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Therefore, in a clinical trial

1523
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
visible

1524
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
we know we probably

1525
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Should be after the age of 50

1526
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
can eat spring

1527
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
otherwise eat a small amount

1528
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
So some people have eaten spring

1529
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I have eaten it for more than 20 years

1530
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
It plays a role in the risk of colorectal cancer

1531
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
It is indeed less than no food

1532
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
30% 40%

1533
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
So this is a

1534
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Proved to be inflamed on coffee

1535
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
can be slightly reduced

1536
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
cancer cancer

1537
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
A Proof of the Rate of Interest

1538
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Of course more research is needed

1539
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
work to learn more about this

1540
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Also this is right

1541
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
prostaglandins

1542
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Looks like inflammation medicine

1543
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,260
In fact it's endosterol

1544
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:04,220
These two words are more commonly used

1545
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:05,560
from arthritis

1546
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,620
for pain

1547
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:09,660
It is now clinically proven

1548
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:14,060
In fact, it is helpful in the treatment of cancer

1549
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:18,560
I think this is the last one

1550
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:27,560
Finally, I would like to thank the postdoctoral students in the laboratory

1551
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,760
This is the first preparation

1552
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:35,660
It is the material I gave to the research institute of National Taiwan University

1553
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:37,920
For this popular science speech

1554
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,520
Please help me change it to a more popular word

1555
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:43,120
Then the most important thing is to put Chinese in

1556
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,120
Because in the United States for many years

1557
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:49,720
So if I speak Chinese, I need someone else to translate for me.

1558
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,720
then thank them

1559
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:54,220
Thank you for your attention

1560
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:55,220
Thanks

1561
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,560
we are very grateful

1562
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:06,720
And Liu Shouchang went from a good inflammatory reaction to a bad inflammatory reaction

1563
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:11,960
Even Bad Inflammation Causes Common Diseases in Our Humans

1564
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,020
we often talk

1565
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,560
What are the two most important causes of death in Taiwan?

1566
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,800
The number one cause of death is cancer

1567
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:22,920
The second leading cause of death is heart disease and stroke

1568
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:26,520
So in fact we used to think that

1569
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:29,680
These things like cancer cardiovascular disease

1570
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,180
Nothing to do with inflammation

1571
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,220
Now after we listened to Chief Liu's speech today

1572
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:37,760
I know that these common human diseases

1573
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,760
A very important cause of death is also related to inflammation

1574
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,720
We thank Chief Liu for his speech

1575
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,560
Now we follow net profit

1576
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,820
time for some Q&A

1577
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:47,860
everyone can ask

1578
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:51,160
Then we will ask Chief Liu to answer with you

1579
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,120
OK

1580
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,220
is there anything please

1581
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:55,120
ask questions

1582
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,120
Please use the microphone and introduce yourself

1583
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,320
okay thank you

1584
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,920
Hello, Mr. Liu

1585
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,600
Institute of Medical Informatics, Taipei Medical University

1586
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,820
One problem is that I didn't seem to specifically mention it just now.

1587
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:08,960
It is also related to speech

1588
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,500
But it's an autoimmune disease

1589
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,300
So derived from this

1590
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,960
Autoimmunity should always be irregular

1591
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,700
There have been some informational speeches somewhere in the

1592
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:21,700
Will he be related to the Egyptian government because of this?

1593
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:22,500
Thanks

1594
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,560
Okay, thank you

1595
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,360
Yes, autoimmunity was a very important one at the time

1596
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,360
is the immune system

1597
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,780
some are too strong

1598
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:36,680
Then he shouldn't be affected

1599
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,280
For example, to our own cells

1600
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,980
usually should not have immunity

1601
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:46,280
but there is no control

1602
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,280
So in the case of 4

1603
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,880
to ourselves

1604
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:52,080
own cells generate immunity

1605
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,820
Of course this is

1606
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:57,680
In addition to responding to the speech

1607
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,080
He is also closely related

1608
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Then this one is also immune

1609
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
As for the relationship with the sea

1610
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
As far as I know it's not that obvious

1611
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
some have , in fact there are

1612
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
in fact there is

1613
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
then i have to tell

1614
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
good question you said

1615
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
For example, hand cancer, liver cancer

1616
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I don't see it so far

1617
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
that cancer

1618
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
For example, liver cancer is an inflammation of the skin

1619
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
But it did not increase the incentives for skin cancer

1620
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
So it's not exactly one-to-one

1621
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
So what about autoimmunity?

1622
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Some autoimmunity does not mean more cancer

1623
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
but some words are

1624
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
For example, there is a thing called Polymycitis

1625
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
So an autoimmune response in the muscles

1626
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,000
that inside

1627
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
The motivation of that cancer is very high

1628
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
right

1629
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,000
I will teach you a few steps to solve it

1630
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,500
just go ahead and answer your questions

1631
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,000
come on this side

1632
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,500
ask the director

1633
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:13,500
Director just mentioned about liver gland

1634
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,000
ask the director

1635
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,500
What is the difference between hepatic gland and odorous dermatitis

1636
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:20,500
Thanks

1637
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,000
these two are different

1638
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,600
One is the liver gland is the love is

1639
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,000
The odor is A.Towelge-Metallis

1640
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,500
These are two different

1641
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,500
completely different disease

1642
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,000
and it can be distinguished

1643
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,500
Slicing is usually less needed

1644
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,500
you can see

1645
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:38,500
That is to look at its shape on the one hand

1646
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,000
So called morphology

1647
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,500
As for its cause

1648
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:43,500
have to be the same

1649
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,500
that's clean

1650
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,000
Odor allergic dermatitis

1651
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,500
I just told you

1652
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:49,500
With that B.M.

1653
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,000
related to asthma

1654
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,500
What about immunity

1655
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,500
Let's just say this with

1656
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,000
With that D2 TH2

1657
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
T cells

1658
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Type II related

1659
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
What about liver cancer

1660
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
it is now

1661
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,500
In the past we thought it was TH50,000

1662
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,000
Type I

1663
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
But now it is clear that it is

1664
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
another one

1665
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
The other one talks more and more

1666
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
specialized

1667
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
TH7T related

1668
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Yes these two are different mechanisms

1669
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Affecting

1670
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
different etiologies

1671
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
right

1672
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Just mentioned that liver cancer

1673
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
It is good for liver cancer

1674
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
what moisturizing lotion and that steroid

1675
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
dermatitis that signifies

1676
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Is it also necessary to use quality

1677
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Yes, just a few medicines

1678
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
almost all can be used

1679
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
right

1680
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
That is to say, on liver cancer

1681
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
use

1682
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
especially if internal alcohol

1683
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
is in

1684
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
emblematic dermatitis

1685
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
is available

1686
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Then what

1687
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Illuminated

1688
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
The same goes for ultraviolet light

1689
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
It can be used for dermatitis and liver cancer

1690
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
That's a pity that these

1691
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
These so-called Biotic

1692
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
that is currently in

1693
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
on allergic dermatitis

1694
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
not yet

1695
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
no other medicine

1696
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,960
So progress on clean is much faster than that

1697
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,960
Thanks

1698
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,460
In principle, I am an ordinary citizen

1699
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,460
i want to ask a question

1700
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:20,460
We just mentioned this term from the inflammation industry

1701
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:23,560
Then the general treatment with drugs

1702
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:26,900
Inflammation is a principle code anti-hours

1703
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:32,400
Its ties to this inflamed industry

1704
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:36,400
What Actually Affects Inflammatory Industry Relationships

1705
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,900
This school question asks if you are

1706
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:44,400
This is what we talk about to see vitamins

1707
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,400
usually a bacterial infection

1708
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,900
shall we use it again

1709
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:51,400
So the first one is

1710
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,900
If there is a bacterial infection

1711
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:55,900
Look at the antibiotics to get rid of the bacteria

1712
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:58,900
Of course there were bacteria next.

1713
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:00,900
bacteria can cause

1714
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Initiation reaction

1715
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Since you don't have bacteria

1716
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
There will be no reaction at the source

1717
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
so here's an idea

1718
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
This is what we really see as numbers

1719
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
but

1720
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
in fact

1721
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
We now know a lot about numbers

1722
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
It has the effect of looking at the origin

1723
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
it depends on the role of origin

1724
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
so i don't want you guys

1725
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Do you have

1726
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Is it Echme please wait

1727
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
that that

1728
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
it's the usual way

1729
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
slightly more serious

1730
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Is to use antibiotics

1731
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
use that as a number

1732
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
In fact it works

1733
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Not exactly because it's bacterial drying

1734
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
It actually has bacteria

1735
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Will cause

1736
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Echme

1737
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
But its function is

1738
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
it looks at origin

1739
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
So there are a lot of viewers

1740
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
There is a function to see the origin

1741
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
So these two reasons

1742
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
is itself

1743
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
There is a function to see the origin

1744
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,440
I think that explains your problem

1745
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,440
I'm sorry, sir, I'll ask you a little more.

1746
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,440
Just now you said dry and salty is for life

1747
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,340
no way to eat fish

1748
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:15,040
Is there any way to eat fish with the smelly skin?

1749
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,040
Because now is the picture just drawn

1750
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:21,440
So it's okay, maybe 60 to 70% of children

1751
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:25,040
By the age of ten or so, there will be no

1752
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:27,440
sometimes come out later

1753
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:31,680
But one time it will get lighter and lighter

1754
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,980
in the end not even

1755
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:37,880
So it's more dry and salty than long-term

1756
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:41,380
Sixty to seventy percent of odorous skin

1757
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:43,980
will not continue the opportunity

1758
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:46,980
It's gone when you reach adulthood

1759
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:49,380
But my child is already in his twenties and thirties

1760
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:52,880
That's a pity to be in those 30s again

1761
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,880
So how can this be said to be questioned?

1762
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,920
Then questioning is like asking dry salty

1763
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
take medicine, keep taking medicine

1764
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:09,000
That is, so far, most of them are not compatible with that, and that is lighting

1765
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Illuminated

1766
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
So there is a chance that odorous dermatitis can be cured

1767
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
So it's me, it's me

1768
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Pharmaceutical companies in this area usually do not do much because most of the children have

1769
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Then also know that they will be gone after a while

1770
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
So it's a little bit more difficult for him to do clinical work in the children's department, yes.

1771
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:33,000
So usually, the one here usually cooks a lot more than dry and salty stir-fry

1772
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
But I believe so, now but I can mention that

1773
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
There is still gallbladder cleansing, the amine tire IGE just mentioned

1774
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:46,000
In fact, it is helpful for dermatitis, and it can be used

1775
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
So odorous dermatitis will fade with age

1776
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,000
It's different, it's when I was a kid, when I was a kid

1777
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
But grown-ups still sometimes, sometimes

1778
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I think there will always be

1779
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Yes, not necessarily clear

1780
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
not necessarily clear

1781
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Thanks

1782
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Thanks

1783
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Thank you for sharing

1784
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
what you just said

1785
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
50 years old or R10P person

1786
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Will reduce the suspicious rate of colorectal cancer

1787
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
That said, after colorectal cancer surgery

1788
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
eat R10P people

1789
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Will it reduce hair care rate

1790
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I don't know if there is any data here

1791
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I don't know if there is

1792
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
yes it is still possible

1793
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
yes it is still possible

1794
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
but i want aesthrin to eat

1795
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
i want to be there

1796
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
heart attack by that bath

1797
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
It's obvious from the top of the heavy madness

1798
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
So I also say this reason

1799
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
That's why I think it's edible

1800
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
low dose

1801
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
low dose

1802
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
in that

1803
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
The words above cancer

1804
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,400
Not saying it's 100 percent, it's just lowering the force.

1805
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:06,100
That data is quite obvious

1806
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:09,800
Only in the case of this complex flowering

1807
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,600
I don't think there's any data on this right now

1808
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,100
I knew it

1809
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,500
ask the director

1810
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,100
in terms of allergies

1811
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:25,700
Is there any way for that IG part

1812
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:28,700
Like exercising or avoiding drugs

1813
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:32,000
You can increase the possibility of IG

1814
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,100
This is the birth of this IG

1815
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:41,000
I guess there's always no downside in sports

1816
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,600
as long as you don't get hurt

1817
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,800
but on sensitive

1818
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,000
haven't said yes yet

1819
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,600
But movement is, on the one hand, e.g.

1820
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:53,200
if you are overweight

1821
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:57,600
Sometimes asthma is related to OBCT

1822
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,200
So exercise less

1823
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:06,540
is to reduce it

1824
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:09,740
These indirect effects on health

1825
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:12,580
this should help

1826
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:15,300
But for the generation of this IG

1827
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:19,740
These inflammatory mechanisms are sensitive to this

1828
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:24,740
As far as I know it doesn't say it will decrease

1829
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:31,720
yes

1830
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,720
right

1831
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:33,720
sultan ask

1832
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:35,720
Just now when you mentioned the allergic reaction

1833
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,320
mast cells

1834
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:40,720
Does this mast cell mean fat cell?

1835
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,660
Then it's inflammation and obesity

1836
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:45,400
with the one you just mentioned

1837
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,160
between cardiovascular disease and cancer

1838
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,520
What is its cause and effect relationship?

1839
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,400
Thanks

1840
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,200
That is not this mast cell is Massal

1841
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,320
you said fat

1842
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,400
In fact, I'm obese, I think you're obese

1843
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,840
may refer to fat cells

1844
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:58,720
And the point gill

1845
01:23:58,720 --> 01:23:59,920
those are two different

1846
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:00,920
obesity

1847
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,400
It is mast cell, it is Mass cell

1848
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,720
Then it is quite a unique cell

1849
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:10,560
It really has something to do with that sensitivity

1850
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:14,960
It is what makes the inside of our human body

1851
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,320
Probably this cell will produce Histamine

1852
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,800
I know this Nutriphia also produces

1853
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:20,880
but so far

1854
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,160
Probably what the textbook said is Histamine

1855
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,360
All Mass cells are produced by mast cells

1856
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,520
But this mast cell

1857
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,960
It is actually in other diseases

1858
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:37,040
There will be, there will be, and there will be

1859
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,360
even in cancer

1860
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:42,240
Mass cell also does research

1861
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:46,120
Mass cell has also been researched in the generation of cancer

1862
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,800
Also found that Mass cell will be effective

1863
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:52,280
Will contribute to the generation of cancer

1864
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:54,520
So it does a lot

1865
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:57,000
But it is more researched

1866
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,240
is a sensitive reaction

1867
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:00,560
Sensitive reactions are very many

1868
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
very obvious function

1869
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
later

1870
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
here first

1871
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Usually when we go to see a doctor

1872
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
The doctor will tell you to take some anti-inflammatory drugs

1873
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
According to ordinary people, the practice of turning the wheel

1874
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
So are anti-inflammatory drugs antibiotics or

1875
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
still sweating

1876
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Let the common people understand your

1877
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
The confusion is which one is called an anti-inflammatory drug

1878
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
I don't have that kind of experience

1879
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
so we know

1880
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Speaking of anti-inflammatory drugs

1881
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Anti-inflammatory drugs are here

1882
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
What kind of say an example is what

1883
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
as we just said

1884
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
is undaefermetary medicine

1885
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
there are some

1886
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
especially in taiwan

1887
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
many people say

1888
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
There are some

1889
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
inflammatory reactions are some

1890
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
this anti-inflammatory drug

1891
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
that's something like

1892
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Aspirin

1893
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
or something like

1894
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
to some of these

1895
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Some anti-inflammatory drugs like steroids

1896
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,000
These are the ones that are often opened in China.

1897
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
there is such a medicine

1898
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Now the question just now is

1899
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Are these anti-inflammatory drugs?

1900
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Since it's inflammation, it's not good

1901
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Then there will be all kinds of inflammation

1902
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
So should we take some anti-inflammatory drugs?

1903
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
anti-inflammatory drugs

1904
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Like Aspirin is a particle

1905
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Particles like Tylenol

1906
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Tylenol is an inflammatory

1907
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
is anti-inflammatory

1908
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Right, so that's probably a

1909
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Then there shouldn't be any harm in that.

1910
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
should be no harm

1911
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Of course the most effective anti-inflammation is the inner bone hip

1912
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
You can still eat when necessary

1913
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
For that fork, we usually

1914
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
As long as there is no residual error

1915
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
actually helps

1916
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,000
But if you look at the speech, these words

1917
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I think it depends on what kind of disease it is.

1918
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
yes what kind of disease

1919
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,000
If it is pain in these joints

1920
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
If talking about watching speeches

1921
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Probably this Ib Profit

1922
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
or memory

1923
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
or Tylenol

1924
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
There seems to be a problem behind that

1925
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
there is a problem with this

1926
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Please ask me for a long time

1927
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Current use of allergy medications

1928
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Which one works better

1929
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
As for the extent of his side effects

1930
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Is there any use of this aspect in traditional Chinese medicine?

1931
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Thanks

1932
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
When you say allergic, you mean like Bn

1933
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Yes, Bn's words

1934
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Bn is still Antihistimum so far

1935
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
It is the main medicine

1936
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
But if necessary, use internal bone storage

1937
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,000
But if it is slight, most Anti-Hismis can be

1938
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,000
As for, for example, Anti-IG

1939
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I think it should be very useful

1940
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
But it's a bit like killing a chicken with a bull's knife

1941
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
of course something

1942
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
especially you are very very sad

1943
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
is edible

1944
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
But then it becomes the so-called off-level

1945
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Because the U.S. Department of Health

1946
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Didn't say it was proof

1947
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
This is the thing to avoid smoking

1948
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
It is Azema

1949
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
But Moderny-Civill

1950
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
but in the US

1951
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Used in non-Moderny-Civill-Azema

1952
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I think there are still many people using

1953
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
but if it is slight

1954
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
if it's not that serious

1955
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I don't think you need to use this

1956
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
use this

1957
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
It is because of those biological

1958
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
is quite expensive

1959
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
The annual fee is in US dollars

1960
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Ten thousand and twenty thousand

1961
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,580
I have to say that I just mentioned a lot of scientific names and company names

1962
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:05,380
I really have no conflict

1963
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:06,900
No

1964
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:09,220
I don't have that stock

1965
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:11,780
Neither do I. I'm not and I'm not the one who invented it.

1966
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:14,080
There are many types of allergies

1967
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:16,380
some are cheap and some are expensive

1968
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:19,200
A tribute to some creatures like the ones just mentioned

1969
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,760
anti-IgE antibodies

1970
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:22,780
actually

1971
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:25,860
Insufficient not very severe symptoms of severe asthma

1972
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,400
But to use that medicine

1973
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,920
as we say

1974
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:31,740
Is it worth it to spend a lot of money?

1975
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:35,320
Of course, the health insurance will not be given based on Taiwan's history.

1976
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:39,160
Because your disease is not serious enough to need this drug

1977
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:40,960
is a general allergic reaction

1978
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,020
Or anti-organism drugs, etc.

1979
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:45,560
General health insurance will give

1980
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:46,840
but if to

1981
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,380
bio tribute section

1982
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:51,440
In the case of Taiwan's health insurance, the possibility of giving is probably very low

1983
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,000
unless it's serious like

1984
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,080
Teresa Teng's severe asthma

1985
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:59,840
Then this kind of medicine is likely to be needed at this time.

1986
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I'll come here first, okay?

1987
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
That's what I want to ask, I just talked about SARS

1988
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
It is because of the strong inflammation that destroys

1989
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
The tissue of the lungs means SARS

1990
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
The disease itself is not because the virus is too strong

1991
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,000
It's because of the inflammatory response he caused

1992
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Does it harm the human body? If you want something else, just ask again.

1993
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Does he have any other diseases like SARS

1994
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Thank you, good question, that's exactly what it looks like

1995
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Is his virus particularly strong? It's hard to say

1996
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Because it is completely determined by who is our body

1997
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
right , or that in this case

1998
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
His at least we know is the cause of death

1999
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,000
It's because our body reacts too strongly

2000
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,000
What part of our body sees him

2001
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Why do you know it's a virus

2002
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
different from other viruses

2003
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
so we want more reactions

2004
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
to be able to resist, to be able to resist

2005
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
is it because of this

2006
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I guess this aspect is not so clear

2007
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
We are just down to the end result

2008
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
it is indeed the cause of the final death

2009
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
or the cause of the sickness

2010
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
because we react a little too much

2011
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
but we have no control

2012
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
we didn't say yes

2013
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
If the same person doesn't react so much

2014
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
will there be a problem

2015
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
there is a problem not sure

2016
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
remind me of a

2017
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I didn't mention it

2018
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
If we know more about this

2019
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
In fact, these self-supporting organisms

2020
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
maybe useful

2021
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
We know what's in SARS

2022
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Cause this Sidecans stone

2023
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
words we now know

2024
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Then prevention is

2025
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Now I hear in the Middle East

2026
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
It seems that there are several cases

2027
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
It seems that there are 45 cases

2028
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Then two people in the family died

2029
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
If there is another SARS

2030
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
If so

2031
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Maybe Anti-TNF

2032
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,160
Give a few injections, at that time, if you give it impromptu, maybe it will be useful

2033
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:08,000
Is it right, and these two questions are

2034
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,320
Are there any other diseases similar to SARS?

2035
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:14,560
I think liver cancer is liver cancer

2036
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,720
It is HEP-10, heterosexual hepatitis

2037
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:21,960
In the beginning, especially type A, it's not chronic

2038
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:29,720
When it's improvised, it's kind of causing physical sickness

2039
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:32,520
actually an inflammatory response

2040
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:37,840
There's a problem here, come on, from here, wait on this side

2041
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,800
I'm talking to the general public, please ask

2042
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:44,880
Just now the president mentioned that some people have immune systems

2043
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:49,680
If it is stimulated by some foreign materials and causes damage, it will produce immunity

2044
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:54,800
It is IG1, which accepts the chemical cognition that produces certain specific stimuli

2045
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,760
then it will put the layered runny race, eye rewrite

2046
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
just some people wrong

2047
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
fault

2048
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I want to ask the director

2049
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
can be specific

2050
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
The stimulus of foreign materials

2051
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
which aspect

2052
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Is it the stimulation of foreign materials?

2053
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Okay, thank you

2054
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I just wrote an allergen

2055
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Allergens are all around us

2056
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
like pollen

2057
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,000
then drugs

2058
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
and dusty

2059
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
are foreign

2060
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
these words

2061
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
In fact, even if we can eat it

2062
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
none of us will have a problem

2063
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
especially if say

2064
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
If we don't have such a sensitive constitution

2065
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
these we will react to it

2066
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
but not sensitive

2067
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
but some people

2068
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
His physique is like this

2069
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
maybe it has something to do with clothes

2070
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
just accept this time

2071
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Our body has a reaction to it

2072
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
The result of the reaction produces IGE

2073
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
IGE in turn causes sensitive

2074
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
It's just that you just said that you have these symptoms

2075
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
That's because IGE

2076
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,940
I take the same pollen of these I don't generate IG

2077
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:07,840
But you generate IG, the difference is here like this

2078
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:12,840
this is what these are humlist

2079
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:17,840
It should be that we don't need to specifically react to it

2080
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,840
but we are responsive

2081
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,840
And in some people, its reaction is to cause IG

2082
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:23,840
sensitive

2083
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,840
It's probably as simple as this

2084
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:28,840
And it's usually possible to go

2085
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:33,840
Really have an allergic reaction to this allergist when it bothers you a lot

2086
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:36,840
You can take a test to see which allergies you are allergic to

2087
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:39,840
is an allergic reaction

2088
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:44,840
It can also help you do some tests for general immunology and epidemiology

2089
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:47,840
As mentioned earlier, some people are allergic to

2090
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:50,840
But some people most people don't

2091
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:52,840
So everyone's physique is different

2092
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:55,840
here is another question please

2093
01:34:58,840 --> 01:34:59,840
Thanks

2094
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:09,740
I'm sorry, Director Liu, does liver muscle function have anything to do with allergies?

2095
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:11,240
The second question is to say

2096
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:15,240
Recently, someone commented that eating good bacteria, probiotics or bacteria

2097
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:18,800
So does this good bacteria help reduce allergies?

2098
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,000
Thanks

2099
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:26,800
I'm not sure about the allergy just now.

2100
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:29,700
I think this about our human body

2101
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:36,600
It's the systemic symptoms I just talked about

2102
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:40,600
So I can't say that what I do will not affect other people.

2103
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,800
I think it is possible

2104
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:48,200
But I can't think of any information on this

2105
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:53,100
As for what you just said, it is

2106
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:59,100
I guess if I only know what's right it's

2107
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,160
Like things like Lexlectropacillus

2108
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:07,500
that's what i asked me to write

2109
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:11,420
thought I just mentioned that we now

2110
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:14,840
It seems that the sensitivity is getting more and more, and the allergies are getting more and more

2111
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:17,880
So why is this like this? There are different theories.

2112
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:21,320
There's a theory that we're getting cleaner

2113
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:25,160
So we are the first to go up during development

2114
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,520
we are not exposed to germs

2115
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,220
Bacteria I just answered a question

2116
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:30,920
I'm making it a little more professional

2117
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:33,820
That is, we see that the usual response of bacteria is to

2118
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:37,820
Type 1 T cells respond to TH1

2119
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:40,220
That's what we just said

2120
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:42,640
For our Ellogy, TH2 is the second type

2121
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:46,640
If it is your body that produces Type 1

2122
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:49,140
The second type will be less like this

2123
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:51,340
So according to this

2124
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:53,780
Just want to say if we let our body come

2125
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:56,140
to get in touch with this thing like a virus

2126
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:57,180
It's bacteria

2127
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,680
Then let's generate a comparison of the first type

2128
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:00,480
and just like that

2129
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,400
there is no second line

2130
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:04,040
but i guess it's a thought

2131
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:05,960
so is it because of this

2132
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:08,500
just to get some people to start trying this

2133
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:11,440
But what this does in this regard is

2134
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,100
try a lot

2135
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:14,440
doing this

2136
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:16,040
some seem to work

2137
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,040
some don't seem to work

2138
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:19,140
so no conclusion yet

2139
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:22,640
Is it possible to use this to treat

2140
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:28,440
these allergies

2141
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:30,140
not entirely clear

2142
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:32,680
But this also mentions

2143
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,600
Just what I just said is clean

2144
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,040
It doesn't matter

2145
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:39,080
I just mentioned the skin

2146
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:41,200
Maybe you didn't imagine

2147
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:43,400
think we have thousands

2148
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:45,200
Thousands of these

2149
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,300
not thousands

2150
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:48,800
but thousands of kinds

2151
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,880
sexual exercise here

2152
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:51,540
Our name is micropeiota

2153
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:54,000
That's what we do

2154
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,080
the same in the intestines

2155
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:56,840
I say this theory

2156
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:58,000
Put this other this like

2157
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,200
After eating Lactopacillus

2158
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,000
will appear to that

2159
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Those microphone towers inside will affect the

2160
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Affect those microphone towers

2161
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Affects our body's immune response

2162
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
it's amazing so quantum maybe

2163
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Through that relationship it affects this allergy

2164
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Maybe it's a possibility, that comparison is a little more complicated

2165
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I just mentioned the allergic reaction between SARS and the new arrival

2166
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Then I want to ask now because it has been seen clinically

2167
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Genital cystitis, then I want to ask

2168
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,000
This is also related to the allergic reaction

2169
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,000
I don't know what this is called

2170
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
how are you explaining

2171
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,000
TiCa then genital cystitis

2172
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Long-term is like cystitis

2173
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,000
you're thinking about that

2174
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,820
Yes, just name it

2175
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:04,620
I don't think that has anything to do with allergies

2176
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:06,660
it doesn't matter, yes

2177
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:09,980
It has nothing to do with the so-called allergies

2178
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:11,780
But what you say must matter

2179
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:13,320
speaking is relevant

2180
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:16,380
next question, come on, please

2181
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:19,460
that is

2182
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:22,260
microphone, click

2183
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:23,040
green

2184
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,340
May I?

2185
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:27,900
I want to ask the director

2186
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:31,220
Because I am a student of Xinzhuang Shixiep University

2187
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:32,500
two are

2188
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,040
Come to politics after surgery

2189
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:36,600
After surgery, my hand now often

2190
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:38,660
the forearm often speaks

2191
01:39:38,660 --> 01:39:43,260
If there is one more symptom before the speech, it will occur first

2192
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:44,800
eruption

2193
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,840
Sweat herpes followed by speech

2194
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:47,620
I want to ask

2195
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:48,640
this

2196
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:50,420
that sweat herpes is

2197
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:51,700
how

2198
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:53,760
how and why happened

2199
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:56,580
how to reduce how often it happens

2200
01:39:56,580 --> 01:40:00,060
Then keep doing this many times, will it affect

2201
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Please bring up other sequelae

2202
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Thanks

2203
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Sorry, my Chinese is not very clear

2204
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Han Leopard Clinic

2205
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000

2206
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Herbis bar

2207

Han Leopard Clinic

2208
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Han Leopard Clinic

2209
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
English is

01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
there is now

2211
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
have it now

2212
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Han Leopard Clinic

2213
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
no

2214
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
wait and see how you are

2215
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
right

2216
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I need to know more now

2217
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I want to ask the director

2218
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
I'm a high school student at Yan Ping Middle School

2219
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,000
I am very interested in biology

2220
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I read it in my school biology textbook

2221
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,000
When pathogens invade the human body

2222
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
The human immune system can

2223
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Thousands of B cells, NT cells

2224
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Select the one corresponding to the pathogen to deal with him

2225
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Then what I want to ask the director is

2226
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
How to choose the human immune system

2227
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Thanks

2228
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:09,260
I think your enough is probably a function of extremely strong cells

2229
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:15,400
I just said that the extremely strong cells are the last generals

2230
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:21,200
He'll tear viruses or foreign matter into it.

2231
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:24,600
Then he'll come back out

2232
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:31,080
Then this makes the T cell the T cell just mentioned

2233
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:37,920
At the beginning of the T cells, there is no need to know what will affect them

2234
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,160
but he will put this

2235
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:42,460
So I just said above what kind of antigen is the cell that presents the antigen

2236
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:43,840
Energy Presented Cell

2237
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:47,840
He will let T cells Educate

2238
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,800
Only then will the T cells know

2239
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:54,400
He will have an effect on that antigen

2240
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:58,400
Therefore, there was no exposure to this antigen at all.

2241
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,960
T cells are all the same

2242
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,120
But after the extremely strong cells penetrate this source

2243
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:06,720
it just shows up

2244
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:10,420
Then let the T cell know which source it should look at

2245
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:11,880
such a selection process

2246
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:16,820
In other words, there are mathematical types of T cells to choose from.

2247
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:19,200
Rather, let certain cells

2248
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:23,280
adicate becomes that it can respond to that look at the source

2249
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:27,120
The same goes for B cells

2250
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:31,200
There was another question here just now, is it gone?

2251
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,000
is there any problem

2252
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,080
ok our last question

2253
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:39,660
Ask our Deputy Director Li

2254
01:42:39,660 --> 01:42:42,220
Because you are also an expert in dermatology

2255
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:44,020
we have a friend

2256
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:45,800
his skin

2257
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:47,080
not clean

2258
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:50,680
One piece of white, one piece of white on the face and hands

2259
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:53,740
Seen by many dermatologists

2260
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:55,540
I want to ask the director

2261
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:59,120
What is his disease and what is the cause?

2262
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:00,060
what's the difference

2263
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Thanks

2264
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
see must

2265
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Are you talking about white spots?

2266
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,000
White spot is called Bertar Ligo in English

2267
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Yes, Bertar Ligo

2268
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
that words

2269
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,000
not so easy to control

2270
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
But the same goes for the liver, for example.

2271
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
illumination, illumination light

2272
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
can treat most

2273
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Where do some medicines look

2274
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
some medicine can rub

2275
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
In some cases, it responds quite well

2276
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
right

2277
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:38,000
He sees various dermatologists

2278
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I read a lot and didn't think about it

2279
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
served

2280
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Then the other one is

2281
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
A relatively new development is

2282
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
He wants cell transplantation, so it becomes stem cells

2283
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
This is because his rate of fire cells don't

2284
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
So if you say it's pancreas

2285
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
he can recover

2286
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
so that is a way

2287
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,260
For example, if the scope of influence is too large

2288
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:03,740
It's not conspiracy

2289
01:44:03,740 --> 01:44:04,860
but later development

2290
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:07,940
maybe from the dry bag perspective

2291
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:13,940
just some people will react

2292
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:14,940
some people will have

2293
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:16,940
Just two is one on steroids

2294
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:18,940
something else called

2295
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:24,740
The product name in English is called Protopic

2296
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:26,740
Protopic

2297
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:32,760
The director finally asks you

2298
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:33,000
that

2299
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,700
Is it related to allergies?

2300
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:38,260
Are you allergic to dermatitis?

2301
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:43,000
Significant dermatitis is skin

2302
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
also considered allergic

2303
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Thanks

2304
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
So what is being said is

2305
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
To spot this part

2306
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,400
this is small

2307
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,600
it's about the wife

2308
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:52,400
too sun

2309
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:53,800
He said it was more serious

2310
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:55,800
bigger

2311
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:56,600
This intentional eye relationship

2312
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:57,000
right

2313
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,600
Generally

2314
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:00,600
this may be

2315
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
it's not easy

2316
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
He also said no

2317
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
good

2318
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
we again

2319
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Thank you Chief Liu

2320
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
wonderful speech

2321
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
That

2322
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
give me one last minute

2323
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
That's what we learned in December

2324
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
want to test

2325
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
is up to us

2326
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
China Cultural Responsibility Institute's

2327
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Governance

2328
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
The researcher wants to speak

2329
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Our Vernacular Bible

2330
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
is a rather interesting subject

2331
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
so the time is in

2332
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
December 25th

2333
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Tuesday night

2334
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
also in this place

2335
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
to give a speech

2336
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
All are welcome to participate

2337
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Thanks
