1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,820
They are currently Riverside Excellence Leagues.

2
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,820
Please cancel this session.

3
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,280
Please let Mr. Tong Huni ring旦阛

4
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,980
and the ambassador

5
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,940
receiving the honors of his Korean relationship with the使衿携.

6
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,120
Hi, I am Wong Huni-J ק่ Easy to ask

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,320
Any questions for board members,

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,080
this morning I am describing to you

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
give this speech

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
this subject

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He is also very poetic

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
epic typhoon

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
in science

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And the subtitle didn't win on top

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The subtitles are in his hand

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Inaction is something Taiwanese must know

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Taiwan is

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
OK this is the subtitle

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Interesting

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Then I add another subtitle

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Typhoon Night Talk Typhoon Room

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I hope everyone can go home safely

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
before that started

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
still take this

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Director Wu introduced to everyone

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Although there are

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
but i think

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
we still want this

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Let me introduce this to you

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This Professor Wu Junjie

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
it was 1986

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Graduated from the Department of Atmospheric Sciences of National Taiwan University

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Then in 1993

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Massachusetts Institute of Technology

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Atmosphere of Earth from MIT

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,760
and a Ph.D. from the Department of Planetary Sciences

37
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,460
then to this

38
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,500
Princeton University Geophysics

39
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,300
Postdoctoral research in fluid power laboratory

40
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,040
After returning to Taiwan

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,800
Worried about doing this research questioned

42
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,300
Research on typhoons

43
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,900
Including the moving strength of the typhoon

44
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,540
The Far Wall and the Dynamics of Rainfall

45
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,640
Interaction of Typhoon with Terrain and Ocean

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,140
and make this strategic observation

47
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,740
It's the wind-chasing project

48
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,240
I still came to ask him yesterday

49
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,740
Their plane flew out again yesterday

50
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,040
Go to the typhoon show to observe this time

51
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,540
Typhoon Sura and more

52
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,340
Research performance is certainly top-notch

53
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,040
2007 2009

54
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,140

Lift research award

56
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,040
It's also the one in 2009

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,300
When the National Science Council was more than 50 years old

58
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,840
also choose this

59
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,240
One of the 50 scientific achievements of Taiwan

60
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,140
Currently in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences

61
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,140
Distinguished Professor and Head of Department

62
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,440
Also serving as the American Meteorological Society's

63
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,200
tropical weather and

64
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,740
member of the hurricane committee

65
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,200
Also our Republic of China Earth Science Society

67
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,320
editor-in-chief of a scientific journal

68
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,220
We welcome with warm applause

69
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,720
Director Wu

70
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
Goodnight everybody

71
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
I'm Wu Junjie

72
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,820
I would like to thank Director Peng for the invitation and the introduction just now

73
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,320
Then I feel very honored to be here today

74
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,220
Academia Sinica

75
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,680
And on this typhoon night

76
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,320
see so many

77
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,820
Our science community or one of our science popularization circles

78
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,460
come with me, let's interact

79
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,020
I wish I could today

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,120
Shared with you some popular science knowledge and information related to typhoons

81
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,160
can provide us with useful

82
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,720
very helpful

83
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,300
Then I will briefly introduce this topic to you.

84
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,940
The goal given here is a little bit bigger, so I think that when I was concentrating the time in the end

85
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,040
I think it will mainly focus on the scientific part

86
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,580
that slightly

87
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,140
If it is mentioned in the introduction I will put my

88
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,720
Some of a book translated a few years ago

89
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:37,120
Take it out as the subject of today's introductory reading, and then gradually enter the theme of typhoon to be discussed today

90
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:37,900
OK

91
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,500
That said, I am very touched when the typhoon is coming

92
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,140
This moment of calm before the storm can be gathered here with everyone today

93
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,180
As Teacher Kun said just now

94
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,000
Hope you all come back safe and sound today

95
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,760
I think

96
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,780
Not yet maybe but tomorrow night

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,100
Let's start with the typhoon that is about to occur.

98
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,100
You may have noticed that we happen to have a typhoon called Sula.

99
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,520
Just off the southeast coast of Taiwan

100
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,860
already very close

101
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,400
It's only about 300 kilometers away from us now.

102
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,100
Then this typhoon is gradually approaching the sea off the northeast corner of Taiwan

103
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,140
Then everyone can see that this is actually in the East today.

104
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,980
It seems to be doing the weather forecast at seven o'clock now

105
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,060
The typhoon is already very close to the coast of Taiwan

106
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,780
So its airflow also ushers in the rainfall in Huadong area

107
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,100
Especially between Yilan and Hualien

108
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,380
You can see that there has been a lot of rain

109
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,740
In fact, the rainfall will gradually increase.

110
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,540
Then the radar echo may mainly see that the rainband is only the periphery

111
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,940
The main rainbands are actually in the south of the typhoon in Taiwan

112
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,500
Fortunately, these are still in overseas seas

113
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,220
Then this is its cloud and soil and its position

114
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,580
In fact there is another typhoon at the same time

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,760
Taiwan is farther away from Japan in this direction

116
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,720
Then the typhoon will continue to move northwestward.

117
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
good

118
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,200
What about the typhoon?

119
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,000
In fact, our Central Meteorological Bureau has also made some official forecasts

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,800
You can see that this forecast has also been slightly revised in the past few days.

121
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,400
From the original it was gradually closer to the southern part of Taiwan

122
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,800
It became a typhoon to the east of Taiwan two or three days ago

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,800
As of yesterday and today, it has been corrected to the northeast corner or the open sea.

124
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,960
Well, although it is impossible for him to cross Taiwan directly

125
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,800
But if he's around us

126
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,000
This threat may still be quite large, especially the rainfall in the east, northeast and north

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,400
In fact, it is possible to be very high

128
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,800
So please pay attention

129
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,600
In fact, everyone can see that it is Taiwan's prediction that it is actually not read.

130
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,200
In fact, the official meteorological units of countries all over the world have done

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Then add that the computer models in each country are predicting

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Most of the predictions so far are pretty consistent.

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Pointing to typhoon likely to approach Taiwan's northeast corner

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's just a prediction of the center of a typhoon

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But everyone, don't forget that the typhoon itself has a size

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
range of hundreds of kilometers

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So in fact, our Taiwan will soon be shrouded in its sphere of influence

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So there are some risks, you may want to pay attention

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Of course, the question that everyone may be most concerned about

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This question is one that I cannot answer

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Otherwise I'm out of touch

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But let me do a simple poll

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If you live in Taipei City, please raise your hand

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Whoa, please raise your hand in New Taipei City

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
ok 2 to 1 but almost bigger

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Please raise your hand in other counties

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No, but I'm still very impressed that everyone came

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
However, I think there are two people who can help you answer this question.

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Then please watch this interview tomorrow

150
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,660
good

151
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,800
what's next

152
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,460
Let me tell you that we are Taiwan

153
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,540
I just happened to actually go from the US yesterday.

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,800
Columbia University visit

155
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,040
and I did a presentation

156
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,160
I actually found that report very moving.

157
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,360
because of that report

158
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,460
It's about research related to typhoons

159
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,660
However, an elderly man in his eighties came

160
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
come and listen to my report

161
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,360
Then this is called his name is Wallace Broker

162
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,060
He's the whole movie after tomorrow

163
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,820
messenger of scientific theories

164
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,820
That is to say why the ocean

165
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,820
He will have this master of the so-called gentle circulation

166
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,420
Then when he put forward this hypothesis forty years ago

167
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,320
Many people think it is impossible

168
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,360
it's out of the question

169
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,220
As a result, he is now the researcher

170
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,560
the most important issue

171
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,820
But very big

172
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,120
But the main point is

173
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,660
I was on the plane when I got back

174
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,360
Just hear about our nationality airlines

175
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,120
just playing once

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This song is promoting the prestige of the country and introducing Taiwan

177
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You may have heard his song

178
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
just sing whatever

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
she famous

180
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
have you heard

181
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
In Taiwan, I am fine with him

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Do you have

183
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This is our treasure island

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
that was hundreds of years ago

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
four or five hundred years ago

186
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
When these foreign ships pass by

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
so call our beautiful island

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
that's really beautiful

189
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
there are also many poets

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Describe our island in beautiful verse

191
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There are mountains, seas, winds and clouds

192
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's all introduced here

193
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
so very beautiful

194
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But although we live on this beautiful island

195
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But of course it's also nature's creation

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We happen to be in an area with a lot of environmental hazards

197
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
that is undeniable

198
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
we who live on this island

199
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It must also be beneficial for this

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
have a certain understanding

201
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Especially when we face several very large natural disasters

202
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
One is that we all know that the Pacific Rim

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This is the whole volcanic and seismic zone right here.

204
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What about the other side?

205
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
is almost the only place where the most active typhoons in the Northwest Pacific must pass.

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If I list the trajectories of these typhoon layers in this picture

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You can see that Taiwan is at the middle point of its final path.

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The Philippines, a little to the south, is actually quite serious.

209
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I happened to be eating

210
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Also with a listener who is Mr. Liang

211
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Also mentioned that he said he was also affected by the typhoon

212
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Affected his itinerary to visit the Philippines

213
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Then you can see us in the Philippines

214
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Whether it's the Philippines

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
or Taiwan is here

216
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll just call it this aisle called Typhoon

217
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
then i have to be careful

218
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We also have to take precautions against typhoons, which can cause disasters.

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And we have many in Taiwan

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
There is more rainfall due to the mountains

221
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Then the possibility of self-disaster is even greater.

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What if we look at some external data?

223
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Disaster In fact it is a

224
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Many This is a World Bank report in 2005

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He divides this main disaster atmosphere into six categories

226
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
For example, including earthquakes and volcanoes

227
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This is called landslide

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That is, there are still floods, sweat disasters and storms

229
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Then among the six major disasters

230
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What percentage of the population is in each country in the world

231
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
under his influence

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Ninety percent of our population in Taiwan

233
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
are affected by at least two hazards

234
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Seventy-three percent of the population also lives in

235
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Areas affected by three hazards

236
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So we are paving the way in relatively high-risk areas

237
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If this picture is used to show

238
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
you see our eyes

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,500
It is one of the few red zones in the world.

240
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,200
This is an analysis of a company from last year

241
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,000
It also highlights that

242
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,400
There are several economic activities in the world

243
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Those who received this very serious extreme disaster

244
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,300
Countries exposed to impact

245
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,200
These regions rank fourth in the world

246
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
except Taiwan

247
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,800
The United States, Japan, and mainland China

248
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,100
So we have to guard against typhoons

249
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,600
because we're in it

250
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Then start entering today's regime is a typhoon

251
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,500
We are indeed talking about Taiwan

252
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,600
On average, we have nearly four typhoons a year

253
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,100
will attack us

254
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,300
plus although the damage it caused

255
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,700
in fact it is obvious

256
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,200
This average is just a direct loss

257
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,200
It can probably reach NT$17.4 billion

258
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,200
In fact, both are more than 0.5

259
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,400
3% of nationally produced cats

260
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,900
on the other hand

261
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,200
We know that disasters caused by typhoons will cause floods

262
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,800
In fact, if the typhoon does not come

263
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,400
There will be drought in Taiwan

264
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,600
So it's still very scary for us

265
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,500
but can't live without it

266
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,800
That leads us to the question

267
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,700
is to pay great attention

268
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,300
What I will tell you again is that in recent years

269
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
Disasters caused by typhoons and floods

270
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,800
What about some changes that affect us

271
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,500
if we start here now

272
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,800
in 1990

273
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,000
It was that year, in fact, it was against Taiwan

274
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,400
The year with the most typhoons

275
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,800
A kind of eight typhoons

276
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,100
It is the record-breaking typhoon affecting Taiwan

277
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,800
Some of them are particularly serious

278
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,500
is the dean

279
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,800
it was 2001

280
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,700
yes this is 2001

281
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,600
In 2001 there were two

282
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,000
Two of the larger

283
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,100
One is Peach Juice and the other is Nali

284
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,000
at that time

285
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,800
since that year

286
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:09,500
The entire country of Taiwan has made a more planned disaster prevention and beach prevention measure.

287
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,200
So in later years we can also see

288
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,400
Although there are many severe or heavy typhoons passing by

289
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,000
real casualties

290
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,100
In particular, the number of deaths has been greatly reduced

291
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,100
So it seems that our active warning at that time

292
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,400
These actions related to the so-called evacuation of these dangerous areas

293
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,800
All have helped to reduce the disaster and casualties

294
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,300
But in 1997

295
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,200
the past 45 years

296
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,300
The number of people has increased again

297
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,500
Of course there is a special case because of the Morakot typhoon

298
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,400
but no matter what

299
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,500
After analyzing it, the scientists found that

300
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,200
Disasters in recent years are more of the so-called compound type

301
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,600
It is caused by the combination of elements of many different disasters

302
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,000
It's worth preventing

303
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,320
Its standard procedure is even more rigorous

304
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,720
Or to keep up with the changes in this disaster

305
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,280
to cope with it

306
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,800
Let me show you a few examples

307
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,360
An example you may be familiar with

308
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,480
What about this example of Typhoon Morakot?

309
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,720
means it happened with a very high rainfall

310
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,320
Within a limited period of about 3 to 5 days

311
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
What about the super high rainfall?

312
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,440
You can see this from the distribution of rainfall

313
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,880
That is to say, it lasts for two or three days.

314
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,480
Rainfall is very heavy

315
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,640
There are even many times when the rainfall per hour is close to 100 mm

316
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,680
That's 10 centimeters, 10 centimeters per hour.

317
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,320
That went on for hours or more

318
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,680
Well of course it brings it up on the hill for this some

319
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,200
Our mountain, this oxygen-rich soil

320
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,880
The capacity of oxygen-containing water is already saturated

321
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,760
So causing that excess pressure on the soil

322
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
In the end, the whole thing is a landslide or avalanche.

323
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,500
This massive avalanche of avalanche

324
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,200
Let this unfortunate disaster money

325
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,000
This is a still

326
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,200
It should be a village with a very good environment

327
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,800
Later, Xiaolian Village became like this

328
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,000
that's a big loss

329
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,500
It means heavy rainfall

330
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,600
But there is another type of rain

331
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,400
when the typhoon comes

332
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,300
is the total rainfall

333
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,700
But it rained a lot in a short time

334
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,900
It rained an average of 600mm in 6 hours

335
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,000
About 60 cm of rain

336
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,600
within 6 hours

337
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,900
Then our general drainage system cannot cope with this kind of

338
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,600
so-called very rapid heavy rainfall in a short period of time

339
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,500
Then this will also cause a flooding event.

340
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,200
If this kind of rain falls in Taipei City

341
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
No matter how good the water pump in Taipei City is

342
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,900
Maybe it's too late

343
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,600
so it's a very challenging

344
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,100
that is

345
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,160
That is to say, we now have some rainfall patterns that are very violent.

346
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Brings a lot of rain in a short time

347
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,500
Look at this example also happened two years ago

348
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,900
A case you may be familiar with

349
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,100
typhoon leki

350
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,300
Please raise your hand if you are impressed

351
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,660
Do you remember if you noticed that

352
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,460
At the beginning, the news mentioned the Suhua Highway

353
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,760
Unfortunately, two tour buses just fell down

354
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,460
It was this unfortunate accident that washed into the Pacific Ocean.

355
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,160
In this example the same means

356
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,860
it's four hours in a very short time

357
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,860
More than 100mm of rain falls every hour

358
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,160
under this amount of rain

359
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,760
also caused a lot of collapse

360
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,560
There are some areas like these areas around Suao

361
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,260
The problem of its rainfall causing disasters has been highlighted

362
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,120
Then this event we are in

363
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Now is the time for the government to regulate the impact of this torrential rain on us

364
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It also includes the control of traffic.

365
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Especially on this kind of rough road

366
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
When the rainfall reaches a certain level

367
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
its road is closed

368
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
to avoid this unfortunate situation

369
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
simply speaking

370
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I put my part about typhoons and disasters today

371
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
a simple section

372
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
report here

373
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
We probably understand that

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
our nature

375
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Taiwan is in such an environment

376
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Typhoon is a risk of self-disaster

377
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
These risks are of course mainly related to rainfall

378
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Of course there are other conditions including address

379
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But we also noticed

380
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The larger problem of the whole society

381
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
includes social change

382
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
population because we have a large population

383
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
and concentrated

384
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
because of land use

385
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Factors such as land development

386
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
lower limit of stratum etc.

387
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Let this natural original risk factor

388
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
more improvement

389
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
what's more

390
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
may be this is a very large one

391
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
A very important issue in the current scientific community

392
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
the whole change of climate

393
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That might also bring some new shocks

394
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
This impact includes the global

395
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What we call the issue of warming

396
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
This issue may also cause

397
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
part of the typhoon

398
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
or the torrential rain it brings

399
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
its increased strength

400
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
These changes may make

401
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
The risks we face are greater

402
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
In particular, various disasters will also load

403
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Those neutralizing effects

404
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Let's pave in the higher

405
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The environmental risks of these so-called disasters

406
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
then have to face this problem

407
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's the whole world now

408
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Not just one that we all pay attention to in Taiwan

409
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
combined with natural science

410
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Plus socioeconomic and so on

411
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
a major issue

412
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Then I think everyone today

413
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Coming here must also be very concerned about this issue.

414
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Well, I just had the chance to meet a few people today.

415
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It happened to be a colleague of the Central Plains Academy

416
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The Central Plains Academy also attaches great importance to this issue

417
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
There is also a research center called the Environmental Change Research Center

418
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
One of the key issues is also very related to this

419
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Now the Central Plains Institute is still promoting a

420
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
with this our worldwide international organization

421
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What about a combined unit?

422
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It is called IRDR

423
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It is an internationally relevant one

424
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
a research center related to the so-called method of disaster research

425
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
there is an office

426
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The office is located in Zhongyuanyuan

427
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's the former Liu Zhaohe and the vice president of our Central Plains Academy

428
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
leading this team

429
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
i think it's a big issue

430
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
still in progress

431
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I think if there is

432
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Especially young friends who are interested, etc.

433
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I think there will be opportunities in the future

434
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,800
Participate in research work related to these

435
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,560
then i'll start now

436
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,160
typhoon itself

437
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,760
Then to introduce the typhoon, I will use this picture to start

438
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,780
In fact if

439
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,620
Of course, few of you here may have the opportunity to say that during a typhoon

440
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,220
I really went inside the typhoon and flew inside to see the typhoon

441
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,300
If there is such an experience like this one

442
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,600
in the eye of the typhoon

443
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,440
This photo was taken while flying at an altitude of about 3,000 meters

444
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,760
What you see is actually very beautiful

445
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,040
of course we are

446
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,320
say he

447
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,400
From a scientific point of view, he is really a beauty

448
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,980
I say it's a beauty but of course he's also a beast

449
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,520
that this

450
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,800
this one

451
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,620
such a natural

452
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,160
what about him

453
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,960
Topics with lots of interesting science

454
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,760
our nature

455
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,780
Logically speaking

456
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,340
Why did he produce such a

457
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,340
Where's the giant beast monster?

458
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Why is the normal wind speed ranging from a few meters to 10 meters per second?

459
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,500
Why does it have such an unstable

460
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
it will keep increasing

461
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,500
In the end, every year in different corners of some seas around the world

462
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,000
would grow huge so-called storms

463
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And when it spins, there's no way to stop it

464
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The fastest possible wind speed can be as high as 60-70 meters per second

465
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That's basically destroying a lot of

466
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,500
these our trees and more

467
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
then it's raining

468
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,000
Just like the introduction just now, there are a lot of heavy rain

469
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
That's actually a very interesting scientific question

470
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And when I just ate

471
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,500
During the meal, I happened to chat with a colleague

472
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,000
In fact, what about this phenomenon?

473
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
how did it come about

474
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
how long can it last

475
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,500
how it moves

476
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,000
why its strength increases

477
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Then how strong can it be enhanced to the limit?

478
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
how much rain can it rain

479
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,500
Every scientific question is still being explored by many scientists

480
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,000
Of course it took many years of hard work

481
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,500
In fact, we understand more and more about these

482
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,000
Then of course I will share some interesting parts with you today.

483
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Another thing to mention is that

484
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
What about the depth of the typhoon?

485
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,500
The most special place is that it can only be found on the sea

486
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,000
Only in warm enough oceans

487
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Then it has a very close interaction with the ocean

488
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The interaction with the ocean itself

489
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Another very interesting natural science question

490
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
That is, two fluids with different qualities

491
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
air atmosphere and ocean

492
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
a very low density atmosphere

493
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
a dense ocean

494
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
how they go to each other how the wind blows the ocean

495
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
How the ocean affects the activity of the atmosphere through the exchange of heat

496
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
that's a very important issue

497
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
That's inside our typhoon

498
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
is a very fast atmosphere-ocean interaction

499
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Then everyone in this movie after tomorrow

500
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
What we see is also the interaction of the atmosphere and the ocean.

501
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
But that effect is a longer-term change

502
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
One of our oceans may be longer

503
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Changes in ocean currents from centuries to millennia

504
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
How to change our climate system

505
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
that's a very fundamental one

506
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
fun big one physical

507
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
or natural science issues

508
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Well, I can’t give you a detailed introduction to the typhoon itself.

509
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But I'll drop by and talk to you guys

510
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It shouldn't be called promotion

511
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
should introduce

512
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
This one was just a few years ago

513
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The book that I am involved in translating

514
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
This book is called

515
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
The Vine Wing is talking about the typhoon

516
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
That's called a giant wind in America

517
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
the original author of the book

518
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It happens to be my supervisor abroad

519
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Then he is a master researcher in this field

520
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,400
the master

521
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,800
That's also a member of the National Academy of Sciences

522
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,800
That's because my teacher published a book

523
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,100
It is a very good science book

524
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,400
I spent a year and a half a few years ago

525
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,800
just translate it into Chinese

526
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,600
right here

527
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,400
so come prepared

528
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,000
If you want to have a deeper understanding of typhoons,

529
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,400
in fact the book

530
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,200
It may also provide you with many useful ideas

531
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,300
Then I will give this book to Mr. Peng first.

532
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,800
Maybe you can pass it on

533
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,100
no intention of quitting school

534
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,900
Every library can find it

535
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,400
Then what do I think the characteristics of this book are?

536
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,100
What about the typhoon it introduced?

537
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,800
In fact there are scientific issues

538
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,900
So our topic today starts from this

539
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,500
I put the inspiration for translating this book

540
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,400
it has many scientific issues

541
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,100
But it is also mixed with a lot of humanities

542
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,200
historical and artistic

543
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,400
so i think it's very interesting

544
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,000
It's worth it when you have time

545
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
can read

546
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
as if i just mentioned here

547
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
The topic of our speech today

548
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
it has a typhoon with a historical view

549
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
typhoon with scientific dimension

550
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
even literary level

551
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I hope this book can give you a

552
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
more complete different aspects

553
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
this is a scientific question

554
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
can i quote today

555
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
In fact, our domestic

556
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I saw it in today's early starters

557
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Mr. Zhu, are you here today?

558
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Are you in the Humanities or History Institute?

559
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Mr. Zhu Malone

560
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Today is good

561
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
i saw his name

562
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
in Taiwan University

563
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
a few years ago about ten years ago

564
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I have read a history department

565
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
student research essay

566
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Just researching how the typhoon got its name

567
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
did very very detailed

568
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
analysis of research

569
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
In the book I introduced today

570
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
He also has a question about how the typhoon came

571
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,740
There are some analyzes on how the hurricanes in the United States come from

572
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,000
what about in cuba

573
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,740
they were in the caribbean a long time ago

574
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,340
I knew there was such a phenomenon as a hurricane.

575
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,040
In fact they have some mythical stories

576
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,240
to describe the source of these storms

577
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,200
In fact this of our hurricane

578
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,540
What about the word Hurricane?

579
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,640
In fact, it's from these guys over there

580
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,340
including from their Inca culture

581
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,540
All the way to the culture of the Caribbean

582
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,240
there is such wisdom

583
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,640
to describe this horrible god of evil

584
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,240
Then there is such a stone totem

585
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,840
They were all found out later

586
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,740
that they think they

587
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,840
This is the storm god they saw

588
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,840
It's amazing what people of later generations are thinking about saying

589
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,640
The typhoon they drew at the beginning rotated

590
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,840
The direction of the shaft back is already correct.

591
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
Is it a coincidence?

592
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,240
Or are they already available from this one

593
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,940
The direction of this number of five texts that was blown down

594
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
But the characteristic that the wind is rotating counterclockwise in the whole northern hemisphere

595
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Then the typhoon symbol in the scientific world of our modern standard is consistent with this, and it is drawn like this

596
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Another very interesting story related to our East is

597
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
In fact, these storms are also changing history

598
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:35,000
In 1274 AD, it was in Lake Bilie, and at that time the Mongols were considered their kings or emperors

599
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
After he has unified the entire country of China

600
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
His ambition gradually shifted to wanting to continue to conquer other countries including Japan

601
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So in 1274, this Hu Bilie sent his army to combine with the conquered Korea at that time

602
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
There is a joint army composed of the Han army, Mongolian army and North Korea

603
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,300
an army of one hundred thousand

604
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,900
At that time, it was already an incredible army

605
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,800
Attack Japan with thousands of these warships

606
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,200
Then they go directly to the Kyushu area, of course the first line

607
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,300
What about this ship? It's almost a success.

608
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,700
They all beat Japan

609
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,000
The Japanese are losing ground

610
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,000
That's because the Mongolian army didn't dare to enter too quickly

611
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,800
So most of the troops stay on the ship

612
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,840
The result is at this time

613
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,640
They encountered a miraculous cleansing of a typhoon

614
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,940
completely annihilated

615
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,840
The Japanese put this one

616
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,040
What about the history of this one?

617
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,440
this one that caused this one

618
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,840
become a giant wind

619
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,980
The original meaning of Kamikaze Nahara in Japan is called

620
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,140
Kamakaze means Kamikaze

621
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,240
In 1281, the same history repeated itself

622
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,640
Later, the original army was attacking Japan

623
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,640
But in the same situation

624
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,140
What about this period of history in Japan?

625
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,800
There are very detailed records in Japanese books

626
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,900
in 1281

627
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,400
There is a professor at Merchant Marine University in Tokyo, Japan

628
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,500
he based on these histories

629
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,000
with modern technology

630
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,400
Sheng Na and so on

631
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,700
To this open sea of ​​Kyushu

632
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,500
Yin Island and so on, some Yin Yin Yin Yin

633
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,500
the vicinity of these islands

634
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,100
To do some biological exploration of the seabed

635
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,600
Including later this unprecedented one

636
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,400
vehicle down detection

637
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,300
I found many of these

638
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,300
At the beginning, this Mongolia or reinforcements

639
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,400
what they left behind

640
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,900
Weapons and some property, etc.

641
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,000
That also indirectly confirms this period of history

642
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,600
So this typhoon also changed history

643
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,200
Without these two or several

644
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,100
The impact of the magical typhoon

645
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,500
Maybe Japan has changed

646
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,100
I don't know what it's like now

647
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,200
History

648
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,600
What about the development?

649
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,800
that in this one

650
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,300
this hair

651
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,800
this of course

652
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,900
What about this kamikaze?

653
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,500
By the time of World War II

654
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,000
This term is of course inspired by Japan

655
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,900
to some extent as

656
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,300
a metaphor for them

657
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,600
as a symbol of their patriotism

658
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,900
unfortunately

659
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,700
organized the so-called kamikaze

660
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,200
come from the same noun

661
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,600
that's unfortunate of course

662
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,300
Many young people were patriotic

663
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,900
sacrificed their lives

664
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,600
So the word kamikaze

665
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,900
Later it was tantamount to being misused

666
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,500
or to be quoted

667
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
In World War II became

668
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,700
symbol of kamikaze

669
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,300
when i was raw

670
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,300
Indeed there is such a

671
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,400
Nature's arrangement just protects

672
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,700
Japan at that time

673
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,900
well here is a brief history

674
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,300
An introduction to typhoons

675
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,600
Then I introduced it in the nutrition section.

676
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,800
the poem of the poem

677
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,000
Of course three to four to one

678
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
He may not have personally met the so-called Hurricane

679
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
when i dined like today

680
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Teacher Liang, a colleague asked me

681
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Why there are no typhoons in Europe

682
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Then of course I can add more to you later.

683
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Basically the only place where a typhoon has a chance to form

684
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
in the warmer waters of the tropics

685
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So whether in the Atlantic or the Pacific

686
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
After these hurricanes formed

687
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Just in these tropical regions are in the so-called envelope belt

688
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Take him in Dongfeng and move west

689
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So he has no chance to go north

690
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Or go northeast to Europe

691
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So there is no typhoon in Europe

692
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So Shakespeare itself certainly didn't

693
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Experienced a real Hurricane

694
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But in this UK or off the coast of Europe

695
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It could also be that there are a lot of storms

696
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
these may be winter storms

697
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
not a summer storm

698
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
the more different its physical properties

699
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,840
Written in these famous classics of their history

700
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,200
They also take this so-called power of nature

701
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,520
This horrific situation with this torrential rain force

702
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,340
described very very vividly

703
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,200
If you are interested, you can read the Chinese and English parts separately.

704
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,760
Or the Chinese part we translated

705
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,560
trying to experience

706
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,620
Then today I will probably do a very simple one.

707
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,680
an introduction

708
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,980
what about this end of america

709
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,560
That's another famous poet I also visited

710
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,360
he commemorates him

711
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,180
The place where he was born because he is in Ma Chau

712
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,020
Then this one Emily Dickinson wrote this song

713
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,140
This poem is also very beautiful and talks about the wind and rain

714
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,420
water etc.

715
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,700
I just happen to

716
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,080
After this translation, I cooperated with one of my juniors last year and now it has become a song

717
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,620
Maybe those who are interested, I can broadcast it to everyone in the future

718
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,820
Ok, let's go back to Typhoon

719
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,920
We are influencing what is going to happen in our Taiwan today

720
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,980
What about the Sura typhoon we just talked about?

721
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,320
Some newspapers you may have heard say

722
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,120
Everyone is worrying about it's so-called dot

723
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,440
Possibly a Northwest station

724
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,720
If you notice the news

725
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,280
You may have heard the term

726
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,860
Let me explain to you what Northwest TV is doing.

727
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:31,500
In 1996, there was a typhoon cleaning Taiwan called Hebo Typhoon

728
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,300
If anyone here has any impression, please raise your hand

729
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,920
Not bad, it seems that everyone is also deeply affected by it

730
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:45,580
This typhoon landed in Keelung from the northern part of Taiwan and then left Taiwan.

731
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,100
But what?

732
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,940
It was the strongest typhoon in those years

733
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,780
that's what we're doing

734
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,900
On the Taipei Line, there is another mine stall on the top of Wufen Mountain in New Taipei City.

735
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
The original scene

736
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
This radar is very telling

737
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
because the whole radar

738
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The so-called modern radar

739
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Setup in Taiwan

740
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
this is the first

741
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
is the highest technology

742
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
The modern one is called Duppler's

743
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
new radar

744
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
it can detect

745
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
distribution of rainfall

746
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
and typhoon wind

747
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
indirect estimate

748
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Doppler effect

749
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
wind speed can be estimated

750
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
This radar in 1996's

751
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Set on July 23

752
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
original design

753
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It can tolerate winds of 65 meters per second

754
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
it is well designed

755
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
only a week

756
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
July 30-31, 1996

757
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Typhoon Herb directly

758
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
center passes nearby

759
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
The result is very accurate

760
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
This typhoon is as high as every second

761
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
70 meters

762
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
very precise

763
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
This radar is destroyed

764
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
this is also

765
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
karma

766
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Our Nature Benefits

767
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
like know what we're doing detection

768
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Of course it took another year to rebuild

769
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
well that's an interesting story

770
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
But the point of this typhoon is that this typhoon passes by like this

771
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
The wind of the typhoon revolves counterclockwise

772
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So in Taiwan when he was close to Taiwan and still here

773
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
The place where Taiwan's fresh water exits is blowing

774
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
probably northerly to northwesterly

775
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
So he will block the flooding of our freshwater river

776
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
The Danshui River is collected from the Xindian Creek Keelung River

777
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
The only exit with the Great Khan Creek

778
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So his whole water is accumulated

779
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
and then add the metropolitan area rainfall

780
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
so the whole place is flooded

781
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
so in taipei

782
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
For example, the setting island in Taipei City, etc.

783
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Both sides of this West River are completely flooded

784
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
very severe flooding

785
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Then this situation becomes Northwest TV

786
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So Northwest TV should refer to

787
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Only typhoons pass by here to bring this water

788
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,960
When the northwest wind blows in the northwest corner of Taiwan

789
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,160
this typhoon

790
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,760
Then this kind of typhoon will easily cause relatively severe disasters in our Taipei county and city

791
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,440
Our typhoon this time is coming from here

792
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,400
But it may slowly turn around like this

793
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,800
So have features like

794
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,640
So we need to be more cautious in our northern places

795
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,320
Well, this is called Xibeitan

796
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,440
then i won't repeat it

797
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440
I will introduce a few terms to you today

798
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,040
Another one that everyone still remembers is Typhoon Nali 10 years ago in 2001

799
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,160
What is special about this typhoon is

800
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,840
it's already in september

801
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,200
At this time, the sea temperature is already relatively low.

802
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,600
It stands to reason that typhoons are less likely to stay in the same place for too long

803
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:53,360
But it brushed down from the northeast with a very peculiar trajectory

804
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,840
Took 49 hours to pass through Taiwan

805
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,960
very slow

806
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,040
that would cause a lot of accumulated rainfall

807
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,560
because it moved for a long time

808
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,540
raining

809
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,920
It rains all the time, but the ocean continuously provides water vapor for the typhoon to turn into rainfall

810
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:11,000
So we have a lot of rain here, especially in the metropolitan Taipei area

811
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,340
You all know that it caused a serious incident at that time.

812
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,620
Situation of stagnant water

813
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,760
Let me tell you about another type of typhoon called Morakot.

814
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,300
this typhoon

815
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,860
happened three years ago

816
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,440
He himself caused the so-called baba flood

817
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,480
His wind is not very strong

818
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,320
He's just a basic moderate typhoon

819
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,920
But he moved very slowly before he passed Taiwan

820
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,200
plus

821
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,480
what about this season

822
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,060
He is in early August, July to August

823
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,360
We happen to be in the whole of Asia

824
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,460
When the southwest monsoon prevails and intensifies

825
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,020
What about this strong monsoon?

826
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,120
This place in the South China Sea is very humid and warm air brings up

827
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,920
Although the typhoon is

828
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,880
On the east side of Taiwan, the warm and humid air brought up by the southwest airflow

829
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,280
Will be affected by typhoon and terrain

830
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,340
will cause a lot of rain in the southwestern part of Taiwan

831
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,800
When this pattern and this form appear

832
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,200
In the southwest but not in the center of the typhoon

833
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,920
while in the southwestern plains and mountainous areas there is a lot of rainfall

834
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:29,000
That caused a very serious so-called bus storm disaster

835
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,160
Morakot's Storm has another feature

836
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,400
It's the role of the southwest airflow that I just mentioned.

837
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:41,560
From now on, we now understand everyone's understanding of the entire typhoon prevention

838
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,000
it's a little more complicated

839
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,800
In addition to considering the changes in the wind and rain of the typhoon itself

840
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,440
Also consider our larger scope

841
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,480
The role of the incoming southwesterly gusts over hundreds of kilometers

842
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,440
When the airflow is strong

843
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,640
is possible

844
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
may have additional effects

845
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Of course, the impact will be more serious in the southwestern part of Taiwan.

846
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Another thing to mention here is that

847
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
What about this particular case of our Morakot?

848
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
let's take a look

849
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
This is the storage capacity of two reservoirs in southwestern Taiwan

850
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
They are Wushantou Reservoir and Zhenwen Reservoir respectively.

851
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
The two reservoirs were counted from January 2009

852
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Everyone sees that the water is getting less and less

853
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Because there was very little rain in the whole spring that year.

854
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So getting dry is its benefit

855
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
By June and July of that year, the water volume had reached

856
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Compared with the so-called water shortage situation

857
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
But a typhoon came on August 8

858
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
dramatic increase in water

859
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Just because of the cleaning of Typhoon Morakot

860
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Then what

861
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
excess water

862
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
But what about after the water caused the flood?

863
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
It quickly lost to the sea again

864
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So the reservoir can't hold so much water

865
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So then suddenly the drought came next door

866
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Every other year until another new typhoon comes

867
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
There is water in the reservoir

868
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So the arrangement of our reservoir in Taiwan

869
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
In fact, it has a lot to do with how to grasp the dynamics of the typhoon

870
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
The reservoir wants to keep the water a little more

871
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
But I'm afraid it will burst again

872
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
If it drains water when the typhoon is strongest

873
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
The disaster will be more serious

874
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
So this is a very big learning

875
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
This is why we in Taiwan are suffering from this drought

876
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Alternate process of water shortage or flood

877
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Part of the reason it's very difficult

878
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I just mentioned that typhoon Morakot will cause such a large amount of precipitation

879
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
partly caused by accumulated precipitation

880
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
because it moves very slowly as it passes

881
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
In a slow process, it can continue to rain

882
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It's been a long time

883
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
This process is also closely related to the topography of Taiwan.

884
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,440
Main file of Taiwan terrain

885
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,840
You can imagine our terrain itself

886
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,640
about three kilometers high

887
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,440
There are even places close to four kilometers

888
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,260
Under the main file of this high mountain in Taiwan

889
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:15,120
Although the development of the vertical airflow of the typhoon itself

890
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,380
range of rotation possible

891
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,940
up to a height of ten kilometers

892
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,520
But its strongest part is within a few kilometers of the lower floors

893
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,120
I just received a word from Shan’s main file at this place

894
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,400
the airflow will change

895
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,400
Then we can't flow to

896
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,760
land inside

897
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,780
it will be blocked

898
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,640
Then we can see that the terrain is actually changing the state of the typhoon's movement

899
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,740
So if we want to make more accurate typhoon predictions

900
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,580
It may be necessary to have a better understanding of how terrain affects typhoons

901
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,700
This is also one of the reasons why it is more difficult for us to predict typhoons

902
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,760
What about the last example?

903
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,000
just mentioned

904
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,880
Many people have raised their hands to affect this in an event in Shuo

905
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,120
Meiji Typhoon

906
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,800
You may also know when this typhoon occurs

907
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,800
it's raining a lot here

908
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,300
Especially in the Shuao area

909
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,800
But where is the typhoon?

910
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,800
Do you have any impression

911
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,300
where was the typhoon at that time

912
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,400
When Typhoon Maegi occurred

913
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,600
Typhoon Meiji is not in Taiwan at all

914
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,900
He is over the South China Sea

915
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,100
he passed the philippines

916
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,500
He is so far away

917
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,200
we call it a

918
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,900
Typical effect called Qiutai

919
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,200
Everyone, if we see you again this fall

920
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,500
When a typhoon approaches us

921
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,000
Notice if the term is mentioned

922
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
in autumn

923
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Typhoons sometimes go very low

924
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,900
in the South China Sea

925
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,700
You can see that they are all in this area

926
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,000
are near the South China Sea

927
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,700
But Taiwan is raining

928
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,100
how so

929
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,600
then there is one

930
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,100
I'm on this topic

931
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,600
There are also some research results

932
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,200
Then I made a schematic diagram like this

933
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200
typhoon though

934
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,600
In the South China Sea, but its airflow is like this

935
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,320
It just started with autumn and the low atmosphere

936
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,560
The atmosphere below about 1500 meters has the northeast monsoon

937
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,040
start to strengthen

938
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,520
because we know autumn is coming

939
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,560
Gradually the northeast monsoon

940
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,600
Then their two winds will meet here

941
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,320
will be on the east side of Taiwan to the northeast corner

942
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,560
form this conforming airflow

943
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,080
Then the corresponding airflow will rise if it is blocked by the mountain

944
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,080
that would result in the so-called

945
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,680
easy to produce more rainfall

946
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,760
So the rain falls on the east side of Taiwan

947
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,840
What about this effect?

948
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,880
Some people call it the co-hosting effect

949
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,520
refers to the swirling airflow of a typhoon

950
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,280
with northeast monsoon

951
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,960
an effect of co-existence

952
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,160
Then this effect happens in autumn

953
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,920
So what we call the Qiutai effect

954
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,400
There are often typhoons far away from us in autumn

955
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,120
caused major disasters in Taiwan

956
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,000
Just like the typhoon over there

957
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Then I spent 30 minutes briefly introducing many basic characteristics of typhoons to everyone.

958
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Then in the last paragraph of the first stage today, I will tell you that the problem of typhoon is not just the typhoon itself.

959
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Now a topic that many people in the scientific community are concerned about is that if our climate changes

960
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Will our typhoon-like storms change accordingly?

961
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
How is typhoon related to climate?

962
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Then I will use a few simple slides to report some progress in this regard

963
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Then this is a picture that you may be more familiar with.

964
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It's too much to talk about is that this is all the temperature observations we have all over the world

965
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
An average of observations of the Earth's surface temperature

966
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
We see that from the last century all the way to our past

967
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,760
temperature over the past few years

968
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,120
Characteristics of changes in global mean surface temperature

969
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,260
Then we obviously see

970
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,620
It's a well-known feature

971
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,120
is talking about

972
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,620
The phenomenon of global warming that we have experienced in the last hundred years

973
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,820
to the past hundred years or so

974
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,120
Our global surface temperature has increased

975
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,420
about 0.74 degrees

976
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,420
that doesn't seem like much

977
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,000
because we go from morning to night

978
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,620
In winter, the weather changes by more than ten degrees.

979
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,620
So why should we worry about this 0.74 degree?

980
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:37,620
Because this 0.74 is a global average

981
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,620
You want the global average to be

982
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,620
To increase there is a systematic increase so much

983
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:46,620
Indicates that our climate is changing

984
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,620
Then this is not a completely negligible data

985
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,620
Then this obvious change

986
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,620
That's what everyone cares about right now

987
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,620
global warming issue

988
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:00,620
So what are the reasons for this phenomenon?

989
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,700
That might be another speech to talk about

990
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,500
For example, the birth effect, the human-induced birth effect, etc.

991
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,000
So what we're going to talk about today is

992
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,500
under such a condition

993
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:17,000
Scientists or scholars who we are very concerned about social economy will come out

994
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,500
Our Future Affects Our Rainfall

995
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,300
and storm system

996
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,000
Will there be systemic changes as well?

997
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,500
He will also be characteristically different

998
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,000
then to understand the problem

999
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,500
especially the typhoon

1000
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,500
We're going to start with the most basic research

1001
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,000
This research is very basic

1002
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
show us some clues

1003
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,500
what eyebrows

1004
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:48,000
This is a very well-known research scholar

1005
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
When he puts the world's typhoons at their strongest

1006
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
how strong is he

1007
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Compared with the sea temperature conditions at that time

1008
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
as a study of every point

1009
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:07,900
Under certain conditions, there is a typhoon whose intensity reaches 40 meters, etc.

1010
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,900
He just clicked out every point, so many points

1011
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:18,800
There are the North Atlantic Ocean and the Northeast Pacific Ocean respectively, which are near the coast of Mexico

1012
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,800
And the Pacific Ocean in the Northwest is near us

1013
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,800
All points find a common feature

1014
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:33,800
This common feature is that we found that if the sea temperature is higher,

1015
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:41,800
The lowest distribution of typhoon is still so low, but the maximum value of the strongest and strongest part is getting bigger and bigger

1016
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:46,800
In other words, roughly one of the properties of an observation that appears to be

1017
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:53,800
As long as the sea temperature is relatively high, the range where the typhoon may reach the strongest intensity will be relatively strong

1018
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:58,800
Just like the cover given by this red line

1019
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,800
Vertices are getting bigger and bigger

1020
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,960
But what about individual typhoons?

1021
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,120
big and small

1022
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,560
incomparably larger

1023
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,720
But its strongest is bigger

1024
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,400
so its average

1025
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,120
will go up a bit

1026
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,360
Average typhoon from here to here

1027
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,040
about this strong

1028
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,720
But the average from here to here

1029
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,600
Average values ​​at this sea temperature are here

1030
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,720
So basically it's telling us

1031
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,920
when we have global warming

1032
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,280
higher sea temperature

1033
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,480
may offer more favorable conditions

1034
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,720
Give the typhoon a chance to be stronger

1035
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,000
But of course there are a few typhoons

1036
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,560
For different reasons the comparison is not very strong

1037
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,560
that's possible

1038
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,480
But its statistical average properties

1039
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,360
will be stronger

1040
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,960
What about this feature?

1041
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,120
a few years ago

1042
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,840
There is a very well-known research unit

1043
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:49,840
That

1044
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,760
I just happened to serve in this research unit in the past

1045
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,040
called Princeton University

1046
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,840
geodynamics

1047
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,360
Fluid Power Laboratory

1048
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,160
they use computers

1049
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
to simulate this feature

1050
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,320
This characteristic is to say

1051
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,520
in a modern climate

1052
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,960
The distribution of typhoon intensity is roughly like this

1053
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,920
Then here is the central air pressure of the typhoon

1054
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,120
That is the number of typhoon occurrences

1055
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,240
In other words

1056
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,320
If the line moves west and left,

1057
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,240
The lower the central air pressure, the stronger the typhoon

1058
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,400
So here is the frequency distribution plot of the past distribution

1059
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,960
So this is the later, rougher time limit?

1060
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,440
is talking

1061
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,360
100 years later

1062
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,240
If our planet's carbon dioxide doubled

1063
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,480
After that doubled

1064
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,480
Global temperatures could increase by a few degrees C after

1065
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,040
new climate line

1066
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,800
The typhoon that their computer sees

1067
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,680
The distribution of the activities of the situation

1068
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,840
Then the entire line moves to the left on average.

1069
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:56,320
That means it does change in average strength

1070
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,280
more obvious

1071
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,920
So what was asked above

1072
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
As for this question, their answer is yes, it will be stronger

1073
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
But I added a butt

1074
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,000
We also see that this total area represents the total number of typhoons

1075
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
but slightly reduced

1076
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,000
In other words, we have more strong typhoons around the world

1077
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
But the total number of typhoons has decreased

1078
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
In other words

1079
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Smaller and weaker typhoons are also less and more

1080
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:39,000
That is to say, the whole world concentrates the main energy in a specific relatively strong typhoon.

1081
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Such changes can indeed have an impact on our lives and our environment

1082
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:52,000
This feature is our climate system

1083
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
After warming, it is possible to create more strong typhoons

1084
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Then this one is the result of a single study

1085
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
currently published

1086
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
However, in recent years there have been more new results

1087
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Both reflect similar consistent features

1088
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
This feature refers to the

1089
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
The future is actually not just typhoons

1090
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
under the new climate

1091
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
warmer

1092
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Under this global warming climate pattern

1093
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Our storms may also be stronger

1094
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
but at the same time

1095
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
drought in places where water is scarce

1096
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
That is, our climate is extreme.

1097
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Then this is the result of what we call polarization

1098
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Of course it belongs to

1099
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Make our climate important to our survival

1100
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
In fact there are larger

1101
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Threats and challenges exist

1102
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So far this issue

1103
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
still under study

1104
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
is what we are currently engaged in

1105
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
A Hot Topic in Atmospheric Research

1106
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
what i just said

1107
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
slightly simpler

1108
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
In fact, there are many details

1109
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
there are still some uncertainties

1110
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
There are also some scientists who have many

1111
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,300
Different theories and different views

1112
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,640
Then these have to be clarified with updated research.

1113
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,700
But I think the concept I'm talking about so far is roughly

1114
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,500
It's acceptable, you can take him

1115
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,040
take home

1116
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,600
what about this question

1117
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:20,220
A few years ago the World Meteorological Organization of the United Nations convened many scientists

1118
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,500
meeting together

1119
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:28,160
Then I happened to participate in this conference, which was quite interesting at the end of 2006.

1120
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,480
Meeting in Costa Rica, singing poems and leaving home

1121
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,760
That

1122
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,580
then i will go to this country for a meeting

1123
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,660
The happiest and most gratifying thing

1124
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,220
The first visa-free because it is a country with diplomatic relations with us

1125
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:48,900
The second is the holiday between us to visit his national park is the National Park of the Living Mountain

1126
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,720
You may not believe it

1127
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,040
There are only two flags in the entire national park

1128
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,340
One is the national flag of Geshi Dalijia and Dalijia

1129
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,300
The national flag of the Republic of China is all over the mountain

1130
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,580
why

1131
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:06,920
Because that national park belongs to Renyang of the Republic of China

1132
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,720
But it's a very, very positive thing

1133
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,780
So it's also gratifying

1134
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,060
but

1135
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,120
What I want to apologize to everyone is that we broke up the next year.

1136
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:16,900
so

1137
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,440
I haven't been back yet

1138
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,720
but anyway

1139
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,500
what about this meeting

1140
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,120
Basically, I made a few conclusions, saying that this issue is very, very important.

1141
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,160
but there are some

1142
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,460
some places we're not sure yet

1143
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,000
is it right

1144
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,040
more research needed

1145
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,600
what is the future

1146
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,660
under new climate conditions

1147
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,000
Those of us who create natural disasters with severe weather like typhoons

1148
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,040
or good rain

1149
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,600
How to change systematically

1150
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,380
more research is needed

1151
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,180
that many

1152
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,240
Scientists are still working on this

1153
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:58,560
Well, another interesting topic I mentioned at the beginning is typhoons.

1154
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
A symbiosis with the ocean

1155
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
There is no typhoon without ocean

1156
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Typhoons are only produced on warm oceans

1157
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Obviously the ocean is a very important player

1158
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Among our many scientists

1159
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Some research results that have only been discovered in the past few decades

1160
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
discovered that the ocean provides powerful conditions

1161
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
let the typhoon develop

1162
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
But our typhoon is also very interesting

1163
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Typhoons also affect the ocean

1164
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Because the wind of the typhoon blows on the sea

1165
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Give the ocean very strong this we say kerrik

1166
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
will blow the ocean

1167
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
because the ocean moves too

1168
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
This move will flip the ocean

1169
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
makes the ocean

1170
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
We know the ocean temperature is structured like this

1171
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
The temperature is getting colder as we go down

1172
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
there's a place on the surface of the ocean that we call the mixed layer

1173
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
About tens of meters above the surface of the ocean

1174
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Up to a range of 100 meters at most?

1175
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,160
These places have higher temperatures

1176
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,160
Then there's the cold sea water

1177
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,160
cold all the way to the bottom of the sea

1178
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,060
The water on the surface of our oceans may have

1179
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:12,060
For example, the temperature of 27, 28 degrees

1180
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,900
But it's only 20 degrees below 100 meters

1181
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:19,720
when the typhoon blows across the ocean

1182
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,320
the ocean will turn

1183
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,320
That's because of the wind

1184
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,120
The sea caused by this typhoon

1185
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,960
Up and down exchange of upper seawater

1186
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,460
This process of mixing corners

1187
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,460
will bring the cold sea water up

1188
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,460
After the typhoon cools down

1189
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,460
maybe a few degrees

1190
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,460
Then the sea temperature that was originally favorable for the development of typhoons

1191
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,460
not enough

1192
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,460
after not enough

1193
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,460
The typhoon will weaken or even dissipate

1194
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,460
Then you can see this example

1195
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:51,960
This is a typhoon that happened in 2001

1196
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,960
That typhoon is called Typhoon Billis.

1197
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,460
Maybe you are not familiar with

1198
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,460
But this typhoon is very interesting

1199
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,460
Our first in Taiwan

1200
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,640
The second one, just mentioned the first modernized radar was on July 23, 1996

1201
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:09,720
The second one was set in July 2001

1202
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,540
The one located on Green Island

1203
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,620
After that radar is set up,

1204
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,160
less than a month

1205
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:22,020
I have experienced it, experienced the strongest new typhoon in that era

1206
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,060
directly across from Green Island

1207
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:27,400
Very amazing, this is not something that can be explained by science

1208
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,380
That

1209
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,920
After this one passed through, everyone saw that he just passed through Green Island

1210
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,000
The radar is back

1211
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,060
It took a year to rebuild

1212
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:36,820
But

1213
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:42,040
After reconstruction, it was rebuilt with the same standard, and no typhoon of the same intensity has passed by until now.

1214
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,000
survived until now

1215
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,040
It's just unfortunate that he

1216
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,100
He has a design limit

1217
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:53,200
Because the cost of designing a radar that can withstand stronger winds is much higher

1218
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,400
So he designed to say this

1219
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,280
should

1220
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:59,180
There is a small chance that a typhoon will pass by

1221
00:57:59,440 --> 00:57:59,960
It turned out just right

1222
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,440
They were all encountered within a month of completion.

1223
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,040
But it's been fine since then

1224
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,840
This typhoon is back

1225
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,840
Before the typhoon passed by, he did not reach Taiwan

1226
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,280
Please tell us about the satellite data

1227
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,840
The temperature of the water on the east side of his typhoon passing by

1228
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,040
massive reduction

1229
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,840
What is the extent of this reduction?

1230
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,600
Basically can reach 4 to 5 degrees

1231
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,680
So the whole sea is cold

1232
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,800
Then the typhoon will weaken slightly once he cools down

1233
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,200
In other words

1234
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,400
We the ocean are playing for us

1235
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,600
A machine of nature that adjusts the intensity of typhoons

1236
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,640
The ocean automatically tells the typhoon to brake

1237
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,880
On the one hand, the ocean provides energy to make the typhoon grow

1238
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,040
But when the typhoon rises to a certain level

1239
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,120
The effect of this cold water of the ocean

1240
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,960
I will tell the typhoon to speak slowly

1241
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,480
don't get stronger

1242
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,200
Then this function is also a very interesting

1243
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,640
Scientific question

1244
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,320
What if this effect is not well understood?

1245
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,120
It is difficult for you to predict how strong the typhoon will develop

1246
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,000
That's us too, but our ocean observation data is relatively limited.

1247
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Therefore, our prediction of the intensity of the typhoon is also affected by this ocean factor.

1248
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I have a colleague who has done a really good job with this research on colleagues

1249
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I have a joint research with him

1250
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
What about my colleague, Teacher Lin Yiyi?

1251
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
He also noted that he used a large number of satellite observations

1252
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,000
can tell where the ocean is warmer and thicker

1253
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,000
If the temperature of the ocean is thicker, the ocean is thicker

1254
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
The typhoon has less disturbance to it

1255
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Because the cold sea water cannot come up in the deep place

1256
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Under such ocean conditions, the typhoon may become very strong.

1257
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
So this one example here is telling us that the ocean

1258
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Some places are very warm and thick, some places are colder

1259
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
red is warm

1260
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
since 2003

1261
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,400
There is a typhoon causing serious disaster in Busan, South Korea

1262
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,000
It was developed to the strongest stage

1263
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,200
when passing through this area

1264
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,400
in the pacific

1265
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,200
Just passed a very, very warm warm water

1266
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,400
the warm zone we call the ocean

1267
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,000
Teacher Lin Yiyi noticed that

1268
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,200
This typhoon called MIMI

1269
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,600
Typhoon MIMI is passing through this area

1270
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,000
It's as strong as a triple jump

1271
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,600
It changed from a typhoon of the first category to a second category

1272
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,000
Change the third level, the fourth level, to the fifth level yellow

1273
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,800
it just passes through this area

1274
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,200
Because the ocean is thick enough

1275
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,200
So that natural restriction can't happen

1276
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,400
Because the warm water is blocked very below

1277
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,600
In the deep sea below 100 meters

1278
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,800
so it grows

1279
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,400
This particle happens to be a few years later

1280
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,000
There is a very good proof

1281
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,600
This proof happened in 2005

1282
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,600
very different

1283
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,400
one in the south of america

1284
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,900
everyone is familiar with

1285
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,700
This is the giant peak called Catalina

1286
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,900
This giant peak first landed

1287
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,500
This New Europe-faced area

1288
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,900
caused thousands of casualties

1289
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:19,100
This giant peak is also God's will

1290
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:20,100
really unfortunate

1291
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,900
When this giant peak just passed by here

1292
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:25,900
It was originally just a second-level giant peak.

1293
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:29,500
But just in this season

1294
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,800
America has an ocean current

1295
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,600
This ocean current we call lasing current

1296
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:38,400
The larger scope of this set of flow is from this side

1297
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,800
Then on the Cuban side will pass here

1298
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:46,700
up through the east side of florida

1299
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,900
This current is called the Mexican Pill Current

1300
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,500
that is a warm current

1301
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,800
warm current from the south

1302
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,900
This warm current in this Atlantic Ocean

1303
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:57,800
usually flow like this

1304
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,900
But this warm current has an instability

1305
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,160
occasionally twists out

1306
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,600
and will come out

1307
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,600
Sleeve flow

1308
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,000
it becomes a loop

1309
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,360
Our Chinese translation complete flow

1310
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:14,400
just at that time it came out

1311
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,460
It's like Mazu went around

1312
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,360
around the gulf of mexico

1313
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,960
would have been gulf of mexico

1314
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,900
The sea water of this bay

1315
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:25,460
is very very shallow mixed layer

1316
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:26,700
That is to say

1317
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:27,900
the water is cold under it

1318
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,800
easy to run up to

1319
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,700
So most typhoons pass through the Gulf of Mexico

1320
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,160
weakens soon

1321
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,360
But that time I just met this warm cow passing by

1322
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:40,600
So this typhoon is blessed here

1323
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,700
The result of this blessing

1324
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:45,160
it goes from level two to level five

1325
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,800
Just leave this warm cow when you are at your strongest

1326
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,760
then slowly fades away

1327
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,760
But it landed at level 4

1328
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,900
Originally the United States designed this one

1329
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:58,300
Time to watch out for this one in New Orleans Beachview

1330
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:59,860
It is designed to resist...

1331
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,280
Category 3 hurricane

1332
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:05,120
Mainly because the hurricane in this place can't be that strong

1333
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,400
will weaken

1334
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,960
But that year happened to encounter this warm current

1335
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,500
So the ocean is so important

1336
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,540
Of course this unfortunate

1337
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,640
This accident is the match of fate

1338
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,720
In addition to the excavation in the New European Union area

1339
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:23,040
Then we must rely on this precaution to protect

1340
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,120
But watch out for the last three places where the embankment breaks

1341
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:29,440
So the whole city is buried under the flood

1342
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,820
on our east coast

1343
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,120
In fact there is a similar one

1344
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,140
characteristic ocean currents

1345
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,180
This ocean current we all know is

1346
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:38,960
our black grass

1347
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,540
This black grass is passing through the east side of Taiwan to the north

1348
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,060
but

1349
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,100
What about his organization?

1350
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:45,620
main

1351
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,400
It is obvious here that in this area

1352
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,960
What about the black grass?

1353
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,240
right now we

1354
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,080
It is suspected that Typhoon Nali was around here in the first place.

1355
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,160
This one Nali can be here in September

1356
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,960
Survival last affects Taiwan

1357
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,200
It may be closely related to passing through the black grass

1358
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,900
So if we want to understand typhoons

1359
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Not only the atmosphere but also the ocean

1360
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:10,700
Both must pass

1361
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,400
may be more precise

1362
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,700
Can judge how it will develop in the future

1363
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,800
even predict it

1364
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,200
those are some examples

1365
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,100
Then at the end of today, I will introduce to you

1366
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,100
How can we use the modern scientific method

1367
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,500
to enhance our understanding of the issue

1368
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:30,500
Ok, the last question for today's first period

1369
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,500
Many people must want to ask

1370
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,500
Can a typhoon be reformed?

1371
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:36,500
how

1372
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,500
You may have heard many such sayings.

1373
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,500
that in fact we are in

1374
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,500
National Geographic Discovery

1375
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,500
There are topics discussing whether the typhoon can be transformed

1376
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,500
Is the answer Yes or No?

1377
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:59,500
I wrote an article for Scientist magazine in 2006

1378
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
talk about this

1379
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,040
In simple terms

1380
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,700
yes there are many different ideas

1381
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,000
Some of these ideas

1382
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,540
scientifically based

1383
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,540
Most of them have scientific basis

1384
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:13,800
But in essence

1385
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,300
It's something that our human technology can't do at present.

1386
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,940
So I listed him as a little bit

1387
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:20,340
close to sci-fi

1388
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,040
But it's a good idea

1389
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:25,100
let me talk to you

1390
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:26,400
You can go back and think about it

1391
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,940
do you have any ideas

1392
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:28,640
what to do

1393
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,640
change typhoon

1394
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:33,980
In America since the 1960s

1395
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:36,180
From 1980 to 20 years

1396
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,980
proposed an idea

1397
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,940
A large research project called

1398
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:41,140
Broken plan

1399
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,480
Broken Wind Project

1400
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,480
What about this shattering plan?

1401
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:48,040
It was proposed by a group of excellent scientists

1402
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,540
their idea is to say

1403
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,680
What if we can be around the typhoon?

1404
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:55,240
to do artificial rainfall

1405
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,280
artificial rain

1406
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,480
Just sprinkle some chemical camp and so on

1407
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,160
Let the typhoon around

1408
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,720
The atmosphere condenses and rains at the periphery of the typhoon in advance

1409
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,480
After the typhoon came in, the water vapor condensed outside ahead of time

1410
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,080
The eyewall inside the typhoon was wiped out.

1411
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,840
Or we say being chocked

1412
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,120
suffocated

1413
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,440
it has no water vapor

1414
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,560
it will dissipate

1415
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:24,360
If the main winds of the typhoon are all turning outside

1416
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,880
like an ice skater he was spinning really fast

1417
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,520
when he opened his hand

1418
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,520
Because of the conservation of absolute foot momentum

1419
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,160
The speed of his entire rotation slows down.

1420
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:37,200
The idea is entirely based on physics

1421
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,760
But they have been flying planes for more than ten years

1422
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,880
I went into the typhoon and sprinkled a lot of these phones

1423
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,920
This so-called agglomeration

1424
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,880
to help the typhoon rain on the periphery

1425
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:53,120
Finally, analyze the result

1426
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,520
to the early 1980s

1427
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:59,720
The United States finally invited a very famous scientist

1428
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,320
Zhu Zhiying

1429
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,460
Made a committee to see if it worked after all

1430
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:07,280
As a result, the research report showed that

1431
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,700
they can't prove

1432
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,880
with or without home

1433
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,480
Does the strength of the typhoon affect

1434
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,620
So that project ended up being discontinued.

1435
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:19,680
Then this idea will stay in this city forever

1436
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,480
because we want to be efficient

1437
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,380
with limited aircraft resources

1438
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:28,320
To transform the entire radius of hundreds of kilometers

1439
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,960
Typhoon rainfall in a large environment

1440
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,660
Actually that cost a lot

1441
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:37,120
and existing tools are not capable of implementing at scale

1442
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,000
so can't do it

1443
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:44,200
Unless of course the only way to do it is to do it in the computer

1444
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:47,100
That might be possible, but it's practically impossible at the moment.

1445
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:49,540
Another very interesting idea

1446
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:50,740
The idea is this

1447
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:55,640
We also have some very interesting active surfactants

1448
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,800
These interface agents are called Sephechon in English

1449
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:59,940
And these interface agents

1450
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,600
It's just a thin layer of ink on the sea

1451
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,900
These inks if you can spread it out to sea

1452
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:11,400
Our water will be separated from the air

1453
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,100
it can't evaporate anymore

1454
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,600
Then the atmosphere will not get a source of water vapor

1455
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,200
That typhoon might not last

1456
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,800
In the computer, you can experiment and say

1457
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,700
If you block the whole ocean

1458
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,300
The typhoon will never come out

1459
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,900
So scientists do experiments

1460
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,000
throw these on the ocean

1461
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,400
And it's eco-friendly, bio-soluble, these

1462
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:39,600
Surfection's active surfactants

1463
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,800
But they were stupid and found that they couldn't stop

1464
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,700
Because the range of the typhoon is too large

1465
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,800
If you don't give me water here

1466
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,600
I come from another side

1467
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,200
so never stop

1468
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,900
Unless you completely block the entire sea

1469
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:58,000
Then this is definitely except in the virtual world of the computer

1470
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
None other than Avatar

1471
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,260
have a chance to do it

1472
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,600
it's an interesting topic

1473
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,600
i have a scientist

1474
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:07,760
keep exploring

1475
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:11,200
Of course this is the domain of the most avant-garde research

1476
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,960
To really transform the typhoon

1477
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,560
Maybe even more future technologies

1478
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,400
Another thought is

1479
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,460
satellite in the sky

1480
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,560
to collect sunlight

1481
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,960
concentrate sunlight on

1482
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,360
Some specific areas of typhoons

1483
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:29,160
heat up that area

1484
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:30,660
then look forward to say

1485
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:33,720
The typhoon will go in a certain direction

1486
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:36,220
Do not come to Taiwan but go to the Philippines

1487
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:38,320
right

1488
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:38,820
this

1489
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,860
This is of course very very

1490
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,220
unethical and immoral behavior

1491
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,060
so

1492
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,020
Of course I was just joking

1493
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,920
So that's a whole other topic

1494
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,220
Someone brought this up

1495
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:50,420
Some people have thought about it

1496
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,920
That's not possible with current technology

1497
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,520
but for us humans

1498
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,860
From a scientist's point of view

1499
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,660
from a scientific point of view

1500
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:00,020
attract us

1501
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,340
Some ways to fundamentally remove the typhoon problem

1502
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:07,000
However, in fact, these methods are not currently available.

1503
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,260
just some ideas

1504
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:10,940
This is my first stage today

1505
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:13,500
I want to hear everyone's feedback

1506
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,340
we go to the second stage

1507
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:17,340
let's have a beer

1508
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,840
Sorry, Zhongyuan Institute did not provide

1509
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,960
Okay, let's just imagine drinking a beer

1510
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:23,860
spirit again

1511
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:27,140
I just talked to you about the disaster caused by the typhoon

1512
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,000
I also know the typhoon

1513
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:30,540
if that's not enough

1514
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:32,540
There is a book you can read

1515
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:36,100
Then I introduced the typhoon may be related to the concept of climate

1516
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,660
Talk to the ocean at last about the makeover

1517
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:41,660
Are there any current Phase 1 questions?

1518
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,700
Not bad, obviously everyone absorbed

1519
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:50,860
that's good yes

1520
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
min GPA o Canada min GPA o Toronto

1521
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,820
right

1522
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:05,880
Um

1523
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,440
right

1524
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,760
right

1525
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:14,840
That's a broader issue than a typhoon.

1526
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:15,880
That

1527
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,400
that basically

1528
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,940
Thanks for reminding me

1529
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:21,240
What about the whole concept of a slideshow?

1530
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:24,580
It is part of the entire disaster prevention system of the entire government

1531
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,400
A more comprehensive part of thinking

1532
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,920
that other

1533
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,000
They are directly related to typhoons

1534
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,760
That

1535
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,320
The whole of our environment mentioned in it

1536
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:40,180
The changes in society itself include us in Taiwan, which is an obvious feature that includes

1537
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:42,240
Aging and declining birthrate

1538
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:46,580
Maybe he is emphasizing the concept of economic activities

1539
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:48,640
and society as a whole

1540
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:53,240
For example, I think it should be, he may be emphasizing that

1541
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,040
society has one

1542
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,340
a characteristic of aging

1543
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:59,900
So society is changing during this process

1544
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,040
The residents of these different age groups

1545
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,940
He's adapting to various disasters, maybe his conditions, etc.

1546
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:09,940
different must be considered

1547
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:13,520
Yes, of course the comparison I just mentioned

1548
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,680
a bit more general

1549
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,320
But he is the whole big country

1550
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:20,160
One related to security and disaster issues

1551
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,160
part of

1552
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:24,160
So to think more broadly

1553
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:26,600
good

1554
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,960
Yes one more question

1555
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,400
good yes

1556
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,920
then ask first

1557
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,920
Typhoon actually my feeling

1558
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,260
He should have the function of energy balance

1559
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:40,500
He takes the heat from a place closer to where he eats it

1560
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,000
north half

1561
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,700
Then if we block the typhoon

1562
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:47,640
Will it force our atmosphere

1563
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,000
The energy gap between the two sides is getting bigger and bigger

1564
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,880
In the end, a more terrible storm came out

1565
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,780
that's a very good question

1566
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,080
I will add to you

1567
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,040
Just now this is an expert's question

1568
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,040
our whole

1569
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,200
On Earth we know that the sun heats up more unevenly

1570
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:07,680
So it's warmer on average in the tropics.

1571
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,400
Heating by more radiation from the sun

1572
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,960
The higher the tail, the less

1573
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,440
In fact, scientists have analyzed

1574
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:18,200
That is, if our climate is to stabilize

1575
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,200
This energy must be redistributed

1576
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,760
reach an equilibrium

1577
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,040
Although the south is still

1578
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,560
The equator is still warm

1579
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,320
But at least it's not getting warmer

1580
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,840
or the base is getting warmer

1581
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,880
Then this effect depends on the delivery of a lot of air flow

1582
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,280
including ocean transport

1583
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,840
to adjust for temperature differences

1584
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,520
It is unstable when the difference is too large.

1585
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,960
its atmosphere is unstable or the ocean

1586
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,680
that if

1587
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:46,680
The presence of that typhoon did play an important role.

1588
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,640
It happened to be mentioned in that book

1589
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,040
Can help with this energy delivery

1590
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:54,280
So if this is more artificially changed

1591
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:57,920
is capable of disrupting the existing equilibrium of our climate

1592
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,000
then you must

1593
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
It's going to find a new balance point

1594
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Well, that does make a difference

1595
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
to what extent

1596
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Will there be other different changes?

1597
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
What about the weather for these so-called special freaks?

1598
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
In fact, there is research

1599
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
good question thanks

1600
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
ok my last question for phase one

1601
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Please tell me, if you say

1602
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Someday science has its way in science

1603
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
That is to block the typhoon

1604
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Will this cause sweating?

1605
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Thanks

1606
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Because the typhoon will bring abundant quantity

1607
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
If there is a scientific way to stop the typhoon

1608
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
no typhoon

1609
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Will the whole earth be a disaster of sweat?

1610
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
good question

1611
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
let me in fact we earth have very, very many

1612
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
not a typhoon

1613
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
But it's also a convective system that produces a lot of rainfall.

1614
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
The convective is the convective rain that rises from the air

1615
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,700
These systems may have a smaller range

1616
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,560
only tens of kilometers

1617
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,640
range of several kilometers

1618
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,200
they don't really rain

1619
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:10,600
The typhoon is one of the few cases

1620
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,800
but it's very organized

1621
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,280
tens to hundreds of kilometers

1622
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:19,940
This is a monster that combines airflow and rainfall

1623
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,840
is really a monster

1624
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,440
If this thing does not exist when

1625
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:27,880
Maybe nature has other ways of adjusting

1626
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:30,060
how to deal with it

1627
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:32,280
I'll get to that shortly

1628
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,780
So after we drink these four or five glasses

1629
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,280
let's continue

1630
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:41,560
Then I'll just get to your point from here

1631
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,480
In fact, we all know the typhoon forecast

1632
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,580
actually not that good

1633
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:48,480
You can also hear that you are sometimes very demanding

1634
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,680
would think why can't we do better

1635
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:54,480
Why can't weather forecasts be more accurate?

1636
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,180
You clearly said you would log in, why didn't you come?

1637
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:00,020
Then put a day off and said afterwards

1638
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,480
Ask us to make up driving, make up passengers and make up shifts

1639
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:05,340
Of course that's a very crazy idea

1640
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:08,700
But basically, you can see this example

1641
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,880
Typhoon Maeji 2010

1642
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:14,240
This one caused heavy rain in Suao. Do you remember this typhoon?

1643
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:16,540
it goes through the philippines

1644
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:20,780
At that time, predictions around the world were very different.

1645
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:23,280
The north side of the South Park is very inconsistent

1646
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,380
wait until after it passes the philippines

1647
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:28,080
Worldwide forecasts are also completely different

1648
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:30,280
No one knows Mo Zhong I

1649
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,580
This is the computer's prediction

1650
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:32,880
don't know where he's going

1651
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,480
Then this highlights the typhoon forecast

1652
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,780
there are many difficulties

1653
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:38,280
who do you trust

1654
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:41,080
In this example, if you choose the middle, you are right.

1655
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,480
he ended up like this

1656
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,880
Basically, when he was in the process

1657
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,780
While here, the typhoon is raining heavily

1658
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:49,180
also very strange

1659
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,280
But if you understand that this is the role of Qiutai

1660
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,480
you can understand

1661
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,580
Why is there rainfall caused by this co-organization?

1662
01:16:56,580 --> 01:17:00,080
But if this path is different, then the shape of the rainfall

1663
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,340
must change completely

1664
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:04,860
Therefore, the entry forecast of typhoon

1665
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:07,600
I have always wanted to understand how typhoons change

1666
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,940
the most basic question

1667
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,640
Speaking of which, we will involve

1668
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,540
I'm sorry this one hasn't turned it into Chinese yet

1669
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:19,940
The progress of our entire science now

1670
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:23,040
is to digitize the problem

1671
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,340
We use computers to predict typhoons

1672
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,840
But this is definitely far beyond

1673
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,240
What we now call the Dimension Doushu

1674
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,280
You will know when you enter the generated horoscope

1675
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,980
possible future

1676
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,780
or short-term or long-term development of fate

1677
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:40,380
This is indeed based on our understanding of the entire

1678
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,340
The basic operation of nature, physics, chemistry and mathematics

1679
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:45,940
some fundamental principles

1680
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:49,380
Including simply speaking Newton's laws of motion

1681
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:50,940
laws of thermodynamics etc.

1682
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:53,780
to understand the fluids in our atmosphere

1683
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:55,080
how to change

1684
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,620
take all these processes

1685
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,120
with we can

1686
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Mathematical way to do it

1687
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Solutions of Differential Equations

1688
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
then go find out its answer

1689
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Then we construct this thing called numerical mode

1690
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
if you can tell me this fluid

1691
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Current state

1692
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I may be able to predict the future state

1693
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
What about the entire computer in the world?

1694
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
progress

1695
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
has a large level

1696
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
are working together to solve this problem

1697
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
as long as the computer every other year

1698
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
We all know that there is an electricity

1699
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
it will increase the speed of its operation

1700
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
degree of change

1701
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
that's almost working with us

1702
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Development of Atmospheric Computing

1703
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
five years ago

1704
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
In Japan there is a thing called Earth Simulator

1705
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
It's as big as a rain bomb

1706
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
that's all in operation

1707
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
It was the fastest computer in the world at the time

1708
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Its floating point operation speed per second

1709
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
is 40 multiplied to the power of 12

1710
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
so very very fast

1711
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:57,000
terabytes the flux every second

1712
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
The updated computer is now in the United States

1713
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Then the US won him back

1714
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,240
back face

1715
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,040
in Tennessee

1716
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,240
What about the new system in the United States?

1717
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,040
about fifty times that

1718
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:13,640
Now it is the Flux of two times ten to the fifteenth power

1719
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,160
then it is faster

1720
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,360
But most of them are doing this calculation

1721
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:20,240
Understanding Changes in Our Earth's Climate

1722
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:23,000
But there is a fundamental problem with this calculation

1723
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,400
You may have heard

1724
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,440
called this effect

1725
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,440
effect called chaos

1726
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:35,080
Then if we have any uncertainty about the initial state

1727
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:39,080
Future predictions are likely to get worse and worse

1728
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:42,480
just a little bit

1729
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,720
Ten millimeters are a thousand miles away

1730
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,520
It can be completely different in the end

1731
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,480
Then this feature was discovered by a famous scholar

1732
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,480
That's Edward Lorenz

1733
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:56,200
What about this teacher I studied in my school days?

1734
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:59,600
He actually has been in the past few years ago

1735
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,600
in his world

1736
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:07,440
In fact, in the past few years, it is said that they were still in the final list of the Nobel Prize in Physics.

1737
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:11,520
It's a pity, of course, that he died before he won the award.

1738
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,080
But this is a very large research contribution

1739
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,900
That effect is also called the butterfly effect.

1740
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:21,240
It makes it very difficult for us to forecast the weather or typhoon

1741
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,800
Because we have no idea what a typhoon looks like in the first place

1742
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:25,080
That

1743
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,880
because of this problem

1744
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:32,000
I've just been working on a research project for the past few years and I'm going to wrap up with you today with this project

1745
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:40,440
The key to this is that we need better data to improve our typhoon predictions

1746
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,280
However, the data around the typhoon are very limited.

1747
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,600
Then I just mentioned that we have

1748
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:47,880
radar

1749
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:50,440
There are satellites in the sky to assist us

1750
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:56,320
The radar has its limit because the radar may be able to do what he does

1751
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:57,300
Electromagnetic waves

1752
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:58,840
in the atmosphere

1753
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,600
It may be able to detect atmospheric features within two to three hundred kilometers

1754
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,200
So when the typhoon approaches

1755
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,500
You can tell where it's raining by looking at the radar

1756
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:09,400
very useful

1757
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,300
But if the typhoon is farther away

1758
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,800
you can't even see

1759
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:17,800
Satellites are hundreds of kilometers from us to 7800 kilometers

1760
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,600
This orbiting satellite reaches the so-called 36,000 kilometers

1761
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,200
This geostationary satellite is also monitoring the characteristics of our atmosphere

1762
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,300
Then these waves through different batteries

1763
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,500
microwave, etc.

1764
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:31,900
visible light infrared

1765
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:36,000
The atmospheric temperature and other information generated by various signals

1766
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,500
It also tells us the location of typhoons, etc.

1767
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:43,300
But the key to a typhoon is how the wind blows

1768
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:46,700
These ways we call panning

1769
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,800
There is no way to measure it very accurately.

1770
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,100
That makes our initial judgment on the typhoon

1771
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:52,700
there are some errors

1772
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:55,600
All make this chaotic effect continue to amplify

1773
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,100
Then in order to solve this problem

1774
01:21:58,100 --> 01:21:59,900
scientists will know

1775
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Use an airplane to detect typhoons

1776
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,340
Because this is the only instrument that can put the observation

1777
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:06,340
directly to the vicinity of the typhoon

1778
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,340
direct way to measure

1779
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:11,840
However, this method does have a relatively large risk

1780
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,340
let me speed up

1781
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:14,340
That

1782
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:15,640
in America

1783
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,140
has matured

1784
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:20,140
They have been since 1970

1785
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:22,140
It has very mature technology

1786
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:26,100
He uses this C-130 transport plane

1787
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:28,600
Or this anti-submarine aircraft called P3

1788
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,300
or this jet

1789
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:32,800
Fly around the typhoon to detect the typhoon

1790
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,300
He throws this from the air

1791
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,800
The instrument used in the cold test is called Touluosong

1792
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,500
he is in the process of landing

1793
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,500
The process of transferring from the air to the sea

1794
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,500
atmospheric information

1795
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,500
temperature, humidity, air pressure

1796
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,500
measure out

1797
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,500
How about measuring wind speed?

1798
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:52,500
Because he will swing with the wind in the air

1799
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,500
shift

1800
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,300
he can talk to

1801
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:55,900
That's the effect of the wind

1802
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,700
he can

1803
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,800
He knows how much the wind will move

1804
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,200
he has precise

1805
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,400
GPS location so it can make an indirect calculation of how the wind is blowing

1806
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:08,100
So it also measures the magnitude and direction of the wind

1807
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:10,700
then we can reconstruct the structure of the typhoon

1808
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:16,300
Especially these two C-130 and P-3 aircraft

1809
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,800
It is usually crossed to the center of the typhoon

1810
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,900
What about after this way of flying?

1811
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:25,300
We can create typhoon structures in different four directions

1812
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:31,900
This is the only effective method that can fully resolve the typhoon's characteristics at present

1813
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:36,400
The whole world is now only in the Atlantic Ocean that has done such work for a long time

1814
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:39,200
Other sunny typhoons can't help

1815
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:45,000
Then I will be close to this job

1816
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,500
It happened to be in 1991 when I was in graduate school

1817
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,100
At that time, my advisor was the author of the book I just talked about.

1818
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:56,200
he happened to have he had he was a theorist

1819
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:00,000
He would love to do a big time enlisting his theory

1820
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
what theory

1821
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:04,340
How do typhoons form

1822
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:06,740
Worldwide in tropical ocean

1823
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:07,920
three steps five o'clock

1824
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:11,620
Just to answer the lady's question

1825
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:14,580
There's a lot of convection going on

1826
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,380
But most of the convection

1827
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:18,780
Clouds grow and it rains

1828
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:22,380
It usually only has a lifespan of a few hours

1829
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:24,100
Dissipate after downloading

1830
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,860
Wait for the next cloud to grow

1831
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,200
They can't organize into a typhoon

1832
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,000
only very very few

1833
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,200
These convective clouds can become typhoons

1834
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:34,900
our world year

1835
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:38,000
Only 80 to 90 typhoons can grow

1836
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:41,700
Here's another interesting scientific question

1837
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:45,800
what climate is controlling this one 90

1838
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:47,400
the magic number

1839
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:50,100
roughly this is a long number

1840
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,400
80 to 90

1841
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:53,400
The total number of typhoons in the world in a year

1842
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,400
that's all

1843
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,100
Our rations are at Northwest Sun's

1844
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,000
The quota is about 30 or so

1845
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
That's the most in the world right here

1846
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,000
As for the less important places, there are about a dozen of them here.

1847
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
here are ten more

1848
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
just answered there

1849
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Someone asked me why there is no typhoon in Europe when I was eating just now

1850
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
One is the high tail and the other is the typhoon, both headed westward.

1851
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Then the high-tail typhoon was too cold and dissipated.

1852
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
In addition, it is interesting for you to ask

1853
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
If you don't have it, it's because you don't have enough

1854
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,000
The rotation provided by the rotation of our earth is called the Coschel force

1855
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Then this interested friend can go to find the root of this problem

1856
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
But there is no here, so why?

1857
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
The sea temperature here is relatively cold, so there are no typhoons

1858
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Then why is the sea temperature colder here?

1859
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
It just so happens that the ocean current over there has the eternal current over there

1860
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
The sea water rising from the bottom of the sea has completely cooled this side

1861
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
The sea temperature here is about three to five degrees lower.

1862
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Much lower here even in his summer

1863
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,000
why not here

1864
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,700
Ok this is our Homework for today

1865
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:10,500
Homework, please find the answer

1866
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,500
Why is there no one here, okay?

1867
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,000
ok i'm back here

1868
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:19,000
Then my advisor wants to know why typhoons grow here

1869
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:23,500
He has a theory, so he decides to test it out.

1870
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:26,500
That's when the only typhoon grows

1871
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
This place is still very close to mainland Mexico.

1872
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,500
So we can take the plane to Mexico to detect the typhoon

1873
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Then it is difficult here because in the wild ocean

1874
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,500
It's also very difficult here

1875
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:43,000
So, I just happened to be playing the role of volunteer

1876
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Just go to this event to answer this question

1877
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,000
Then our design is like this

1878
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
This has a theory, you have to prove it

1879
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:55,500
You should prove that you can only prove that the theory is wrong

1880
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,500
You can't prove the theory is right

1881
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:00,500
You can only testify whether your answer is positive

1882
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,600
In fact, just supporting does not mean that the theory must be correct.

1883
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:08,200
But if you can just find a different result, the theory is wrong.

1884
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:11,520
There's a lot of cloud development here

1885
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:16,900
We also flew into these clouds to see the typhoon with the Nichiri machine crossed by two planes.

1886
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,180
after reading it

1887
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:21,760
You can bring back data to know that some of these clouds are missing

1888
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,060
Some clouds turned into typhoons

1889
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:28,920
Then you compare the specific characteristics of which clouds become typhoons

1890
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,980
Information on the physics of the atmosphere

1891
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,780
to explain some theories

1892
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:36,860
Through this method we conduct experiments

1893
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:42,480
Then I happened to be very lucky to participate in this experiment and learned a lot at that time.

1894
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:43,260
That

1895
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:45,560
Didn't this typhoon fly over a typhoon?

1896
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:49,400
This plane flies over a typhoon and will leave a typhoon mark

1897
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,200
What about this imprint?

1898
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:54,260
By then he had 44

1899
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:56,820
There are two imprints in it, please see

1900
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:59,380
It grows in a different direction, these two

1901
01:27:59,380 --> 01:27:59,880
Why

1902
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Because he once flew to the southern hemisphere

1903
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,000
The direction of the typhoon there is just anti-symmetrical to our northern hemisphere

1904
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:17,000
It was the first time in my life that I flew into a typhoon rock that developed from the rain slowly and slowly for three days

1905
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
So it's a rare life experience

1906
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
but most importantly

1907
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Participate in an experiment where students learn all research methods and tools for free

1908
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Some attitudes or experiences when communicating with scientists are also good

1909
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Then when I got on the plane for the first time, I thought to myself

1910
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Oh right, why is there no such thing as a flight attendant?

1911
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
In fact, it was all hard work by the technicians.

1912
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
It's all equipment

1913
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
i tied myself tight

1914
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
The first sentence is to ask those scientific and technical personnel to say

1915
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Hey, why did you take off before taking a lecture?

1916
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
What about the safety lecture?

1917
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
He said

1918
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
ah he just told me

1919
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Don't worry

1920
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
do not worry

1921
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
no problem

1922
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
no problem

1923
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
not bad

1924
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Because in the typhoon at sea

1925
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
in case something goes wrong

1926
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
then accept fate

1927
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
But luckily everything went well

1928
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
In fact, the United States from 1970 to the present

1929
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
There are so many planes that fly into the typhoon

1930
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
There is no record of any so-called casualties

1931
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
there may have been

1932
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
no more after that

1933
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Then if you have such experience

1934
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
NOAA

1935
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Also present you with a certificate

1936
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,000
That's one of the baby in my life

1937
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
that's all

1938
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
I believe that few people have the opportunity

1939
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
do such activities

1940
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
I happen to own this one

1941
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
He also wrote some very touching...

1942
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
can't say touching

1943
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
some encouraging words

1944
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
There is such a Mr. Wu

1945
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
deliberately on that day

1946
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
purposefully

1947
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Where can I travel with my senseless spirit?

1948
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Go inside the eyeball of some wicked typhoon in the West Indies

1949
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:09,040
This selfless orange and hero's devotion

1950
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:12,200
To us in science is to give him the highest tribute

1951
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:14,700
oh thank you

1952
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:17,840
sorry

1953
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,900
I just hinted that that wasn't intentional

1954
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:20,800
good

1955
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,700
after i return to taiwan

1956
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,400
Of course, a lot of basic research has been done

1957
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,600
That research just now is not my doctoral thesis either.

1958
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:28,600
It's a process of my experience

1959
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,300
I just had a chance later

1960
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:31,900
I also find this question interesting

1961
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:35,000
I'm going to share this with you in the last ten minutes

1962
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:37,700
The experience of developing this scientific research

1963
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,200
If there are young friends here today,

1964
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,600
I also hope to have some inspiration

1965
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:45,300
That is of course the process of learning

1966
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:47,500
learn a lot of different facets

1967
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:50,100
Then I just had this chance at last

1968
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:54,240
It's time to let go and make a fortune

1969
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:56,640
It just so happens that we put it together

1970
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:59,680
Then I was nearly ten years ago

1971
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,800
It's been ten years

1972
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:04,600
I organized it almost ten years ago

1973
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,140
such a new plan

1974
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:08,200
Hope NSC Hope Says

1975
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,720
We have a focused study

1976
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:11,780
There is a relatively breakthrough development

1977
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:15,360
I just come up with ideas that I might be able to do

1978
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,680
I think we have an opportunity to do this kind of detection as well.

1979
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:22,780
This project is me and a very good colleague

1980
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:24,320
made together

1981
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:27,140
So this job is actually a teamwork

1982
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:28,680
this is very important

1983
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:33,040
It took me a lot of time to design this logo to popularize

1984
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:33,800
besides

1985
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:36,100
I've been thinking about this term for a month

1986
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:38,660
I made up the word DustStar

1987
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:42,240
Of course it is meaningful when talking about typhoon observation

1988
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,820
It just so happens that this is dim sum

1989
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:46,340
DustStar

1990
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:47,880
mentioned on my page

1991
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:50,440
like in the night sky of a typhoon

1992
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:54,280
Like the stars that lit up the night sky after we went to observe

1993
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:56,320
just the intention

1994
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:59,380
So our team is still doing well

1995
01:31:59,380 --> 01:31:59,920
DustStar

1996
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,300
of course it's a joke

1997
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:08,700
Basically, when I visited the United States in 2007, I felt that the experiment was quite successful

1998
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:11,780
Just google to find out that most of the ambassadors are famous

1999
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:15,100
It turned out to be a new British rock band.

2000
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:19,700
But we also took a photo of him looking like this at the gate of National Taiwan University

2001
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:21,000
big breath door

2002
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:21,500
good

2003
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,300
what about our plan

2004
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:28,160
Basically, we rented a jet plane from Hanxiang in Taichung to detect the typhoon

2005
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,860
And this detection is strategic

2006
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:36,360
We're going to find some places where the atmosphere is particularly sensitive to throw our heads

2007
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:37,960
The instrument just mentioned

2008
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:42,060
I hope this can change our understanding and prediction of typhoons

2009
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:46,160
Then we did another job to measure the results

2010
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:53,360
Even if it is released to any research unit and forecast center in the world, it is not hidden at all

2011
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:58,860
Some studies say that the observers use the data for two years before others can use it.

2012
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:00,060
Because of the typhoon

2013
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
So this impact is comprehensive and immediate

2014
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,000
It's a pity to keep it for my own use

2015
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
That's also because we share it on the instant

2016
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,000
We compile the data in the air and pass it on

2017
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,000
So it can be taken back to WMO all over the world

2018
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
all used countries

2019
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Then maybe our back helmet will be bigger

2020
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Then it faces many problems

2021
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Then I may have an opportunity to introduce this to you later.

2022
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
In the blink of an eye, more than nine years have passed

2023
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
We have detected many, many typhoons

2024
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And most of these typhoons have affected Taiwan

2025
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
and even the surrounding countries

2026
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Everyone can see that this door is all about us in the air

2027
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Traces of every instrument ever dropped

2028
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Typhoon passing by

2029
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
So all the measuring instruments we've lost so far

2030
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
nearly a thousand lost

2031
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,000
So it's a really big research effort

2032
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
ongoing

2033
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Of course, there are also a lot of research rumors

2034
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,020
I'll show you some pictures

2035
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:05,820
Aren't we always comparing this movement in the air

2036
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:07,220
This is exactly one of them

2037
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:12,420
The whole design of our BNFAY is in the Central Meteorological Bureau

2038
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:14,860
if you know how to get on the web

2039
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:16,860
You can see where our planes go

2040
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,360
Then measure what data

2041
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:21,460
Similar to the original satellite and radar pictures

2042
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:22,500
all will be combined

2043
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:25,660
It's all on the Bureau of Meteorology's webpage

2044
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:27,140
immediately visible

2045
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:29,640
But there is a specific URL that is

2046
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:31,640
Not everyone can find it

2047
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:34,640
This information will be available to anyone who can find it

2048
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:38,640
The Central Weather Service in their combined

2049
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:40,640
all the different sources of observation

2050
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,140
Information about our aircraft

2051
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:45,140
He can study and judge the original characteristics of the typhoon

2052
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:48,640
Of course, this is only the so-called application part

2053
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:51,640
Our research is like my example

2054
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:53,140
We call it target observation

2055
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:55,140
like the so-called target

2056
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:59,140
A treatment like chemotherapy

2057
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,500
This is called targeted therapy

2058
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:05,500
Our method is called targeted observation

2059
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:06,500
to measure

2060
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:09,500
The most famous example is not a paper I wrote

2061
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:12,500
It was made by the Japanese who worked with us

2062
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,000
In this example inside

2063
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
We went to measure various data of this typhoon

2064
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Three of these are targets

2065
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
As a result we found

2066
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Japanese found

2067
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,500
Prediction of typhoon direction by the weather model of the whole Japan

2068
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,500
this is the actual direction

2069
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:30,500
After using this data

2070
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,000
Typhoon will turn around

2071
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
if not

2072
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,500
The typhoon will come here in the wrong direction

2073
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,000
that this one

2074
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,500
The results of this study probably helped us gain popularity

2075
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:45,000
Then I quote a movie I watched before called

2076
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,500
Oh, this one is called honey, there seems to be this movie

2077
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:50,000
I made the kid bigger or smaller

2078
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
We turned the typhoon

2079
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Of course it means that we take the typhoon forecast

2080
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,500
The prediction turned out to be in the direction he should go

2081
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,020
After nearly many years of research

2082
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:07,860
We found that on average we can reduce the error by about 20%

2083
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:12,660
That is to say, the original error may predict the position of the typhoon one day later

2084
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:17,460
There may be an average error of 100 kilometers between the present and the actual situation

2085
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:19,660
It can become only 80 kilometers left

2086
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:20,800
not perfect

2087
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:24,060
Because the atmosphere is not perfectly predictable.

2088
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:28,660
However, there are possibilities and results for improvement after the information is available

2089
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:34,800
In 2008 we succeeded because of this

2090
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:38,600
The whole of Asia has started a new experiment

2091
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,840
This experiment is through our aircraft

2092
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:44,060
Like inviting the United States to bring two large planes

2093
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:47,800
And Japan also came to fly all the typhoons with a plane

2094
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,200
So we cross explored

2095
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:53,260
At that time, it was equal to the typhoon in the Northwest Pacific in 2008

2096
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:54,300
what to explore

2097
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:58,100
The life and death of the whole typhoon

2098
01:36:58,100 --> 01:36:59,700
how did it grow

2099
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
How did it dissipate in the end

2100
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
All in this experiment want to answer

2101
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
It's never been done before with a test flight

2102
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Of course it will require a lot of cooperation

2103
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
We can imagine test piloting planes flying together in the sky

2104
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
The planes all depart from different countries

2105
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
stagger together at last

2106
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
it's all designed

2107
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Of course it is impossible to collide

2108
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
that this team

2109
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,000
It is developed under the framework of the whole WMO

2110
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
There are representatives from various countries

2111
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
There is a country called Dustar

2112
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Sorry can't use the name Taiwan

2113
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
What about after we do this?

2114
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,000
There was a famous example

2115
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Xinleke Typhoon

2116
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
First time in the Pacific Northwest

2117
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
with our planes flying around like this

2118
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I'm on this plane

2119
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Then the US plane flew from Guam

2120
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
There is another plane from the United States flying over.

2121
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Japanese planes fly over from Tokyo's Atsuki Airport

2122
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
the military airport

2123
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,600
Then go around here and go back, stop at the airport in Okinawa

2124
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:07,680
Test pilots fly together for the first time in the Pacific Northwest

2125
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:10,880
I showed you the simplest example

2126
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:14,320
This paper has also been published

2127
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:17,120
Our observations show

2128
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:19,120
If there is this information

2129
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:21,760
The typhoon will turn this way, close to the typhoon

2130
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:26,400
The computer will predict that the blue line is very close to the actual red line

2131
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,400
Forecast from this time

2132
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:30,640
What if we don't use these observations?

2133
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:32,640
it will be green, it's wrong

2134
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,840
It's the same here, it's a day later

2135
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,840
Then this photo is

2136
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,440
We always remember to leave a photo before every flight

2137
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,440
As a souvenir

2138
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:46,960
Then the In case newspaper needs to be used the next day

2139
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:48,960
But it's not used yet

2140
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,680
In theory, it was a very sweet year.

2141
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,680
That National Geographic

2142
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:55,680
Just made a documentary about our story

2143
01:38:55,680 --> 01:39:00,000
In the next year, 2001, every two years

2144
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,200
That is, two years ago we got another one

2145
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:05,360
Another larger international experiment was organized

2146
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,800
This is cooperation with Taiwan's marine community

2147
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:09,800
we still fly

2148
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:12,300
This cooperation was just mentioned to you

2149
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:13,800
we're going to explore the ocean

2150
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:16,700
Both the atmosphere and the ocean

2151
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:19,360
So our domestic and foreign oceans

2152
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,360
Ships go to sea to detect

2153
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,200
It must have the detection instruments of this ocean

2154
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,000
Still have to go below 100 meters

2155
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,700
The thermal structure of the ocean

2156
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:31,400
Structure of Temperature Structure of Density

2157
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:35,200
See how it changes before and after the typhoon

2158
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:38,200
To understand how much the ocean is affected by typhoons

2159
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:41,700
and how much it affects the subsequent development of the typhoon

2160
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:46,700
The result you see is like this photo

2161
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:49,200
we made a

2162
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:51,600
very interesting surround

2163
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:55,300
American planes fly in it

2164
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:58,400
We still need to use the phone in the air

2165
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,800
connect with computer

2166
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,700
in contact with each other

2167
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:04,860
Because they don't want us to fly higher

2168
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:06,500
about 13 kilometers

2169
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:10,460
They fly at an altitude of only about 4 kilometers to 5 kilometers

2170
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:11,940
They don't want us flying over their heads

2171
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:13,700
just drop things

2172
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:16,260
Although the chances of hitting are very, very low

2173
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,700
But they still hope not

2174
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:20,900
it's all planned

2175
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:23,800
This study is actually quite interesting

2176
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:26,440
So in 2004

2177
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:28,740
In fact we're only doing it for the second year

2178
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:30,540
2005

2179
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:33,600
The news bureau made this an interesting topic

2180
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,500
as in

2181
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:39,240
It is tantamount to promoting the development of Taiwan's technology

2182
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:40,540
this issue

2183
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:43,180
Coincidentally, I got one

2184
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:44,240
Introduced Award

2185
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:47,100
It shouldn't have anything to do with the hero

2186
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:48,740
The director is too strong

2187
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:51,340
But more memorable

2188
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:53,200
Later, a documentary

2189
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,980
This is the National Geographic Channel

2190
01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:56,240
he followed me

2191
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:59,540
The process of doing this task in 2008

2192
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
I have a few copies of this documentary

2193
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:08,000
Our DVD if interested students today especially

2194
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,500
If you are interested or children

2195
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,000
I'm happy to share

2196
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:18,000
Of course there are many rare photos in the air

2197
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:23,500
Everyone can see that if you are not in the sky, you can see a typhoon in your lower field of vision

2198
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,500
In fact, if mentioned at the beginning

2199
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:29,500
This is a beautiful scientific study

2200
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
But of course it has its challenges

2201
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
because as a presenter

2202
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
We have a great responsibility to make sure

2203
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
The whole process is safe

2204
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:44,000
And of course we were able to do this research mainly because of government funding.

2205
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
So be very careful

2206
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Hope to achieve what we should do

2207
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:52,500
over the past ten years

2208
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:56,000
Probably all the relevant research I have been engaged in is in this field.

2209
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,500
Trying to answer questions about different aspects of the typhoon

2210
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,300
Hope to find an updated answer

2211
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:05,300
I was lucky enough to find some results

2212
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:08,640
Well, of course I'm on this plane today.

2213
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:12,680
Introduced to you about the strategic measurement part

2214
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:14,840
As I introduced at the beginning today

2215
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:17,600
Typhoon measurement has many different aspects

2216
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,480
In fact, it is still under development

2217
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:21,800
and we're still working on it

2218
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,280
Maybe there will be more opportunities in the future

2219
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,980
Let me introduce more results

2220
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:27,780
Of course it's a Vision

2221
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:31,140
That is to say, in fact there needs to be one more

2222
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:35,340
good scientists and researchers to participate

2223
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:37,880
In order to bring this research to a higher level

2224
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:41,580
And it can solve the problems of science and people's livelihood

2225
01:42:41,580 --> 01:42:44,180
Well I guess it's one of our visions

2226
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:47,820
then let me introduce to you

2227
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:49,920
what chance is there in the future

2228
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:53,080
In the United States, they have figured out a way to update

2229
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:55,680
to replace the existing aircraft

2230
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:59,280
They use this very famous one called Global Hawk

2231
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,400
Unmanned aircraft called Voice of the Sky

2232
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,160
this plane is a reconnaissance plane

2233
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:08,440
was used in the Iraq war to detect

2234
01:43:08,940 --> 01:43:12,220
The so-called important key tool of where the enemy is

2235
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:15,820
The other plane is called the Predator

2236
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:18,340
Just go fire the missiles, you probably know

2237
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:21,420
This drone just happens to have a few

2238
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,200
Americans came up with an idea

2239
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:27,380
Donate to NASA Donate to NASA from the Department of Defense

2240
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:31,220
NASA is going to use this plane to detect

2241
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:33,340
First target to detect typhoon

2242
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:35,620
This experiment has been carried out

2243
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:36,980
currently flying

2244
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:39,620
The plan for this experiment is well organized

2245
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:40,920
just a good friend of mine

2246
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:44,720
Here's a photo of him standing on this Global retreat

2247
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:46,060
they will

2248
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:49,780
I've been experimenting with this aircraft since about last year

2249
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:52,060
This Plane Flies Higher Unmanned Aircraft

2250
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:54,140
Fly at an altitude of 18 kilometers

2251
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:55,540
above the typhoon

2252
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:57,800
So he is less affected by the typhoon

2253
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:00,140
And he can fly for a long time at a time

2254
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,600
There are a few days so you can constantly monitor the typhoon

2255
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:09,000
The organizer happened to be at the beginning of June

2256
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:12,000
Almost two months ago, I visited Taiwan

2257
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:16,000
Then I was also discussing with him whether they should consider

2258
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Fly this aircraft to the Pacific Northwest to try it out

2259
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:23,400
But we're now waiting for their results in the Atlantic

2260
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:25,600
if this goes well

2261
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:29,500
Maybe this will be the mainstream of typhoon observation around the world in the future

2262
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,800
Of course this plane is very expensive

2263
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:37,800
Fortunately, the aircraft donated to them by the Ministry of National Defense of the country are doing such detection

2264
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:40,700
May change our future study of typhoons

2265
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:43,200
Instead of various observation tools

2266
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:46,800
And this Gu Liang without any staff is safe Gu Liang

2267
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:52,000
The last story is to tell you about the past 10 years

2268
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,700
I travel all over the world like this

2269
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:55,900
Every point is a place I've been

2270
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:58,500
So as a scientist

2271
01:44:58,500 --> 01:44:59,900
can be regarded as a person

2272
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
a variety of experiences

2273
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,500
We go to various places to meet and do experiments

2274
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:07,500
to learn new things

2275
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:10,000
Then I just talked about 2002

2276
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
i was there once

2277
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:16,500
What about the typhoon seminar held by the World Meteorological Organization of the United Nations every four years?

2278
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:17,500
every Quadrennial

2279
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:19,500
2002 to CANES

2280
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:23,500
I just happened to experience my first dive in my life

2281
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:26,000
then the scientist

2282
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
this scientist is very famous

2283
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,500
Just happened to go diving with me

2284
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
just the two of us

2285
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,500
Just then we each had a baby

2286
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:38,500
So we hugged a CQCumbers sea cucumber each

2287
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,500
It's like a baby passport

2288
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:44,500
As a result, I now have a very good research understanding and cooperation with him.

2289
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:48,000
Maybe it's all because we once lived together under the sea

2290
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,500
The other one I just talked about

2291
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:55,500
We also went to Costoreca for the once-in-a-decade meeting of the World Meteorological Organization

2292
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,500
I came to this place two years ago

2293
01:45:57,500 --> 01:46:00,500
No one ever knows where to go

2294
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,600
Call Lara Union on Liu Niwang Island

2295
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:03,680
in the indian ocean

2296
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:05,320
south indian ocean

2297
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:07,520
very nice beach

2298
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,320
Like this is not the same as Su this

2299
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:12,520
These so-called

2300
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:14,840
This place in the prefecture of Mar

2301
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:15,880
world famous

2302
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:17,480
then we just went to a meeting

2303
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:19,120
I'm just talking and doing research

2304
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:21,320
Actually there are many interesting parts

2305
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:24,600
There are many people who are doing and are pursuing life

2306
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:26,360
direction of young friends

2307
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:28,800
Maybe we can join this ranks in the future

2308
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,720
I'm lucky enough to say

2309
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,600
I just happened to quote this Steve Jobs

2310
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:37,840
at Stanford University in 2005

2311
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,440
The content of this Speech

2312
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,320
Although he is unfortunate

2313
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:42,320
he has passed away

2314
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,080
But he talked about it a few years ago

2315
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,120
life is about connecting this

2316
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:47,920
a lot of bits and pieces

2317
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:49,400
I saw this DUTZ

2318
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:52,240
It can be combined with my DUTZ DUTZ quite well

2319
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:54,480
Then I think I'm very lucky too

2320
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,440
Take what you have learned in the past

2321
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:57,120
shine up

2322
01:46:57,120 --> 01:46:58,880
So right now at this

2323
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:00,000
very special

2324
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,020
Research areas continue to evolve

2325
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:07,640
Okay, what about yesterday? Today Vice President Peng mentioned

2326
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:09,260
We flew to the typhoon

2327
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:13,260
You can see we did a probe

2328
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:15,600
This information is placed on the website

2329
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,780
This typhoon is still developing

2330
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:21,220
But I can't say much under the meteorological law.

2331
01:47:21,220 --> 01:47:24,560
But I think this typhoon may still be very threatening

2332
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:26,320
or please pay more attention

2333
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,820
I was going to share a video

2334
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:33,120
But let's put this short story of ours

2335
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,120
Also made a song and video

2336
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:37,620
It was made by a college student of mine

2337
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:39,620
I made it into a MV

2338
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:42,420
But this allows interested colleagues to perhaps go

2339
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:45,120
Find the answer of Fengshou and you will see

2340
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:47,420
The last thing I want to tell you is

2341
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:49,920
This study is actually very lucky

2342
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:53,220
It's because government funding gives us the opportunity to do

2343
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:55,720
so i want to thank many people

2344
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:57,720
that's like thank god

2345
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,800
Taiwanese kids are very smart

2346
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:04,100
I heard that there is still this composition

2347
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:07,440
of course it was a joke

2348
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:08,500
yes

2349
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:11,400
the last thing i want to say is

2350
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:15,200
Thank you very much for the invitation of Academia Sinica

2351
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:19,500
Let everyone come together enthusiastically on the night of the typhoon

2352
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:22,500
Listen to me share our research abroad and experience

2353
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:24,300
look forward to seeing you again

2354
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:25,600
thank you all

2355
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:34,100
Thank you Director Wu for your wonderful speech

2356
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:40,600
From very simple to cutting-edge research

2357
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:43,600
I'm the moderator and I usually control the time

2358
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,800
So I hope it's 9 o'clock to let everyone go

2359
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,700
12 minutes left now

2360
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:49,900
protection time

2361
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:51,400
quick to ask questions

2362
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:52,800
OK

2363
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,000
ok thank you for a very good presentation

2364
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,600
From what you just said, it seems

2365
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:58,800
The information of the ocean

2366
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,800
very predictive

2367
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,440
So maybe in the future the big breath will combine with the ocean

2368
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:04,600
i'm kidding

2369
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:05,560
My question is actually

2370
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,760
Unlike the surveillance in the air

2371
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,440
You can fly through it quickly

2372
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:12,560
Then in the ocean when you have to do both sides

2373
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:16,240
Do you want to put a lot of ships?

2374
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:17,440
or is there anything massive

2375
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:20,720
There can also be a monitoring method for sentient beings who go Z

2376
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,840
Thank you for this very good question

2377
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:25,040
The first suggestion you just made

2378
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:27,560
It's actually very, very important

2379
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:30,440
In fact, many atmospheres and oceans abroad

2380
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:32,040
is the same technology

2381
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:35,960
Of course, there may be more appropriate and mature opportunities in China.

2382
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:37,440
should develop in that direction

2383
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,640
What about observations at sea?

2384
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:41,080
It's really difficult

2385
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:43,960
This is why ocean observations are not as rich as the atmosphere

2386
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:46,320
the ocean

2387
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,840
Each of your probes is actually very expensive

2388
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:52,080
If you want to detect the phone before and after the typhoon

2389
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,600
it also has a lot of risk

2390
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:55,920
Because it can't get close don't say typhoon

2391
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:58,040
any let big to a degree

2392
01:49:58,040 --> 01:49:59,240
can't get close anyway

2393
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,240
So if their design is to go through this kind of research

2394
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:06,140
At that time, the detection of the iTOP experiment just now

2395
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:09,540
it requires making very rigorous forecasts of our atmosphere

2396
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:11,240
To create a typhoon, go there

2397
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:15,340
Then it has to be 2 to 3 days before the typhoon goes in that direction

2398
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:19,560
The ship is already going to that location to arrange various detection camps.

2399
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:20,920
Then they will flash

2400
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:22,920
Then wait for the typhoon to pass

2401
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:25,980
So it's a little bit of a part like fishing

2402
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:29,560
Then if the typhoon doesn't go to those materials in the end

2403
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:30,680
still cold

2404
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:34,120
But there is no way to cool enough to see the information

2405
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:36,260
So currently is progress in this situation

2406
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:39,300
However, in these major international experiments

2407
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:42,300
It usually arranges more points just to ask for safety

2408
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:45,300
A web of data connected in one line

2409
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:49,540
Let the typhoon cool down to the surrounding area no matter where the typhoon passes

2410
01:50:49,540 --> 01:50:52,800
Especially what happened to the seabed before the typhoon passed by

2411
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:56,480
What does the bottom of the sea look like when you pass by

2412
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:58,880
If it's all cold enough, there will be results.

2413
01:50:58,880 --> 01:50:59,900
that result

2414
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,280
This food test was completed almost two years ago.

2415
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:07,400
At present, many scientists are paying attention to this research work

2416
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:10,360
so very avant-garde

2417
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:13,880
And there should be many new results to introduce in the future

2418
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:16,600
I did not talk about the results of this part of the results today

2419
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:19,840
If a large area grain survey is to be done

2420
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,840
possible over the ocean

2421
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,320
Yes, the ocean now has some automatic instruments too

2422
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,320
But what is the purpose of its grain testing?

2423
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:27,240
I might say for example

2424
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:31,200
I have some now with a grain measuring instrument called the Argo

2425
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:33,120
This instrument is very interesting

2426
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:37,360
The world has now deployed thousands of different seas around the world

2427
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:39,800
But its disadvantage is that it has no faults

2428
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,000
so it floats

2429
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,400
so you don't ignore where it is

2430
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:43,280
finally

2431
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,640
over a period of time

2432
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,920
All will float to the shore

2433
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:49,080
There is no way to stay where you want at sea

2434
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:50,960
I have no choice but to let it go

2435
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:52,280
what about it

2436
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:54,960
it will be because of the sunshine every day

2437
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,800
it will have some density change

2438
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:59,560
it will sink into the sea

2439
01:51:59,560 --> 01:52:00,560
then measure

2440
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,800
Then time, a certain time, it floats up again

2441
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:07,700
When it floated up, it measured the entire vertical data again.

2442
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:08,800
then when it floats up

2443
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:12,700
Its antenna can receive satellite signals

2444
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:14,200
It can transmit data to the satellite

2445
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:16,800
There is such a measure to pass the data out

2446
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:19,800
So different scientists are indeed designing

2447
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:22,000
Different measuring instruments help us solve

2448
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,500
This is not a problem that ships can solve

2449
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:27,000
it can use a ship to deploy this instrument

2450
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,300
then let it walk on the sea

2451
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:30,500
Then you can measure a lot

2452
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:33,100
There are ups and downs to measure the data

2453
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:36,500
The more active approach in our experiment is

2454
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:38,500
fly by plane

2455
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:40,900
Because the ship is sometimes slow, there is a risk

2456
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:44,100
Fly near the typhoon by plane

2457
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:46,500
From the plane, the plane has to fly lower

2458
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:50,100
Probably can only fly at an altitude of 1000 meters or 300 meters

2459
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:53,500
Under those conditions, drop the instrument

2460
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,600
After that instrument was thrown into the sea,

2461
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:58,600
The ocean's instruments will dive down to detect

2462
01:52:58,600 --> 01:52:59,800
What about a few days later?

2463
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,680
It will be recycled than

2464
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:03,120
because it is very expensive compared to

2465
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:04,680
Then it can also be detected

2466
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:06,080
But this whole design

2467
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:09,000
Requires a lot of technology including engineering

2468
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:10,640
But everyone is developing

2469
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:11,480
especially in

2470
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:14,320
Some advanced countries like the United States have

2471
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:17,160
It's good that this kind of facility is doing this kind of research work

2472
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:19,600
Then our domestic marine community also has related issues.

2473
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:20,120
nice

2474
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:21,480
some research like this

2475
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:22,720
some experience

2476
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,200
So I did this international cooperation just now

2477
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:28,280
good

2478
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:29,600
That is

2479
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:30,800
good last man

2480
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:31,840
use that microphone

2481
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:32,280
ok

2482
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:34,040
that's in

2483
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:36,440
Forecasting the Taiwan in the Taiwan area

2484
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:37,880
It seems that Taiwan is doing

2485
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:39,200
Japan is also doing

2486
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:40,240
America is doing

2487
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:42,440
The information on the seven items seems to be

2488
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,000
Countries are exchanging

2489
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,400
But often that predicts

2490
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:46,840
like

2491
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,200
Every country will be different

2492
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,200
where is the reason

2493
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:52,480
that Taiwan

2494
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:54,800
In the forecast near Taiwan

2495
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:57,280
Taiwan's path when

2496
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:59,200
Does Taiwan have any advantages?

2497
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,500
The second one is that it seems that in the past few years

2498
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:09,100
The Taiwan that passed the seventh place in Taiwan seems to be smaller than the average number

2499
01:54:09,100 --> 01:54:15,740
Then it seems that the chance to hear the strong Taiwan seems to be relatively small

2500
01:54:15,740 --> 01:54:17,140
what is the reason

2501
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:20,240
Nanakka may be due to loading

2502
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:23,100
But I feel that the number will be relatively small

2503
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:27,780
It seems to be different from the statistic of a writer you mentioned just now

2504
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:29,440
don't know how

2505
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:32,080
Okay, let me answer the second question first

2506
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:36,240
In fact, just now you mentioned whether it was some typhoon activity

2507
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:39,840
The frequency or intensity or character of passing through Taiwan

2508
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:45,080
Have there been any statistically significant changes over the past few years

2509
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:49,180
In fact, the typhoon has a certain variation in nature.

2510
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:53,380
Then there's some variability from year to year

2511
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:55,840
So if you look at the very short angle

2512
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:59,980
The significance of this statistic is not necessarily very special.

2513
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,100
In other words, we don't really know yet

2514
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:04,860
Is there such a noticeable change

2515
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:08,560
That some need you to strengthen some of these points

2516
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:11,200
More precise statistics may be needed

2517
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:12,160
we just know

2518
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:13,860
But it is clear that scientists

2519
01:55:13,860 --> 01:55:15,700
actually really understand

2520
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:19,100
For example, we are in the tropical ocean

2521
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:20,960
There will be a so-called holy cause

2522
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,360
sea ​​temperature will change

2523
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:25,360
While these changes happen every few years

2524
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:27,400
Typhoon Occurrence Area

2525
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:29,400
with some of its activities indeed

2526
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:30,460
will change

2527
01:55:30,460 --> 01:55:33,100
We already know more about these

2528
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:36,300
That's for a place close to Taiwan

2529
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:37,560
partial change

2530
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:39,660
In fact our statistics

2531
01:55:39,660 --> 01:55:42,300
relatively without an obvious age

2532
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:43,760
or change over the years

2533
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:45,500
We are less clear about this

2534
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:47,360
The other one needs more research

2535
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:50,260
So back to the question you asked at the beginning

2536
01:55:50,260 --> 01:55:51,800
What are the forecasts for each country?

2537
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:54,060
Meteorological data from all over the world

2538
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:56,300
under the framework of WMO

2539
01:55:56,300 --> 01:55:58,200
on the World Meteorological Organization

2540
01:55:58,200 --> 01:55:59,960
is fully opened

2541
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,800
So people all over the world can make predictions

2542
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:06,800
The so-called official meteorological units of each country

2543
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:09,300
But each country has its own computer model

2544
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:11,800
So it doesn't predict exactly the same

2545
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:13,500
This is because of the design of the schema

2546
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:17,500
How to enter the computer mode with its data

2547
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:19,500
different answers will be different

2548
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:21,800
Then sometimes everyone's results are the same

2549
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:23,300
when this happens

2550
01:56:23,300 --> 01:56:25,800
This typhoon is likely to be well controlled

2551
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:28,800
But when everyone is quite different

2552
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,600
It highlights that the typhoon has relatively high uncertainty.

2553
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:35,800
At the end of the day, every country has to make human judgments

2554
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:38,600
The result may vary

2555
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:42,300
So what special so-called advantage does Taiwan have?

2556
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:45,000
or advantage

2557
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:49,300
Basically, when the typhoon is very close to Taiwan

2558
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:53,000
Usually the location of the typhoon we do in Taiwan

2559
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,800
and analysis of its nearby movement

2560
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:58,600
will be more accurate than other countries

2561
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:00,000
because it affects

2562
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,300
So our input will compare

2563
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:04,860
Compared with the so-called extra manpower

2564
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:08,440
For example, he is also concerned about Japan

2565
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:10,500
But because he is not comfortable in his country

2566
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:13,300
He's just following normal procedures

2567
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:14,840
so there are some

2568
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:19,720
Then there are some very detailed information about our local radar in Taiwan, etc.

2569
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:24,060
Our weather analysts may use a higher amount

2570
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:27,640
Then in other countries because they don't have the first line to see these materials

2571
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:28,920
they may not be useful

2572
01:57:29,380 --> 01:57:30,460
will be slightly different

2573
01:57:30,980 --> 01:57:32,760
So statistically speaking

2574
01:57:33,020 --> 01:57:35,820
Currently there are different

2575
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:38,380
From the United States, Japan, Hong Kong, Beijing

2576
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:40,700
South Korea wait until our Central Weather Bureau

2577
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:44,280
The overall average level of the forecast of this typhoon

2578
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:49,400
Basically, if we talk about predicting the final level in Taiwan, it is probably the same order

2579
01:57:49,660 --> 01:57:50,940
about the same

2580
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:51,960
nothing special

2581
01:57:52,220 --> 01:57:53,500
That is to say, everyone is the same

2582
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:54,260
level

2583
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:56,060
At present, this level is about

2584
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,100
Average error of forecast for one day

2585
01:57:58,360 --> 01:57:58,860
perhaps

2586
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:00,100
average about nine

2587
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,200
10 to 100 kilometers

2588
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:02,300
so

2589
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:05,500
This may not be a big problem for other countries like the United States

2590
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:06,200
because big

2591
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:08,300
It is not a small issue for Taiwan

2592
01:58:08,300 --> 01:58:09,200
because

2593
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:11,500
We predict to go to Hualien

2594
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:14,300
Maybe in Taitung, but also in Yilan or Taikeelung

2595
01:58:15,100 --> 01:58:18,500
In addition, our vacation is based on counties and cities

2596
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,300
that's finer

2597
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:22,600
are within the margin of error of this forecast.

2598
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:24,200
this is our difficulty

2599
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:26,100
So I leave that question to

2600
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:27,300
those two

2601
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
two seniors

2602
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:30,500
good

2603
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:32,300
good

2604
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:33,400
that last question

2605
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:34,100
No

2606
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:35,900
is there a last question

2607
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:39,700
good

2608
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:43,100
Thanks

2609
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:46,200
Professor Wu's very brilliant speech

2610
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:48,200
I've always been curious

2611
01:58:48,200 --> 01:58:49,500
because we are in Taiwan

2612
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:51,100
Exposure to typhoons since childhood

2613
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:52,900
The typhoon that I heard from childhood

2614
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:55,600
That's what Professor Wu said at the beginning

2615
01:58:55,900 --> 01:58:58,900
It is the disaster brought by typhoon

2616
01:58:58,900 --> 01:58:59,900
then i always

2617
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,340
I am very curious, since the power of disasters brought by typhoons is so great

2618
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:09,260
Then believe that he also has such great energy

2619
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:15,460
Is there any way to convert the energy of this typhoon into kinetic energy beneficial to human beings?

2620
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:17,580
Thanks

2621
01:59:17,580 --> 01:59:19,880
Thank you for this simple

2622
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:22,080
Let's talk about wind energy first

2623
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:28,460
Yes indeed we have some so-called WinMill on the western or northern coast of Taiwan

2624
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:32,040
When this rotates, electricity is generated

2625
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:35,880
But the current design of these things

2626
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:40,500
Basically, the wind speed must be below a certain wind speed.

2627
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:42,400
In fact, above a certain wind speed

2628
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:46,060
basically dangerous to the operation of its machinery

2629
01:59:46,060 --> 01:59:47,660
it may break etc

2630
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:48,940
it just won't work

2631
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:54,060
Therefore, the strong wind of the typhoon will completely shut down the device under that condition.

2632
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:55,340
so useless

2633
01:59:55,340 --> 01:59:59,700
Then this may be limited by our modern technology for this typhoon.

2634
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,600
With such a strong wind speed

2635
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:07,940
We don't have a way to use that energy yet

2636
02:00:07,940 --> 02:00:10,000
it's really a pity

2637
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,800
But I haven't heard of it yet

2638
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:16,900
Is there any way to convert this part out

2639
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:19,200
Then we can also imagine that in fact

2640
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:22,780
For example, the normal storage of water in the reservoir can help generate electricity

2641
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:25,340
But in fact when the typhoon comes

2642
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:27,400
sometimes it's time to drain

2643
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:28,920
so there is no way

2644
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:31,220
do these many operations

2645
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:35,580
So this type belongs to the very violent, violent, and temporary type.

2646
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:38,380
how to use it

2647
02:00:38,380 --> 02:00:41,220
Personally, I still need a lot

2648
02:00:41,220 --> 02:00:45,060
There is still a lot of room for improvement to get to that city

2649
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:49,400
Some energy that can transform it from negative to positive and so on

2650
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:50,680
That

2651
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:54,260
At present, some scientists think of a stream like black grass

2652
02:00:54,260 --> 02:00:55,800
such a strong current

2653
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:58,880
Can it also be partially converted into electricity?

2654
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,120
but these are watching

2655
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,600
stage of planning

2656
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:06,080
So these issues are indeed technological challenges

2657
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:09,400
I can only say this now

2658
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:12,000
ok that time is up

2659
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:16,480
We are very grateful to Director Wu for his wonderful speech

2660
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:21,600
I will also take him to invite you to visit him at National Taiwan University another day

2661
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:26,920
The Department of Meteorology of National Taiwan University came out of that Gongguan MRT station.

2662
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:28,840
About 100 meters away

2663
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:31,560
There, the vicinity of Lu Mingtang is very beautiful

2664
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:33,280
You can play with him

2665
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:34,880
Okay, we thank Director Wu
