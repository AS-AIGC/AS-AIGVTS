【music】

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
good welcome

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Thank you for participating in this month's quiz

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Today our leader is

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Researcher Zhao Guangyu

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Is a researcher at the Institute of Employment and Life Support

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Dr. Zhao is a member of the National Central University Job Research Institute

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Graduate Master

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
PhD

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
PhD

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Zhuo Shi

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Sui Shi and Zhuo Shi are there

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Then go to the Union Campus of the University of California

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is the Riverside campus

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Dr. Duke Read

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Got a doctorate degree in occupational science there

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Washington State University

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
it's seattle

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Bouman does Postal

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Then

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,720
in molecular biology

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,960
Should be biochemistry

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,000
During this process, I have always been interested in the study of plants

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,800
Returned to Zhongyuan Hospital in 1999

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:19,000
Joined the Phytomachine Microbiology Institute team

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,720
it is now a researcher at the institute

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,640
And the deputy director

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,800
director here

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,120
yes we are

30
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,520
The Botanical Sanitation Institute belongs to the Central Plains

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,760
In the life sciences, it is the first

32
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,040
Yes, the land here used to be the land of the Botanical Guard

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,960
our side too

34
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,280
Later, it was given to us by us, it seems like this

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,800
right

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,080
So its research work in plant reproduction

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,520
There are many studies on the process of growth

38
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,520
have very good grades

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Today he will share with us

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It is using genetic technology

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
To understand the growth process of plants

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
OK, then we welcome Dr. Zhao Guangyu

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you, Vice President Liu, for your introduction

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
first of all i want to thank you

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I would also like to thank the secretary of the headquarters for giving me this opportunity

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let me share with you the past period of time that we have

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
in botany

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Especially the research on the reproductive growth of plants

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
More importantly, thank you all for coming today

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
i know tonight

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're probably all going to class

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
come back later

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I try to keep this content from being too old

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So this time we start today

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Basically, our laboratory mainly does

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
reproductive growth of plants

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And that's what I've always been interested in

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Before we introduce plant reproductive growth

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let me introduce you first

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
There is a typical plant cell

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
plant cells and animal cells

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The biggest difference is

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
it has leaves

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
it has cell arms

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and most importantly

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
it has a large cell in the middle

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
vacuoles of cells

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
In addition there are many

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
protoplasmic contact wire

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So this plant cell

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Can communicate with another plant cell

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Through this protoplasmic connecting thread

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
They can directly communicate with each other

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The structure of the whole plant cell

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We can learn from molecules, loads, entrained gas

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
cells all the way up to the whole plant

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
leaf filter

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
They end up forming leaf filters

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The leaf filter is an air pocket inside the plant

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Leaf filter eventually it will become

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
mesophyll cell

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Post-leaf cells can shape light and function

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
finally forming a leaf

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This is a construction of a whole plant

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Our genes for the whole inside of the plant

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
mutant strains

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You have a mutation in a single gene

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Will affect the plant a lot of changes

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
For example, this is inside a tomato

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
a gene that you overexpress

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
like this gene it controls the leaves

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and leaflet development

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It turned out to be like this

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
you can make it like this

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Therefore, through such a control

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
to express to change a plant's

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The pattern of growth and even its function

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We all know planting

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
All kinds of planting

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In fact, I also caught it from the Internet, and I don't know much about it.

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The only thing I saw was this kind of osmanthus seeds

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Other various plantings

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Planting is an important part of plants

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why is it other than family reception

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It is also a food for many animals

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But the whole crop produces

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Must have very successful reproductive growth

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So our content today

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I will divide it with you and you into these

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
First, let me tell you about the reproductive system of plants

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The second one I will introduce to you

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
In the past twenty years we have

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
There is something new about the development of a molecular biology cytology tool

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So how do we use these

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
we can explore

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Some questions we may not have been able to explore before

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Finally, I will share with you our research work

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This is a reproduction of the whole angiosperm

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
a life history

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Angiosperms differ from other plants in that

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
generations of its counterparts

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Generations of so-called monoquilts

123
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
very very short

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
For example, this is the male reproductive organs

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
female reproductive organ male is anther

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Then the female word is

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
match it in the fat

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Then when the anther goes through a split

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
produce pollen

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
androgenic plant

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So its implant body stage

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
just a very short time

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,600
Then the embryo sac of the embryo pig

134
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,100
It is the body of the partner

135
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,400
it has eggs in it

136
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,700
and finally

137
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,400
When there is a so-called thin powder effect

138
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,100
pollen hall

139
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,200
From this pollen will be produced the pollen hall

140
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,900
Finally put it two fine packages

141
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,900
Sent to embryonic pigs to complete double lean muscle

142
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,600
it's a whole process

143
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,500
The last skinny egg

144
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,400
it will continue to develop into a planting

145
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,600
This is a life history of the whole plant

146
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,000
so in

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,100
let's introduce

148
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,400
whole plant reproductive system

149
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,800
I will probably split it into two parts

150
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,100
introduce to you

151
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,200
The first is the sexual reproductive organs of plants

152
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,800
It is the growth and differentiation of flower teeth

153
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,900
For example, flower formation and structure

154
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,800
Huaya's clones and flower organs

155
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,200
The second one will introduce to you

156
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,300
The so-called lean powder effect of plants

157
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,900
these partners

158
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,700
For example, pollen and the formation of embryonic pigs

159
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,100
There is also the effect of the whole thin powder

160
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,200
So it's a process of selfing

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Wait a minute and you'll know there's something good if you see me

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I want to introduce you to one

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
This is an experimental material we made

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
called the Arab world

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Arab world

166
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's what we say in terms of our plants

167
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
so-called model plants

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
like fruit flies or mice

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
or ant ants

170
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
These are model plants

171
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
but we plant

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
we are basically arabian

173
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
why it is

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
its economy is very small

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The second its sequencing is done

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The third

177
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Because all the scientists all over the world

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
use this as plant material

179
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So there are quite a few resources

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
or Internet information

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
you can find

182
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Another one is

183
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
it has many of us now

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
so-called insertion with TDNA

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
mutants

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
it's okay i'll wait

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What is TDNA insertion?

188
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
There are other mutants

189
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So when we have a mutant strain of this gene

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We know which gene it plugged in

191
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
we see what it does

192
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We can probably infer the function of this gene

193
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So genes get from this information

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So let it be over the past few years

195
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
about ten years

196
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It makes a very nice plant material

197
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We can study the genes of plants

198
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
participate in the development of, for example, pollen

199
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Or bear the growth of graft

200
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
even pollination and seed growth

201
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
For a long time what we called

202
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We all know that DNA is our genetic material

203
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's a gene it makes a Mason

204
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Rapidly follow RNA and finally become protein

205
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
However, in past research we can find

206
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
maybe it's not that simple

207
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Possibly RNA could also be a genetic material

208
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
For example, our teacher Lin Nazhen

209
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The so-called headquarters he discovered

210
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Bamboo coelovirus

211
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
it is RNA

212
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
but it can be reversed into DNA

213
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Then turn into RNA and donate into protein

214
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This is a

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Another current study found that the so-called

216
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Generics related to production

217
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
none of your genes will change

218
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
you may see through your

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
change your DNA

220
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
fake plan

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
or something in your DNA

222
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
protein with it

223
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
False project of binding protein

224
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Or use sexual expression to control

225
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
gene expression

226
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So it's not just us anymore

227
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It is common to think that such a situation

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This is probably a cartoon

229
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The picture can tell you about

230
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
how does the gene go

231
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Execute and command

232
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Each of these is based on human genes

233
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
it has a nucleus

234
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
cell nucleus in plant

235
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Another is the plant nucleus

236
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Chromosomes inside

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What about each of our chromosomes

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You see, this is equivalent to

239
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
the whole gene it winds a

240
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
A protein called Histone

241
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This is the DNA

242
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
DNA coils with

243
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
these inherited messages

244
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
we can call it gene

245
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It then acts via detour

246
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
it seems a little slow

247
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
that has a protein

248
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It does this thing called DNA RNA polymerase

249
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
it opens up this genetic structure

250
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Then started doing some messenger RNA

251
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Then the messenger RNA of these messages

252
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
then start doing it slowly

253
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It is a way to use ATGC to pair with each other

254
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
to allow it to produce a message RNA like this

255
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
These last message RNA

256
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and then at the end it goes through some chopping

257
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
called messenger RNA

258
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
After the final cut

259
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
it will start sending to the cytoplasm

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This is what it is in this cell

261
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
it cuts some

262
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
put some unwanted things

263
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Or we call intron to remove it

264
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Finally turned into a function with

265
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It travels from the nucleus to the cytoplasm

266
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Then in the cytoplasm it will be called by a

267
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
ribexon the concrete

268
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,040
These two electric machines

269
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,400
Then it's called Rapidzone

270
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,340
This is a ribose base structure

271
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,320
your message it goes along this

272
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,200
The ribose base is right along the top

273
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,160
there are different things

274
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,320
Will put these Transfer RNA above

275
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,840
have brought a special IG nucleic acid

276
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,360
It will recognize every Code

277
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,880
In this way, a protein is finally formed

278
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,720
it's a whole process

279
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,800
so i think

280
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,880
So the growth of the sexual biomass of the whole plant

281
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
development we want to say

282
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,280
The first is to introduce

283
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,840
flowering of plants

284
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,920
its whole bloom

285
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,520
still formed

286
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,840
whole plant regulator

287
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,240
probably the flowering of the plant

288
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,640
by two main factors

289
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,680
an intrinsic factor

290
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,080
It means that plants must reach a certain stage

291
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,560
like all animals

292
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
must be mature

293
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,360
it can bloom

294
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,280
For example, these processes have gene expression for flowering

295
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,720
or hormonal control

296
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,520
Another external factor

297
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
For example, to have

298
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Length, such as photoperiod

299
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
or a low temperature

300
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The so-called vernalization effect

301
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The vernalization effect is mainly in the 1st and 2nd year

302
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
what about a plant

303
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It must undergo a low temperature treatment in seedlings

304
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
later its plants will bloom

305
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
throughout this process

306
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
From this picture you can find

307
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Whether it's biological clock, photoperiod, growth and delivery

308
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Finally, these messages will be

309
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
are concentrated in a few major ones

310
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
gene above

311
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
controlled by these genes

312
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Flower formation throughout the plant

313
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The development of the whole flower is probably from

314
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
the whole top the whole top of the branch

315
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
All top inflorescence clones

316
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
it will form this flower tooth clone

317
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That is Flameris etc.

318
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
this is the inflorescence

319
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Then this is the clone with flower teeth

320
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Then grow with infinity

321
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
For the branches of that plant

322
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Its flower teeth are basically limited growth

323
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,800
when this place forms a flower

324
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,000
it stops growing

325
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,200
So in the end, different flower vessels will be formed

326
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
like, say, primitive cells

327
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,800
Finally there are the primitive cells of this flower organ

328
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,200
finally form the whole flower

329
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,400
The structure of this flower is probably like this

330
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Let's talk about the model plant in the Arabian world

331
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
It has about four from the outside to the inside

332
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,800
There are four flowers

333
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
then there are four petals

334
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,000
But there are six stamens in the middle

335
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,800
Finally in the middle are two fused cores

336
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,200
it's a typical

337
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
everyone remember

338
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
wait a minute it will have a little quiz

339
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,600
little quiz

340
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
tell everyone

341
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,200
Genes involved in flowering flower buds

342
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,600
For example, this gene that controls flower bud formation

343
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,000
There are two clones and flowers

344
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,000
then or bowl

345
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,800
Bowl control over fat development

346
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,600
And how do we know which genes

347
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,400
control the whole process

348
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,600
The most important thing is the mutant strain we just talked about

349
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
When you have a mutation in one of your genes

350
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,720
You can find that the shape of the flower has changed

351
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
For example, it has more stamens

352
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,120
or more petals

353
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,520
you know the gene

354
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,600
presumably involved in the process

355
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,240
So many scientists

356
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,920
After slowly accumulating

357
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,120
By now we probably know that there are

358
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,520
This is the whole Arab world

359
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,360
From planting all the way to the whole flower

360
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,200
this way of planting

361
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,320
such as controlling flower buds

362
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,280
you don't want to go

363
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,560
you just go to the Internet to check

364
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,480
probably many

365
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,200
Basically two types

366
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,800
The first is to promote the formation of flower bud differentiation tissue

367
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,680
For example like LIFI

368
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,880
or AP2

369
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,160
these things

370
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,360
these genes

371
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,360
Another one that maintains the flower buds into tissue

372
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,560
Let's say this is the Arab world

373
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,720
traditional one normal phenotype

374
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,520
But you help you with a gene called LIFI

375
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,720
when like a leaf

376
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,320
it was originally supposed to be where the flower was

377
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
it becomes like a leaf

378
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,800
So you know why it's called LIFI

379
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,640
LIFI is like a leaf

380
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
flower tooth formation

381
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Also, for example, this

382
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
When you find out with another

383
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
it should stop flowering in this place

384
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But with Dang LIFI and another

385
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
they keep growing

386
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So you say that when these two genes can

387
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
just under control

388
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This place should form a flower later

389
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
should stop

390
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But when these two genes are mutated

391
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
it can keep growing

392
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Another one like Terminal Flower

393
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That is to say, the gene

394
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It just mutates there

395
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
there will be no such flowers

396
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
so this is a whole you can go and see

397
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
the first one so this is the control flower tooth

398
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But what about after the flower teeth are born?

399
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
there will be flowers

400
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
flower organ

401
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
have a model

402
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Called ABC model

403
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
is very famous

404
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
look at

405
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
A gene controls the second round

406
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
flower vessel formation

407
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
A gene alone controls the first round

408
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The B gene controls the formation of the second and third rounds

409
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
flower vessel formation

410
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
C gene controls third and fourth rounds

411
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
flower vessel formation

412
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
A gene alone controls the fourth round

413
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Resist each other

414
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
who can understand

415
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
probably many do not understand

416
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But people use scientists to use this way

417
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
oh

418
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
A gene alone controls the first round

419
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
then B gene

420
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
B gene controls the first and second rounds

421
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
second round

422
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So use something like this

423
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
a mechanism for this

424
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Then the C gene alone

425
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Control is the fourth round

426
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Xiong Rui

427
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But the A genes neutralize each other

428
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
That is, when the C gene is broken

429
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
it occupies

430
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Gene A came running

431
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Occupies the position of the A gene

432
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
remember

433
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
ok let's take the test now

434
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
There will be prizes in the exam

435
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This is what I was looking for today

436
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
please us yesterday

437
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
An administrator, Tingyu, he did it

438
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This is when our campus is open

439
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,960
Shi Hulan's organization seconds

440
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,120
guessed right

441
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,680
Answer the question correctly

442
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,560
Okay, let's see when the A gene is mutated

443
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,960
what will happen to it

444
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,600
so tell who can raise their hand

445
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,400
tell me what the first round turns out to be

446
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,600
what happens in the first round

447
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,120
good

448
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,120
ok so what will it be

449
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,320
Xiong Rui, Ci Rui, right?

450
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,040
Okay, the second one, you raised your hand, you have to finish it

451
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
What about the second round?

452
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,560
What is BC gold, what will mutual pursuit be

453
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,080
BC Jin Xiongrui at any time, right?

454
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,080
You have to tell me Xiongrui, Cirui, flower petals

455
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,080
What about the third one?

456
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,720
good great fourth

457
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,720
Okay, so if you don't know what it grows like

458
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,160
So this is such a plant

459
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,640
Come on, Mr. Zhou, please help me to give it to him

460
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,440
Okay, so you can find the words where the petals should be

461
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,040
it is now xiong rui

462
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,000
So you can't tell it's not quite a flower at all

463
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,760
We have A B C three golds and two chances

464
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,760
The second one, does anyone know when B gold has a mutation?

465
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,640
what happens in the first round

466
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Hurry up, it's beautiful

467
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,400
It's been a long time today and it's blooming

468
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,520
Hands up, what's the first round?

469
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,400
good second round

470
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,880
third

471
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,080
Xiong Rui

472
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,880
Fourth, well, I'll give you another chance

473
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Cirui good

474
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,040
OK this is the flower you think it looks like a flower

475
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
come to you

476
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
good third

477
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
last chance sorry

478
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
only one left

479
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Advertise our position willing to open

480
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
every year there will be this

481
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Welcome to our office next year

482
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
you can get it, you can get it

483
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Not getting it, it may take a little EVER to change it

484
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
good third suck

485
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
When Sucking Mutations

486
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What would be the mutation A

487
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
what's the first one at least raise your hand

488
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
good

489
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
flower two are you sure

490
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What about the second one?

491
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Let's see what it looks like

492
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
it's cool there are flowers in flowers

493
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,680
If you are running the original hydraulic power at home today

494
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,880
Then you want to pre-summary

495
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,480
This would be a great plant material

496
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,080
Why

497
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,480
it can only be bought like you

498
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,080
you don't produce seeds

499
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,920
but there are flowers in your flowers

500
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,960
isn't it beautiful

501
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,080
it's a pretty good one

502
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,360
So this is the ABC gene

503
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,640
But scientists never give up

504
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,040
never satisfied

505
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,040
they think so

506
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,240
Because after you mutate all the ABC genes

507
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,080
but put it all in the plant

508
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,840
everyone has performance

509
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,680
you didn't turn it into a flower

510
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,400
later they found out

511
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,080
BC gene

512
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,600
when it's going to work

513
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,200
they will find

514
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,840
There is another group of genes

515
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,400
called SEP-123

516
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,760
These three genes are very similar

517
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,440
they are going to work together

518
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,640
When your three genes

519
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,840
After SEP-123 is mutated

520
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,560
The whole plant will turn into a flower evil

521
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,760
so they finally know

522
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,000
at this place

523
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,720
In fact, the role of the BC gene

524
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,800
need to use

525
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,400
Involvement of the E gene

526
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,920
So they thought it was a very important

527
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,720
For example, this is a normal flower in the Arab world

528
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,000
This is a mutation in the E gene

529
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
you take it apart we say outside in

530
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,400
four flowers two

531
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,400
four petals

532
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,600
six stamens

533
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,640
The ratio of two fused hearts

534
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,360
But you can find that it looks exactly like Hua Er

535
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,520
This looks a lot like a mutation in the BC gene

536
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,840
so they know

537
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,480
The BC gene must be together with the E gene in the future

538
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,280
they only use

539
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,360
so you can see that it's not just a morphological change

540
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,880
When your gene is mutated

541
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,440
on our exterior

542
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,720
You see we're using an electron microscope

543
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,080
Look at the electron microscope

544
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,960
In normal Wildtide

545
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,280
normal bead words

546
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,640
Its flowers look like they have blowholes on them

547
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,440
it's green

548
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,560
You can find that it has pores for photosynthesis

549
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,960
Its petal shape is like this

550
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
but when you

551
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,300
When a gene is mutated

552
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,800
you look like flower even in the petals

553
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,700
So you're not only a waigan change

554
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,200
You change even its very nature

555
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,600
So in the end people are now

556
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,000
There is a called ABCE Model

557
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,800
For example, for the first one this time, you want to control the second petal of the flower

558
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,400
You need the ABCE gene to make different combinations

559
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,200
I don't think there is any need to remember this.

560
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,300
But that is to say it has a

561
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,900
So is there something else involved?

562
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,500
Yes

563
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Because there are still people in the land and land area who have discovered

564
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,700
Others may have other proteins involved

565
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,700
for example

566
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,800
When your other gene is mutated

567
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,300
You know why it's called Superman

568
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,500
Because it has a lot of stamens

569
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,400
When your Superman gene mutates

570
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,300
Its stamens will increase

571
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,300
Or if you look at this, it has

572
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,300
it will have excessive flowering

573
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,100
Like this one we just should have a normal flower with

574
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
four petals

575
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,100
You can find it this florescence this

576
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,720
have changed

577
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,000
even this doesn't look like a flower at all

578
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,360
So this is all made of these mutant beads

579
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,760
research we can

580
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,800
we accumulate

581
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,200
we can slowly know

582
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,680
How do these genes get involved

583
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,720
the whole flower

584
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,200
Differentiation and development of flower buds

585
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,320
Even the formation of flower organs

586
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,600
the role they play

587
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,200
In fact, there is quite a lot of space

588
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,840
For young students who are interested

589
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,320
or other interested

590
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,640
and a big one

591
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,680
A space for research and development

592
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,560
The second one I will introduce to you

593
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,680
the so-called pollination of plants

594
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,120
What we can talk about first is the so-called configuration body

595
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,000
Formation of pollen exudation

596
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
pollination

597
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,600
and the mechanism of pollen tube growth

598
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,920
this is a whole plant

599
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,320
You can find from here to here

600
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,160
the most important is

601
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,200
diploid on this side

602
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,320
when you go through a deceleration split

603
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,520
your so-called

604
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,000
this is pollen

605
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
will form pollen

606
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Pollen mother cells make pollen

607
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
pollen tube

608
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
This is the last and this is the embryo

609
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The central cell will form a

610
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
so-called embryo sac

611
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
There are three anti-bamboo cells inside

612
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
a central cell

613
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
an egg

614
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Next to it are two saprophytic cells

615
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
this is the last

616
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
it's a whole

617
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
throughout the developmental process

618
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
how do you know this situation

619
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
because it's still the same

620
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Tubian Bamboo

621
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
so far

622
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
this is what we are talking about

623
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
In fact, you can see this in 2008

624
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
But over the past 10 years

625
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
more genes found

626
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But first with this

627
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
in the thoracic stamen

628
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You can find that the most important thing is

629
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
pollen mother cell

630
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And this big embryo

631
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Mother cells they go through like this

632
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
you can find

633
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
every gene

634
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
every process

635
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Here is a genetic mutation

636
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
will affect this

637
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
so we accumulate

638
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
We can know that

639
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
all these genes

640
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
in the middle of this whole process

641
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
role involved

642
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
you don't have to remember

643
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
because i can't remember

644
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
But on these files

645
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
can be found

646
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
but so later

647
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
let's do some more research

648
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,620
because we see what happens to this pollen at some stage

649
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,900
We can go back to the literature and think

650
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,720
It turned out that the gene was mutated

651
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,880
Is our gene a protein? Does it have any interaction with it?

652
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,080
we can make progress

653
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,420
So this is some of our information in that place

654
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,320
whole pollination

655
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,160
The whole pollination basically the pollination of plants is

656
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,080
Pollen is an extremely dry condition

657
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,200
When the pollen is ripening it dehydrates

658
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,400
it will have a dehydration

659
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,000
so the pollen falls on the stigma

660
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,800
The pollen then absorbs water on the stigma

661
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:45,160
But this process has to go through a lot of so-called cell-to-cell interactions

662
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,600
For example, in the plant kingdom, there is a thing called self-inferiority and credible

663
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,080
That is to say, your own pool core will repel

664
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:58,080
or keep yourself from pollen with the same genotype

665
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
One may be absorbing water on the stigma

666
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,760
self-ambiguity

667
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,800
But if it's inside the style

668
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
Let it grow to a certain stage

669
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Don't let it be long is ligand body

670
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,600
self ambiguous

671
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,800
I won't be there today

672
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Because the mechanism is very, very complicated

673
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,200
Finally the pollen hall will enter the style after the growth

674
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,600
Finally two packets of information will be

675
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,800
Send to distribution to complete double collection

676
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,600
Throughout this process you may have

677
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,200
There are bee plum blossoms or insect plum blossoms

678
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
You can take the pollen with you

679
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,600
When the last pollen is on the stigma

680
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
it will generate a

681
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,600
This is the epidermis of the stigma

682
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
That epidermal cell that produces pollen tubes

683
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Eventually the pollen hall will grow inside the style

684
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
This is the practice style

685
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
you can look under a microscope

686
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,600
You go dye a special thing called

687
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,600
dye

688
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
you can see

689
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Every growth is a pollen hall

690
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,600
These little bits are called Kalus Pluck

691
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
It's the pollen hall that keeps growing

692
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
in the middle

693
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
It keeps forming structures like this

694
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
only let

695
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,400
The tip of the pollen is alive

696
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,960
That place brings two exquisite

697
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,120
I once did an experiment

698
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,560
After losing weight

699
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,760
you put that stigma

700
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,800
And part of the pollen style is removed

701
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,800
as long as you keep the topmost pollen structure intact

702
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,400
it last it doesn't need

703
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,440
have used those pollen tubes or

704
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,800
Thin Gold

705
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,120
you turn it upside down

706
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,640
It can still grow slower

707
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,280
because of this kind of place

708
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,640
But you can still lose gold

709
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,000
so you know it's a very

710
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,400
Active means magnetic sharp

711
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,280
will send a message

712
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,160
Attracts pollen tubes to my kind

713
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,200
This is a hollow style

714
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,440
For example like we have

715
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,120
One of our experimental materials

716
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,240
Iron Cannon Lily

717
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,840
You can spot these pollen tubes

718
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,600
grows along the inner epidermal cells

719
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,120
Pollen tubes are what we just talked about

720
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,440
this tip

721
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,400
what you see under the tip microscope

722
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,800
The previous one is a

723
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,200
just very very

724
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,800
seems to be a clean place

725
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,880
seen under a microscope

726
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,240
It is a lot of different packages

727
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,560
in this whole structure

728
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,240
last this

729
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,160
This pollen hall is constantly being formed

730
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,500
The so-called Kelas Park

731
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,500
take this pollen house

732
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,500
So in the end you just need this place to finish

733
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,300
Take it today to put the last two gold cells

734
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,400
to that pool

735
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,700
Match pigs to complete double insemination

736
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,300
So the last two gold cells

737
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,300
This pollen shop will deliver

738
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,300
This place is called the pig hole

739
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,200
complete fertilization

740
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,700
For example, this is one percent of our iron pack

741
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,000
You can find out if you look hard enough

742
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
This is a pig hole, this is an embryonic pig

743
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
this is fat

744
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
you can discover a pollen house

745
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
just go in from here

746
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,500
So throughout the

747
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,000
Speaking of the double fertilization of plants as a whole

748
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
probably

749
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,500
so a pollen house

750
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
last middle gold

751
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,000
Pollen hall is the bear plastosome

752
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,500
Its purpose is to combine two gold cells

753
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,500
sent to this embryo sac

754
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Embryo sac should be double fertilized

755
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
one of them will follow

756
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,500
egg is soft fertilization

757
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,800
double fertilization

758
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,280
a sperm will follow it

759
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,920
In addition, it will follow this polar cell

760
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,760
cell center

761
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,880
The two poles in the central cell

762
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,600
complete fertilization

763
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,040
So how much is 1 plus 1 equal to an egg?

764
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,840
2 is 2n

765
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,560
But in the end this central cell

766
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,440
What will this fertilized central cell form

767
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,240
breastfeeding

768
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,720
So the seed of the plant is very special

769
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,480
it belongs to 3n

770
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,800
so it is triploid

771
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,680
So this is a very special construct

772
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,960
And finally after this fertilized egg

773
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,400
It will eventually go through a series of fetal development

774
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,040
will generate interval

775
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,560
the last seed formed

776
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,120
The following is probably

777
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,720
How to grow the high efficiency of this cartoon

778
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,360
a pollen tube

779
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,600
Inside the pollen tube are two sperm cells

780
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,360
will go in along the bead hole

781
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,720
There should be a bead hole in it

782
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,240
from one of the two so-called saprophytic cells

783
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,240
destroyed

784
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,840
So in the end one of the sperm cells

785
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,400
will follow this soft cell

786
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
complete fertilization

787
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,760
form what is called a Zygote

788
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,120
is to receive nuclei

789
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,720
This is rotten cell

790
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,120
Rot cells, this is pink cells

791
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,560
So one of them will follow it

792
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,440
Also this is a central cell that has a collection

793
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,280
The central cell communicates with it

794
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,200
So far, probably the above three are called antipodal cells

795
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,880
as far as I know

796
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,280
now it must be working

797
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,400
Just like everyone has a length

798
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,880
People think that Mangchang is nothing

799
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,720
but found

800
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,400
May now find out that Mang Chang actually

801
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,880
In fact, it has some functions

802
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,440
I don't know what it does

803
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,920
It's just that people say it's useful

804
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,600
So I guess the three antipodal cells

805
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,120
It's not clear what effect

806
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,640
So it's probably over

807
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,440
Finally this will form the so-called Peyru

808
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,120
This will form the so-called Pey

809
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,000
This is a photo of the whole

810
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,080
Gum plant

811
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,240
plant glue

812
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,800
We just talked about the ones with stone cores

813
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,120
For example, like our so-called Arab world

814
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,560
or hollow

815
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,960
This is Iron Cannon Baihe

816
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You can find this is them these pollen houses will go along this

817
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So in the middle of the pollination process?

818
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
From the whole stigma pollen falling on the stigma to being completely fat

819
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Embryo pigs look throughout and find that there are two pollen halls in the middle of the process

820
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Two shop terms means one

821
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
it's like we're going home today

822
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
you are now on freeway

823
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
When you get to the freeway, you see

824
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
i live in taoyuan

825
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I saw Taoyuan

826
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm leaving home

827
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
right

828
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
out of the house

829
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
you want to go back to your car park

830
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
do you still have a term

831
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
so it's like finally he's going home

832
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So he has two shop terms

833
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
These two are very, very important

834
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And now scientists are researching that

835
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
in the middle of this whole process

836
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
A shop term is called funical

837
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It's a guiding for pig pie

838
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
pollen hall

839
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
it has to sense

840
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,060
message from the gametophyte

841
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,560
Told you that you were coming out of here

842
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,680
i'm here he's going in

843
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,720
The other one is from Zhukou

844
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,880
he will

845
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,680
So only two attract

846
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,640
for example

847
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,000
when you plant

848
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,920
Under normal conditions of this pollen

849
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,360
Every

850
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,680
AmbroSecPanel

851
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,480
Will only accept one pollen tube

852
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,680
so there will only be one pollen tube

853
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,040
along the bead handle

854
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,280
will enter the micropyle to complete the double release

855
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,320
When you plant this it doesn't matter

856
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,800
when holding the gametophyte

857
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,400
it's basically

858
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,640
Pollen will not recognize Signal

859
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,480
But other times when some plants mutate

860
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,440
For example called Marmut

861
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,920
when you do this it can

862
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,560
along the micropyle

863
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,040
To go along this Funicle is the bead handle

864
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,200
it can pollen tubes know where to come out

865
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,640
but it can't find a home

866
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
When this gene is mutated

867
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,240
You can find all the pollen tubes

868
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,440
can only go around outside

869
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,240
It can't find the micropyle of McPad

870
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,000
so you know the gene

871
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,080
When a mutation occurs, there are two

872
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,880
First

873
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,280
when your gene is mutated

874
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,120
Your pollen tube can't help

875
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,800
sense to this from Chirui

876
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,640
Embryo sac kidney out information

877
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,360
the second

878
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,960
Each of our original bead handles

879
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,360
only one pollen tube

880
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,360
You can find quite a few pollen tubes

881
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,320
so you know the role it's involved in

882
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
The messaging is in this section

883
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,960
In addition there is this mute

884
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,240
you can spot pollen tubes

885
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,680
Yes, the normal pollen tubes I just talked about

886
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,960
Go in from McPa

887
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,440
After this beadhole goes in

888
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,160
pollen tubes will burst

889
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,080
Exploding will release two gold pieces

890
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,280
but this you can find

891
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,320
When your gene mutates

892
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,560
Pollen tubes can go in along the stalk

893
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,080
Micropyretes can also be found

894
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,880
But it won't explode after it goes in

895
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,800
so you can know

896
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,080
The role of this gene

897
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,160
Eventually the pollen tube will burst

898
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
Release the two economic packages

899
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,120
So in this process there is quite a lot of

900
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,720
a study of

901
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,480
Only then can we know how the entire pollen tube is frightened

902
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,880
So now we're going to just ask

903
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,320
scientists are never satisfied

904
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,480
these molecules

905
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,760
pool core

906
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,800
Or these pool configuration bodies sent out by it

907
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,240
how did it come out

908
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,920
where did it come from

909
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,280
So there is a scientist who just use the tight

910
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,040
material of this plant

911
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,200
What's so special about this plant material?

912
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,280
it has a bare

913
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,880
embrane

914
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,400
the scientist

915
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,840
He's a pretty good guy

916
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,760
Their article was published in Science

917
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,520
what's so special about this plant

918
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,960
That is to say, it matches

919
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,760
We used to pack this bag in it.

920
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,080
but this one it's all exposed

921
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,120
After you separate the accessory sac

922
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,080
put it on your garnish

923
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
You put it in the pollen hall

924
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
you can find

925
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
This is the so-called Mike Pie

926
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's pig's mouth

927
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
you can find

928
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
This is the pollen hall that grows outside the body

929
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
will naturally run in

930
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
complete fertilization

931
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
you can find

932
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Enter through the middle of the two rotting spiders

933
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
it completes fertilization

934
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
They found a system like this

935
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
so he wants

936
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
This is a very good system

937
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
at least we know

938
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
embryo sac

939
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
There are two rot lizards inside

940
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
a central cell

941
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
one more egg

942
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And the above three anti-bamboo cells

943
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
three anti-bamboo cells

944
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
maybe too far

945
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
they got here

946
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
At least we just look at the following

947
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I went in with the pollen house

948
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
The carrion is more important

949
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
eggs are more important

950
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
or the central cell is more important

951
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So they made a

952
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
very interesting experiment

953
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
controlled by laser

954
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
look

955
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
They can use a combination of laser and microscope

956
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It can be destroyed with great precision

957
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
One of the

958
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
i can destroy

959
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Between the two rot packs

960
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,280
Destroy this Centro cell

961
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,400
or two rotten cells

962
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
You destroy it with one hit of the laser

963
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,600
So you use various permutations

964
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,800
Destroys the morphology of various cells

965
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,600
You can make a result like this

966
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,200
i can destroy a cell

967
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,600
destroy two cells

968
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
destroy three cells

969
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,800
various combinations

970
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,000
We look at it for the whole ability to attract pollen tubes

971
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,200
Will it be affected

972
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,600
So in the end they found

973
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,000
a fun one is

974
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,800
when you find out

975
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,800
You just need a rotten cell

976
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,800
Next to it are the two cells next to the soft

977
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,200
As long as one rotten cell is broken

978
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,400
It's basically the ability to attract pollen tubes in

979
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,200
just lower

980
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,000
Once you help put these two rotten cells

981
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,600
when completely destroyed

982
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,200
Pollen tubes do not enter

983
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,800
so what do they know

984
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,600
This signal is sent from two rotting cells

985
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,600
you also know never enough

986
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,400
directly after ten years

987
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,000
they want to know what molecule

988
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So after 10 years they found

989
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
ok let's see

990
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
In this case I put this

991
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
They can since they are naked

992
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
This ambrosex this matching capsule

993
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
We'll just separate all the cells out of it

994
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
cells in which we can

995
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
All it can find is the synergy cell

996
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
put this synergy cell

997
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
go inside it protein law

998
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
found a group of proteins

999
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
This group of proteins is abundantly expressed

1000
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Then it finds the gene

1001
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
then antibodies

1002
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It can be found that it is really

1003
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
ambrosex in the pig hole

1004
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Then they did a cool

1005
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Is that the molecule

1006
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Really attracts pollen tubes to grow

1007
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
really

1008
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
when you are cultivating people

1009
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
you found click here

1010
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
you can find the pollen tube

1011
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
will reduce the growth in this place

1012
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So they found this

1013
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
defending like this protein

1014
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
is involved in this thing

1015
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
you can watch this grow

1016
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
you can watch this cool

1017
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It turns when it taps the pollen tube

1018
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
click it here again

1019
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
pollen tube turns

1020
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
so you know something like this

1021
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
it attracts pollen tubes

1022
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
That is, guide the growth of pollen tubes

1023
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
so this is a very interesting

1024
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
so in this

1025
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
This is under this tight this plant material

1026
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
they just

1027
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
we just found this

1028
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Is there any other molecular wild material?

1029
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Recently they also found

1030
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Arab world has similar

1031
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
but these

1032
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
In fact, what I want to tell you is a

1033
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Just now that is a dicotyledonous plant

1034
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
our monocots

1035
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Iron Lily

1036
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
iron lily this is a

1037
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
it has a hollow style

1038
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Then what

1039
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
We did an experiment

1040
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
we just want to say

1041
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
We hollow these styles

1042
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Since we want to attract pollen tubes to grow

1043
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It should be these things in the style

1044
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
should play an important role

1045
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
and we wanted to say

1046
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Pollen tubes grow a bit like animal cells

1047
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
especially in this

1048
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
so-called hollow pool

1049
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
The hollow style

1050
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
it is an attachment

1051
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
then grow on the move

1052
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
you just saw

1053
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So we developed a way like this

1054
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
We really found you this is Nitroceus Memes

1055
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
This is an artificial membrane

1056
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
When you coat this layer on the film

1057
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
When this star exits you take the pollen tube

1058
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
put the film on

1059
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
You can find that the pollen tube seems to be

1060
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
It's like a big foot extended like this

1061
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And finally we want to say

1062
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Indicates the substance inside

1063
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Possibly attached to pollen

1064
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and attract growth

1065
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
So after I graduated

1066
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
The teachers in my doctoral class will continue to have a Post-up

1067
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
he will remember

1068
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
From this, they use lust analysis

1069
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
A substance is separated from it

1070
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
You can find that when this substance

1071
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
what he did was very

1072
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
That girl's eyes are really amazing

1073
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
he's on this slope

1074
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Then dig a hole in the middle of this thing

1075
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
you put that thing you can put in

1076
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
you are variously purified

1077
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Different Purified Things

1078
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Then you take the pollen grains

1079
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
The benefits of Iron Cannon Lily are

1080
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Its pollen grains are super large

1081
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
it's super big

1082
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
you can see it with meat

1083
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Then it circles around the outside

1084
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
so that the pollen tube germination is all facing outward

1085
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
pick slowly with a needle

1086
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
If today this material

1087
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
can attract pollen tubes

1088
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
It will grow outward and grow in again

1089
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
if it is water

1090
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
it will grow wildly

1091
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So later it found

1092
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
really this thing

1093
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
it affects it

1094
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
and it's a protein

1095
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
When you, the stored substance

1096
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
after you add

1097
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
lost activity

1098
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Finally they found a

1099
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Cymocyanin

1100
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
it's a protein

1101
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So that means

1102
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
possibly among different species

1103
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
have different molecules

1104
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
or protein

1105
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
participate in this mechanism

1106
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
So I think this is a

1107
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
That means we're in the middle of the process

1108
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Now of course one after another

1109
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
students now

1110
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
their laboratory

1111
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
they talk

1112
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
ok we now know

1113
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
There is a general definition of Micropile

1114
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
What is the general definition of Funical?

1115
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
the other pollen tube

1116
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,800
to go all the way down from the casting head

1117
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,960
What is this long-distance signal?

1118
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,000
So scientists are never satisfied

1119
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,400
So they also try to

1120
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,520
I heard that I found it

1121
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,600
but not yet published

1122
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,920
We'd like to say that we'll probably know soon

1123
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,280
What molecules are attracted to this petal jar?

1124
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,000
All the way from the casting head along the style

1125
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,520
finally to the fat

1126
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,080
Embryo pig

1127
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,520
its growth

1128
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,760
so it's a process

1129
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:34,080
The next thing I want to tell you is that we have been here for about ten years

1130
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,400
Twenty or ten years

1131
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,640
Ten years?

1132
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
should be about the same

1133
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,600
I do Post-Auto there

1134
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,520
about ten years

1135
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,480
I'm sorry for twenty years

1136
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,120
some recent tools

1137
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,920
For example, we have long believed that

1138
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,400
You want to see the finer structure of the cell

1139
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,040
You're going to the electron microscope

1140
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,400
electron microscope

1141
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,040
right

1142
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,800
The light microscope has its one limit

1143
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,000
but in the past this

1144
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,400
In addition to a research and development of optical microscopes in recent years

1145
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,760
There is also the root of a technology called the digital camera

1146
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,400
We have something called a confocal optical microscope

1147
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,920
This makes the optical microscope

1148
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,440
FusionExcel's optical microscope seems to be reborn again

1149
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,760
an opportunity for regeneration

1150
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,600
The other one is that we now have really good computers

1151
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,200
works fast enough

1152
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,000
It is possible to process these images

1153
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,600
Then there are some fluorescent proteins

1154
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,400
Production of fluorescent substances

1155
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,600
Finally there is a laser system

1156
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,680
These three

1157
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,600
These four things finally make a

1158
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,000
We now have what's called a confocal microscope

1159
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Many research institutes now have

1160
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,480
What is the so-called confocal microscope

1161
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,240
Our Traditional Fluorescence Microscope

1162
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,720
its light source

1163
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,720
The message we received was like this

1164
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,200
but conjugate focus

1165
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,040
It can be said that it can use a computer to see

1166
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,600
so you can put your laser

1167
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,160
only on a certain layer

1168
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,080
it's yours it's yours

1169
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,920
This is your specimen of your plant

1170
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,400
You can only position in this collar

1171
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,320
or locate here

1172
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,600
you put other noise signals

1173
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,960
Use Filter to filter it out

1174
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,960
So what effect does it have

1175
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,760
This is the tradition we see

1176
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,160
Conventional Fluorescence Microscopy

1177
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:19,960
but you can see

1178
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,800
concord microscope

1179
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,760
Can make your image see more clearly

1180
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,320
Your image can be seen more clearly

1181
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,480
For example, we can in this

1182
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,280
You can see us using

1183
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,960
It can be at different delivery locations

1184
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,120
We can scan a pollen tube

1185
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,360
top to bottom

1186
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,000
you can go from top to bottom

1187
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,360
Finally, you can use the computer to combine

1188
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,720
a 3D construct

1189
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,960
for example

1190
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,560
This is an air port that our lab is working on

1191
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,800
it's arabian

1192
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,200
arabian world you can find

1193
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,360
Scanning TV mirrors seem to look like

1194
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,080
Give you cool 3D

1195
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,720
A bit of a 3D effect, right?

1196
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,000
This we also see the fluorescent representative

1197
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,280
How can the effect of generating electricity

1198
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,480
but

1199
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,040
You use

1200
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Very focal effect

1201
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,740
what effect can you give

1202
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,740
you can see

1203
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,240
you can scan

1204
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,300
you can swipe from top to bottom

1205
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,500
You can see that this is a stomata structure

1206
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,000
You can make the pores have a three-dimensional structure like this

1207
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,580
This is from top to bottom

1208
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,740
It's okay if you're not satisfied

1209
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,240
we can go from left to right

1210
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,200
you can see this blowhole

1211
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,500
These are two air pockets

1212
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,500
Then there is a hole in the middle

1213
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,200
where the gas can freely pass through

1214
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,800
you can side

1215
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,500
A microscope made like this from the side

1216
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,200
So this can be used quite a bit

1217
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,400
It's okay if you don't think it's enough

1218
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,000
We can do 3D

1219
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,200
You can use different

1220
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,700
You can make structures in 3D

1221
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
So you can combine it with

1222
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,200
you can scan different

1223
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,600
You combine all the images of this thing

1224
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,700
you can watch

1225
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,100
so you can see

1226
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,300
If your protein special Label is in a certain pair

1227
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,000
You can see your protein in

1228
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
this cell

1229
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,200
or a particular location inside the cell

1230
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,400
So you can push the function to heat it

1231
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,400
So this is a pretty interesting

1232
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,200
conventional microscope

1233
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,200
We can see that

1234
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,200
or by silver cursor

1235
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,400
or elevator microscope

1236
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,800
you can tell

1237
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,000
This seems to look fine detail

1238
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
but what

1239
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
They are all dead cells

1240
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,200
they are all

1241
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,200
you will want to say

1242
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,000
So what would it be like under the living body?

1243
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
So by one like this

1244
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So finally one of the things we found was

1245
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,400
silver light protein

1246
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,400
silver light protein

1247
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,400
i think everyone knows

1248
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,400
We have a lot of news from before the network

1249
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,600
silver light fish zebrafish

1250
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,400
all kinds

1251
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,600
It is mainly a silver light protein

1252
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,800
I used to find green

1253
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,800
red now

1254
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,200
various colors

1255
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,600
when your color

1256
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,400
When you are the appearance of silver light protein

1257
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,000
you can find

1258
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,600
assortment you can use on animals

1259
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,600
can be used on plants

1260
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,800
how it is used in plants

1261
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,000
For example, we can use the protein

1262
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Although we see stomata

1263
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,160
ovules you see

1264
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,200
This is the whole embryo

1265
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,200
This is the middle of the process of cell division we see

1266
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,000
A variation of imitation hammer wire

1267
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
or inside a plant leaf that we can get

1268
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,400
do so-called Potoplas

1269
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,000
Then we can do some analysis

1270
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Ours is, for example, this is

1271
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,200
This is the chloroplast

1272
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,200
we can do many many things

1273
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,000
others you can see

1274
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,200
like a cytoskeleton

1275
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,000
Cytoskeleton Sidere Scalata

1276
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
You can find this is

1277
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,600
This is the fresh hair on the surface of the leaf

1278
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,400
you can see these cytoskeletons

1279
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,400
how do you form such a construct

1280
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,400
the one we just talked about

1281
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Can see Live Image

1282
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,400
This is a Live Image

1283
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,400
You can see that its Label is imitation hammer wire

1284
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,400
Microtubule

1285
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,400
you can find

1286
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,400
you see the cells are dividing

1287
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,400
you can see

1288
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,400
right in front of your eyes

1289
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,400
you can see living cells

1290
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,400
Live Whole Your Gene Bomber

1291
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,400
the whole change

1292
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,400
Although I think it's a

1293
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,400
for us is a

1294
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,400
very useful tool

1295
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,400
Is it useful?

1296
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,400
So we are now saying

1297
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,400
Both these tools

1298
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
what we couldn't do before

1299
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
For example, before we could only say

1300
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
whip out a protein or something

1301
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Now you can use fluorescent subtraction to mirror

1302
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
we use some way to turn straight

1303
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
We can see these cells in living

1304
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
even you can see the little cytoplasm

1305
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Inside the Cytoskeleton of Matter Research

1306
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
running in and out

1307
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
wait till we have one

1308
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
A video to introduce to you

1309
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Then our laboratory research is mainly

1310
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Some genes involved in the sexual biomass of plants

1311
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Same

1312
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
This is the life of the whole plant

1313
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Our main thing is

1314
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
The earliest our laboratory

1315
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I'm personally interested in pollen

1316
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Because I think pollen is really a

1317
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
very cool

1318
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Why

1319
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
it is a cell

1320
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
it has its own cell box

1321
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
we call nutrition box

1322
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
But inside this cell

1323
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
two more gold cells

1324
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
So it is an extremely degenerate

1325
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
a bear configuration

1326
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
but it's a cell box

1327
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
so it can be done

1328
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Pretty good for a cytology

1329
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
study one

1330
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Then in the past and later, in the past few years in the future, we will slowly expand

1331
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
We found that some of the research we did started to lead to the so-called configuration

1332
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
The development of the male and female gametes

1333
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
In the end, we also found that something to do with the seeds

1334
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So we all revolve around the reproductive growth of so-called plants

1335
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
For the past few years we have used

1336
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
We want to be able to study certain genes or proteins

1337
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
How to participate in so-called male gametes or pollination

1338
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
or the process of so-called embryonic development

1339
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
We used iron cannon lily rice and Arabian circles as materials

1340
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
But let me introduce to you today

1341
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
We have spent the past few years in Iron Cannon Lily

1342
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Iron Lily

1343
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Why did we use Iron Cannon Lily in the first place?

1344
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
You go and see

1345
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
This is the anther of the iron cannon lily

1346
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
The small and pitiful one next to it is the flower of the Arabian world

1347
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You can find that its anthers are much larger than other people's flowers

1348
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
It's certainly a good material

1349
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Another one you can find

1350
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
it is a hollow style

1351
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,280
There are ways to collect so-called

1352
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,520
Pollen House at Invival

1353
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,520
The third we found

1354
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,120
its stigma

1355
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,600
it constantly secretes a

1356
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,760
sticky sticky stuff

1357
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,560
Our name is Stella Exde

1358
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,400
You can find this sticky down

1359
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,880
we can collect this

1360
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,560
we can find out

1361
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,080
Later this Stella Exde is very magical

1362
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,800
it has something in it

1363
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,920
When your pollen is placed at minus 20 degrees

1364
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,760
saved for 6 months

1365
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,120
Then you stop normally and take it out

1366
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,720
The efficiency of the pollen hall is very poor

1367
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,080
right? think about it

1368
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,240
Don't talk about people

1369
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:32,960
Pollen House, right?

1370
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,360
like a cell

1371
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,680
pollen grain

1372
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,440
But pollen like you

1373
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,360
stored pollen

1374
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,920
You add Stella Exde

1375
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,240
About 10% Stella Exde

1376
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,840
It restores the germination of pollen tubes

1377
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,160
So it's kind of like a rejuvenation effect

1378
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:48,880
so our laboratory

1379
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,480
interested in this too

1380
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,680
We Later We Now Lab

1381
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,480
We draw this Stella Exde

1382
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,800
We want to be able to Purify its molecule

1383
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,200
So we use the so-called

1384
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,200
Chromatic Analysis

1385
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,880
We have divided into different Fraction

1386
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,420
And one of the ones we found now

1387
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:06,260
These two freshers very much retain such activity

1388
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,620
And the molecules are now probably identified as well.

1389
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:12,000
just don't know what it is

1390
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,100
Its three-dimensional 3D structure is left-handed and right-handed

1391
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,500
Or does this molecule have other derivatives?

1392
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,160
We look a bit like a derivative of ancetonic acid

1393
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,000
But now we have to go further

1394
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Hope to be able to synthesize to test

1395
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,300
so this is where we are

1396
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,300
Because the pollen house I just talked about

1397
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,300
You see, the pollen hall can be used as

1398
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,300
basically what happens inside a cell

1399
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,300
So the message goes

1400
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,300
Cap ion goes in

1401
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,300
All of these are on the pollen pavilion

1402
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,300
so it is a very good as a material

1403
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,300
So let's say we have two graduate students

1404
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,300
high school student

1405
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,300
high school students they will one day

1406
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,300
They come to our laboratory

1407
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,300
He said he wanted to do a science exhibition, and I said yes.

1408
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,300
what do you want to do

1409
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,300
I want to say this is good for them to do

1410
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,300
you can find them found to do

1411
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,200
Finally, it was found that when the pollen tubes are in the middle of the process

1412
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,720
What happens to the oil in it

1413
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,240
changes in oil

1414
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,840
Later in fact we were before

1415
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,560
A few years ago we discovered that in plants

1416
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,480
We can use Iron Cannon Lily

1417
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,640
Although it is an iron cannon lily, although it cannot be genetically modified

1418
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,520
But scientists are still very powerful

1419
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,000
gene gun

1420
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,000
We take the proteins we find

1421
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,240
Then we code on an energy

1422
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,800
like say this is us

1423
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,600
Not sorry

1424
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,360
plasticizing

1425
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,200
a plastid

1426
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,440
have the genes we want

1427
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,040
Then we use the gene gun

1428
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,840
Hit this gene until after this

1429
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,360
Let's use comfoca to see

1430
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,160
so you can find

1431
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,120
iron lily

1432
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,000
you can find

1433
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,880
This protein can really express

1434
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,440
Then we have this one on the oil body

1435
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,360
Purified protein

1436
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,240
you can find

1437
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,280
As the pollen tube grows

1438
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,040
You can find these oil bodies

1439
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,880
really works constantly

1440
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,160
so we know real pollen tubes

1441
00:51:59,160 --> 00:51:59,960
at least we

1442
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,680
Later experiments also found

1443
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,840
When the whole pollen hall is covered

1444
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,400
There is a group of fats that change

1445
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,760
Another group of fat will increase

1446
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,160
May be involved in cell membrane growth

1447
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,200
Because the pollen hall grows it needs the cell membrane

1448
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,720
Constant supply of cell membrane

1449
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,880
those material

1450
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,480
So that might be the mechanism

1451
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,280
So we're in the middle of the process

1452
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,680
we also found a

1453
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,360
a so-called cytoskeletal protein

1454
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,400
It's called LIM

1455
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,440
Then we also did some experiments

1456
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,600
What are cytoskeletal proteins?

1457
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,520
it's a cartoon

1458
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,360
you can find

1459
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,440
this is the root of a plant

1460
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,120
this is the root of a plant

1461
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,000
Then they made genetically modified plants

1462
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,080
He found that this protein only had GFG fluorescence

1463
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,960
You can find it manifesting in root hairs

1464
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,200
You see and then they order

1465
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,080
it's all real

1466
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,120
The words below the back are cartoons

1467
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,800
that's what they found

1468
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,840
This is a cytoskeletal protein

1469
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,000
It should help you out of the so-called

1470
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Acting Weiss's A Knot

1471
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
What is the structure of these micro divisions that you finally found out

1472
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
it's...you can find it walking around

1473
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
It's these proteins it's an acid binding protein

1474
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
it has a nonspecies species on it

1475
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
You can find it can walk up and down on this

1476
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
So it's fun. This is the Western Gaogu religion.

1477
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
This is Sytle skeleton

1478
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
The thing we make doesn't go like this

1479
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
but also something like

1480
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So for example we find

1481
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
when normal in this pollen house

1482
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
We still use the gene gun to express

1483
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
You can find our protein

1484
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
it will follow the cytoskeleton

1485
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
It's F acting, it's the combination of micro-teachers

1486
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
But when you're dealing with this micro division's decomposing matter

1487
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
You can find that the combination is gone

1488
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Then when we do a lot of this performance

1489
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
you see it found

1490
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,600
When pollen tubes are abundant

1491
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,800
Originally normal growth pollen tube

1492
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,920
You will find that there is a middle pollen tube

1493
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,480
There will be a joint-like thing appearing at the tip

1494
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,640
Let's say you're like a normal pollen tube

1495
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,160
it grows like this

1496
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,200
it will keep growing

1497
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,440
But when your gene happens

1498
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,760
When you let this protein express in large quantities

1499
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,680
Pollen tube growth stops

1500
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,520
Then you can find that the pollen tubes grow

1501
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,040
In the middle of this process, there is a particularly bright

1502
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,080
Our protein creates a

1503
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,000
a so-called aggregation of thinking

1504
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,440
This will affect the pollen tube

1505
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,920
It will prevent the pollen tube from continuing to grow.

1506
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,760
So use this way

1507
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,520
we just know

1508
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,400
Our protein may be a Wisdom-binding protein

1509
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,640
it for it throughout the pollen tube

1510
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,400
It must go through the growth process

1511
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,680
very fine regulation

1512
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,480
so this is a

1513
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,840
Another one we just talked about

1514
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,680
A pollination of whole pollen

1515
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,680
we want to know

1516
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,340
How does pollen grow in the word dimension

1517
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,240
Because all of our current literature above

1518
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,040
All of us, like what we just said

1519
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,080
The Arab world has a lot of information on the Internet

1520
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:15,080
These are all from the incubator

1521
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,240
growing pollen hall

1522
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,380
then we were thinking

1523
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,640
The pollen hall grows inside the style

1524
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,080
why you can find out

1525
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,080
We grow in in vitro culture machine

1526
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,580
and internally grown pollen pavilions

1527
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,220
The first pollen pavilion grown inside the body

1528
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,420
grow very fast

1529
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,820
Iron Lily

1530
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:38,860
its from stigma to style to its fat

1531
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:41,060
The middle can be up to about 15 cm

1532
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:43,560
It can grow from head to tail in two days

1533
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,760
But the incubator you grow in vitro

1534
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,060
never last that long

1535
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,560
can't grow so fast

1536
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,260
The other one is in Iron Explosion Lily

1537
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:52,060
we can find out

1538
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,460
growing in the stylet

1539
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,060
it attaches to each other

1540
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,560
Not only attached to each other

1541
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,560
will also be tightly attached to the so-called

1542
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
emits a surface of this layer

1543
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
a cell called the epidermal

1544
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
so we were thinking

1545
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Is it growing in vitro or in vivo?

1546
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
the only difference

1547
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Teeth

1548
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Is it the one played by Gary?

1549
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
what kind of role

1550
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
because of some materials

1551
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
so there's been no way anyone would know

1552
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
these pollen tubes

1553
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
what's going on in the body

1554
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
so a few years ago

1555
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
we used a special method

1556
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
let's just let this

1557
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
We constructed a transplant pig material

1558
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
It uses pollen-specific proteins

1559
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
received a call

1560
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
ribosomal protein

1561
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Ribosomes, do you remember?

1562
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
At first, what I just said earlier

1563
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
from genes not most

1564
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
what messenger to use

1565
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
message messenger

1566
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
from the nucleus to the cytoplasm

1567
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
ribosome

1568
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
final protein

1569
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
the ribosomal protein

1570
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So we put this protein

1571
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
how about after showing

1572
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,480
Because if you think about it, all the genes are going to come from

1573
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,940
Gene to Messenger

1574
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,640
Messenger ends up in the ribosome

1575
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,040
So of course we our

1576
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,640
When ribosomes can be labeled

1577
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,040
Let's use Country again

1578
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:18,840
This ribosome can contain the incoming

1579
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,740
The message RNA precipitates it all together

1580
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:24,240
At this time we use this way

1581
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,800
What we can find is inside the style

1582
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,240
protein inside growing pollen tube

1583
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,940
And with a so-called

1584
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:35,240
Non-destructive we have something called Translator

1585
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,740
That is to say, some of the message RNA

1586
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:41,240
inside the pollen tube

1587
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:45,500
A message inside a growing pollen tube

1588
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,540
this we can find

1589
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,940
what kind of protein

1590
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,300
Which gene products of this process

1591
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,200
Also we can find

1592
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,840
This gene is really fun

1593
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,200
This is normal Wildtide

1594
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,240
you can spot a pollen tube

1595
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,840
Will only meet from a micro

1596
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
But when you some

1597
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
We find these genes

1598
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
to find its mutant

1599
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
its pollen tube

1600
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:13,000
The first pig's mouth that couldn't find Chi Rui

1601
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
or that it will pass through

1602
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
additional or multiple pollen tubes

1603
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
So this is basically

1604
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
when these are in the pollen

1605
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
gene generation

1606
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
when mutation

1607
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
The whole behavior of your pollen tubes

1608
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
changed

1609
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
another one

1610
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
A student from one of our most recent labs

1611
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
what he does is

1612
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
we found so many

1613
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
one of them

1614
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
this gene

1615
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
it is involved as well

1616
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Related to Raboson synthesis

1617
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
But when your gene mutates

1618
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
You can discover the structure of the entire pollen tube

1619
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
The structure of this cell currency

1620
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
or the inner cytoskeleton

1621
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
have changed

1622
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Finally, I would like to introduce to you a

1623
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
gene transfer technology

1624
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
We just talked about TDNA

1625
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,960
This is what we rely on, Mr. Ermin

1626
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,460
he is the expert

1627
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,300
Actually I don't really understand

1628
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,300
If you really want to change jobs on this

1629
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:07,960
go to him

1630
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,500
He must give you a very perfect answer

1631
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,160
But what kind of sex is this

1632
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,960
That is to say, we are in the plant of Agrobacterium

1633
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,360
this pathogen

1634
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,260
We found out that it has something called TiPlasma

1635
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,160
plastid

1636
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,660
This thing is very special

1637
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,560
We can do something on it

1638
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,160
do something

1639
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,840
This TiPlasma will eventually

1640
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,440
pinch pinch see first come

1641
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,300
will be delivered to the plant

1642
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,940
Then look inside the genes of the plants first

1643
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,000
top of gene body

1644
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
will then result in a

1645
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,700
It can make it grow and mutate

1646
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,040
can also

1647
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,200
Sew in

1648
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,100
Can cause a certain gene in the plant to be destroyed

1649
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:43,640
so we talk

1650
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,900
The TiPlasma mutant just mentioned

1651
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,640
Or you can make a gene

1652
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,100
massive performance

1653
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:55,000
This is one I found on the Internet

1654
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,000
It is TiPlasma

1655
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,460
You can put the gene you want

1656
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,260
put in

1657
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,160
then send it

1658
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,240
In this so-called concentrated bacteria

1659
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,880
Concentrated bacteria?

1660
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,760
Then you can use it to infect plants

1661
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,720
you can use it to infect plants

1662
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,480
What about after you infect the plant?

1663
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,360
this is a normal operation

1664
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,040
What about after infecting plants?

1665
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:17,280
This highly sensitive bacterium will use a special structure

1666
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,560
will put the so-called TiPlasma

1667
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,960
into the plant

1668
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,480
well you get infected

1669
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,800
The Ecopter is attached to the cell wall of this plant

1670
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,600
when it attaches to the plant cell wall

1671
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,080
What about this TiPlasma?

1672
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,880
it enters the cell

1673
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,640
then run to the cell wall

1674
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,440
Then the whole of your gene

1675
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,960
with this thing it carries

1676
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,400
You can shoot first in the whole gene's

1677
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,360
TiTiA will pick up here

1678
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:45,640
entire

1679
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,200
so you can make genes

1680
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,600
Genetic

1681
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,640
a destruction of

1682
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,760
So you might be causing what's called a mutation

1683
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,640
then you end up

1684
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,120
Previous words could be generated using

1685
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,200
tissue culture

1686
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,120
Then you from tissue culture can finally generate

1687
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,280
Then your tissue culture

1688
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,800
Your DNA has a

1689
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,560
For example, the volition potion of sand herb potion

1690
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,440
when you spray sand

1691
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,560
as long as you have a job change

1692
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,120
it's anti-weed

1693
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,160
so you know it

1694
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,000
in such a way

1695
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,400
we can do it at last

1696
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,720
so we were a few years ago

1697
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,640
We have a way like this

1698
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,440
Let's go

1699
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,840
because in the Arab world it is a

1700
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
There is a nice support library

1701
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,360
called DNA Library

1702
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,560
let's go find

1703
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,880
At that time we were interested in saying

1704
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,360
when your seed

1705
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,680
when you chicken mutant pig

1706
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,200
As long as it has no so-called homologous offspring

1707
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,040
It only has Historzygone

1708
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,520
That is to say, if its homologous descendants

1709
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,960
when you plant

1710
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,960
There are two DNA's in it

1711
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,600
homologous offspring

1712
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,040
What does the absence of this homologous offspring mean?

1713
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,720
There will be a problem with your configuration body

1714
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,120
So you can't spawn poor people or plants

1715
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,000
or yours

1716
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
There is a problem with the entire embryonic development

1717
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,400
So we use a strategy like this

1718
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,400
We found quite a few genes

1719
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,800
it's basically

1720
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,000
This is the development of the whole embryo

1721
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
we discover

1722
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,000
Quite a few are related to embryonic development

1723
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,400
It's a normal spider

1724
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,200
you can find

1725
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,500
it will be ten weeks different

1726
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,700
But we take this gene

1727
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,800
when a gene is mutated

1728
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,600
you can find

1729
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,000
It turned out to be the so-called WATER

1730
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,800
is in the Hard stage

1731
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,200
At this time it is basically

1732
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,600
There is a problem with the whole development

1733
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,000
so we know that means

1734
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,200
say it in this way

1735
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,900
This gene is involved in

1736
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,900
throughout embryonic development

1737
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,900
a certain process

1738
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:39,400
we have been in the past

1739
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,400
We probably found quite a few

1740
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,400
You can find that it may be following

1741
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,200
Embryo magnet development

1742
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,600
One related to cell division

1743
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,000
In addition or some of the cells

1744
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,100
or nuclear RNA metabolism

1745
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,000
e.g. RNA

1746
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,400
Methanageal RNA to be produced

1747
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,600
to go through so called some nuclei

1748
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,960
Add a Polyase to the whole process

1749
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,520
the process it participates in

1750
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,240
What about the third one?

1751
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,720
is to affect the so-called

1752
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:06,800
Endome Memet trafficking

1753
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,280
For example, the cytoskeleton we just talked about

1754
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,560
those proteins like this

1755
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,520
So we use the time in the past

1756
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,880
we are probably

1757
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,400
There is quite a bit of research

1758
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,200
say we are here

1759
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,760
We can find that it is possible to

1760
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,560
on the ribose base

1761
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:26,640
The brevity of that RNA or

1762
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,600
nuclear human development

1763
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,600
or a

1764
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,600
with these

1765
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,920
Or Endome Memet trafficking

1766
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,480
When your gene discovers

1767
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,320
when mutation

1768
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,920
You can find the whole different package

1769
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,680
changes in growth

1770
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,280
So probably this is our past

1771
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:41,920
we were

1772
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,960
We're mostly following the development of pollen

1773
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,960
then fertilized

1774
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,760
And finally we now also follow

1775
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,080
planting development

1776
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,240
this is us in the past

1777
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,600
During this time we mainly do

1778
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,160
Finally, I want to tell you that

1779
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,360
In basic research we often ask

1780
01:03:58,360 --> 01:03:59,680
what's the use of you doing that

1781
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
In fact, the Basic Research Institute

1782
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I feel like we are here today

1783
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
professional research institute

1784
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
should say

1785
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I should thank professional institute

1786
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
give me a place to fulfill my dreams

1787
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
i probably from college

1788
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
until the Ph.D.

1789
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I'm probably doing this basic research

1790
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
But I think it's really a

1791
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
very interesting one

1792
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
a subject

1793
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
then the second we are here

1794
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I think I have another mission

1795
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
in this education

1796
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
we are in the middle of this process

1797
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
We have trained a considerable number of doctoral students

1798
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
postdoctoral fellow

1799
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Or say we have bred

1800
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
PhD students

1801
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
later returned to their country

1802
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Costa Rica

1803
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
He is now an assistant professor

1804
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
We have a postdoctoral fellow at Pingtung University of Science and Technology

1805
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
We have a postdoc in the US

1806
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
find a politics professor

1807
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
These are a mission we are here

1808
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
so i think it is

1809
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
What is the role of industry

1810
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I want to eat is a good one

1811
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Five Fingers Watermelon

1812
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
five fingers watermelon we use

1813
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
For example we can generate

1814
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
pistil

1815
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
double generation

1816
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
triploid pistil

1817
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Then the male is diploid

1818
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
We ended up using pollen tubes

1819
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
when fertilized

1820
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
cause the fruit to expand

1821
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
But the fruit

1822
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Seeds cannot be produced

1823
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
so what's the end result

1824
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
double silver

1825
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Consumers do not need to repaint after eating

1826
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
don't paint that paper

1827
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
right

1828
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
but you use

1829
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
To buy this seed from a seed company

1830
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
because it has no seeds

1831
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
You can't respond to the next generation

1832
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
so i want to say

1833
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
While you're in the middle of this process

1834
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
you understand

1835
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
you have a chance like this

1836
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
like i just said

1837
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
You can produce these with flowers within flowers

1838
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I think that's what we know

1839
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
a cumulative

1840
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
One result we can have

1841
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Finally I think I'd like to thank you

1842
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
is ours

1843
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
over the past few years

1844
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
This is the first few years

1845
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
then it's the two of us

1846
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
mathematics student

1847
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,840
These two high school students seem to win prizes at every science fair they attend

1848
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:08,200
Probably going well is to be able to represent Taiwan to participate in the international science and technology exhibition

1849
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,500
And then here's our executive team

1850
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,540
Today I want to thank this Tingyu

1851
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:14,840
The three organizations he does today

1852
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,660
He was the one who did the tissue training in the Shihu Lake

1853
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:20,220
And then here's our administrative team across the command post

1854
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,760
Our Research Assistants

1855
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,300
I don't think there are some

1856
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:26,880
So we need supplies for the logistics force

1857
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,440
Only then can we do some research ahead

1858
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,000
And finally thanks to the Ministry of Science and Technology

1859
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,120
And our Academia Sinica

1860
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:36,480
Cheviso and this agricultural development center

1861
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,680
All of this is a financial subsidy for us

1862
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,760
i think i'll stop here for today

1863
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,800
Fortunately, everyone didn't sleep too much.

1864
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,880
Then I welcome you if you have any questions

1865
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:48,640
Thanks

1866
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:56,080
Well, we thank Dr. Zhao for a very good presentation

1867
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:59,400
so we now open the question

1868
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,720
Work hard everyone, the public album will mention it to him on April 1

1869
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,040
say yes we have a little gift for the speakers

1870
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:09,120
On the side of the question asked, Mr. Zhao still has

1871
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,120
still have

1872
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,120
Responsibilities of our position

1873
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,120
There is an introduction to us above and our

1874
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:17,120
Information from our Facebook page

1875
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,120
Welcome everyone, ginseng can come

1876
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,120
good

1877
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:32,120
Excuse me, there are bear flowers and snake flowers

1878
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:36,120
So how did the source of what is called a false flower come from?

1879
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,120
What

1880
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,120
false flower

1881
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,120
Generally speaking, we

1882
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,120
we have bisexual flowers

1883
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:46,120
That is to say, this kind of flower has tooth stamen and bear stamen

1884
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,120
this is normal

1885
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,120
There's a so-called bear stamen

1886
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:53,120
holding bear example like corn

1887
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,120
its pistil is on top

1888
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,120
Its stamens are at the bottom

1889
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:00,120
So this is two generations called unisexual flowers

1890
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,240
I'm not very clear about false flowers

1891
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,340
So this is according to

1892
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,740
this is the same flower

1893
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:09,140
it has a sex

1894
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:10,540
we call bisexual flowers

1895
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:11,840
If you want unisexual flowers

1896
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,940
That is, Chi Wei and Xiong Wei are separated

1897
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:18,640
yes

1898
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:21,240
teacher sorry

1899
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,540
Just now you mentioned that

1900
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:24,640
you used to take that pollen tube

1901
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,040
Yes, the pollen tube grows by itself

1902
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,340
it you cut it off

1903
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:28,600
because we need sperm

1904
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,640
a humid space

1905
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,200
in a humid environment

1906
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,840
Yeah so I'll tell you which one are you talking about

1907
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,600
Because what I just said

1908
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,600
because when you said cut off

1909
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,600
I'm sending it will it dry?

1910
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,760
very good right

1911
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,160
I didn't speak very carefully just now

1912
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,840
that means we are the first

1913
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:45,000
We're going to make pollen, lean powder about 24

1914
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,360
about 12 hours to 24 hours

1915
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,900
maybe i know where it grows

1916
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:51,400
At this time, after you cut off

1917
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,700
you need to seal it up

1918
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:56,700
Or paint with decorative bells to prevent moisture from evaporating

1919
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,060
this is what needs to be done

1920
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,300
but you just

1921
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,700
you don't care how much you cut

1922
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,500
as long as you can maintain

1923
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,000
because it is in the whole pollen hall

1924
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,300
grow in style

1925
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,900
it keeps forming

1926
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,800
I was talking about Keris Pluck

1927
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,300
it can be a totally pollen house

1928
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,800
The most active place at the front

1929
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,200
seal it up completely

1930
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,000
you just keep that place

1931
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,700
Don't destroy the whole pollen hall

1932
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:24,600
It can deliver two gold cells to embryonic pigs

1933
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,100
complete double fertilization

1934
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:26,900
so amazing

1935
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,700
So it means it will

1936
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,600
it pollen house will know

1937
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,400
will feel the pool class

1938
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,600
Embryo sac

1939
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,200
send a message like this

1940
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,600
to attract it to grow

1941
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,000
At once

1942
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,900
we just talked about emptiness

1943
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,600
like iron lily

1944
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,400
it belongs to the style of the stroke

1945
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,400
It's actually filled with liquid

1946
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,300
we call it from

1947
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,200
Its front capital is divided into

1948
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,900
Our name is Standard Exte

1949
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,700
it keeps going from the bottom

1950
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:17,900
secrete something like this

1951
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,600
still have this

1952
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,200
yes still

1953
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,000
But pollen tubes are actually fun

1954
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,800
That means it's just been pollinated on the stigma

1955
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,600
grow and grow into the style

1956
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,400
for a while

1957
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,100
it needs its own nourishment

1958
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:35,400
So it's a pollen tube, you go straight to the inside

1959
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,400
it has a lot of oil bodies

1960
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,800
There is still a lot of Starch

1961
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,800
starch liquid

1962
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,400
But wait until it grows in the style for a while

1963
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,200
it will be from

1964
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,400
Sirac is here to absorb nutrients

1965
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,800
yes

1966
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,600
in the video just now

1967
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,800
It says that the DNA is not there are four of that

1968
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,400
to combine?

1969
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,000
Then it itself will delete what it says it doesn't want

1970
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,900
So have you learned from this

1971
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,140
how does the plant itself go about removing

1972
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:08,060
because we now have

1973
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,060
Is there any progress on this?

1974
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,860
Is there any technology in this area?

1975
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:16,700
Our current results are as far as I know

1976
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,980
Yes know we have a program called

1977
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:22,140
A mechanism of splicing to do these donations

1978
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:24,140
if you are interested

1979
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:26,540
We recently had a teacher named Tu Shilong in our Institute of Botany

1980
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:30,140
He posted an article on Plain cell last month

1981
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:33,940
Just to tell you what this mechanism will affect

1982
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:36,540
it may take to plants affected by light

1983
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:37,740
will affect flowering

1984
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:40,140
This is an article from our recent teacher

1985
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,740
It is to do this so-called splicing mechanism

1986
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:45,540
If you have a chance, you can go and find out

1987
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:46,540
Thanks

1988
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:54,540
The two techniques I've heard are

1989
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,540
One is strong and the other is

1990
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:58,540
That female dragon feels like you have a body

1991
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:00,540
into plant cells

1992
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,440
Is there any other way to create a picture group

1993
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,640
For example, the recent hot gene editing and the like

1994
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,760
Gene editing is right

1995
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,280
yes

1996
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,520
This is a good mechanism

1997
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,920
It's a system that uses CRISPR

1998
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,120
The so-called TDNA

1999
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,800
What is the benefit of this system of insertion or CRISPR

2000
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,360
you know where you insert

2001
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,160
Also we have a mutant technology called EMS

2002
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:32,320
You can treat something like this with the seeds from which it was planted

2003
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:37,360
You can see that it might be breaking a certain clip of DNA

2004
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,800
You can cause Point Mutation

2005
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,480
When you Point Mutation is you three

2006
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,280
You alone decide on an amino acid

2007
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:49,000
You may be at the end after you put this Point Mutation mutation

2008
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,560
it should keep doing it

2009
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,760
it stops here

2010
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:55,240
so you gene it has no way to complete one to produce a complete

2011
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,640
but this thing you

2012
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,200
We call it Mapping

2013
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:59,800
you don't know which gene

2014
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
backcross

2015
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
But this can also be done

2016
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
can also do

2017
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
But that is to say, it is slower

2018
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
is this another one

2019
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
What you just said is also a way

2020
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
now there are quite a few

2021
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
A gene gun is basically just a

2022
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
We are called Train Sink

2023
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
not a stable offspring

2024
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
it's just for a short time you're in a certain

2025
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
For example, today

2026
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
In addition, what we just said is called

2027
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
we can work

2028
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
called protoplasts

2029
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
you can go with some genes

2030
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
fleeting performance

2031
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
but this one has two

2032
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Your brief performance is actually

2033
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
you may be too short the first time

2034
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
You didn't grow to say a few weeks

2035
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
You don't get through the whole development process

2036
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
This is a

2037
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
The second process of your Train Sink

2038
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
You would put, for example, in a normal cell

2039
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
maybe only 100 proteins

2040
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
You Train Sink go down

2041
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
give it 10,000 protein

2042
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
it is more than itself

2043
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
so you see something

2044
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
sometimes you don't know

2045
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,240
It turned out to be a rather troublesome one.

2046
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,660
So we sometimes experiment

2047
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,520
We would prefer the so-called

2048
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,520
stable line

2049
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,800
after turning around

2050
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,860
We're not even going to use a

2051
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,440
Driving values ​​for a large number of representations

2052
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,960
Let this gene be expressed in large quantities

2053
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,440
We're going to use its own drive value instead

2054
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,640
what is its own driving value

2055
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,440
it at a certain time

2056
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:21,040
The amount of performance will be very precisely controlled

2057
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,320
let's take a look

2058
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,120
For example, the protein value

2059
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,520
silver light protein

2060
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,400
Let's see where it behaves

2061
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,240
will it help you on something

2062
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,680
These we can do research on

2063
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,720
so we sometimes

2064
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,040
You have to be very precise to control these things

2065
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:39,480
is there any problem

2066
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,600
I just saw that

2067
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,960
This little Liu is a set of black hole postcards

2068
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:48,760
very good

2069
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,000
Does he know about black holes?

2070
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:50,840
it's us

2071
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:53,240
With this very bright spot Zhongyuanyuan

2072
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,920
Cooperate with all over the world

2073
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,560
so we must strive

2074
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,240
still a few

2075
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,160
i want to ask questions

2076
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,640
I want to ask

2077
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:04,040
that for example

2078
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,340
The pollen house that the teacher said

2079
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:09,540
In this way, the seed can be produced

2080
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:10,740
Matching strain

2081
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,840
ask me like this

2082
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,480
For example, our guava

2083
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:18,600
Suppose its seed has 100 flowers

2084
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,300
like this

2085
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:23,840
Is it the pollen of every pollen house

2086
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,900
both from the same

2087
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:30,900
The other ones also come from the same flower

2088
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,900
it's the gold here thank you

2089
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,400
So this thing we will

2090
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,900
actually very similar

2091
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,900
For example, you say we

2092
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,740
Is it yours that can be told in another way?

2093
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:43,400
Did we generate those plants with bad heads all the same?

2094
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,640
you can ask

2095
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,400
In fact, we say that we are all the same

2096
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,400
Our brothers and sisters unless you are a twin today

2097
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,400
Otherwise, you will be different from your brothers and sisters

2098
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,900
So the same pollen house

2099
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:55,900
fertilization process

2100
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:57,900
its last so-called single back bottom

2101
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,900
With the single back, they will have the so-called dye combination

2102
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,920
when together

2103
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,320
This intermediate chromosome will call

2104
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,360
many things will happen

2105
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,160
So we sometimes do experiments

2106
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,320
will find

2107
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:10,080
You can see every pollen store

2108
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:14,480
The seed produced by fertilization is a single individual

2109
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,680
Every seed behaves differently

2110
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,160
you all look the same

2111
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,160
right? people all look the same

2112
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,320
everyone is different

2113
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,560
You are different from your brothers and sisters

2114
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,280
you go and see

2115
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:25,120
Every seed is like your brothers and sisters

2116
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,680
looks like seeds

2117
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,520
But their reactions are totally different

2118
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,200
So really throughout

2119
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,360
so what good is it

2120
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:35,360
When your plant goes through what is called a chromosome

2121
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,800
The pair calls for these

2122
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,520
bullets you spawn

2123
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,680
there will always be one

2124
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:42,240
when your environment is not suitable

2125
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:45,000
Maybe under these 1000 seeds

2126
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,760
have one or two

2127
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,280
can survive

2128
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,320
so your species

2129
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,040
Only then can we continue to react

2130
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,800
Like the Iron Lily we just talked about

2131
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,920
Iron Lily Seeds

2132
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,080
if i count

2133
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:59,600
A seed of an iron blast lily grown out of a flower

2134
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,040
500

2135
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,500
so quite a lot

2136
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:03,500
but each made

2137
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:04,500
Probably not the same

2138
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,500
So this fun place is

2139
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,500
So sometimes we make mutant beads

2140
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,500
You see, this is a mutant strain of the pollen tube

2141
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,000
you should think it's gonna die

2142
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,500
but it's weird

2143
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,500
I don't know I don't understand now

2144
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,500
life always will

2145
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,500
will find its way out

2146
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,500
it will always have in you

2147
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:24,500
Five or six seeds will be able to bear fruit

2148
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,500
So you can keep doing time

2149
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,500
so fun

2150
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,000
its not all dead

2151
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
it means you are an arab

2152
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Can produce fifty or sixty flowers

2153
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
One flower can bear fifty or sixty seeds

2154
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
but you are important

2155
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
severe mutant beads

2156
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
there are always a few seeds left

2157
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
you can keep doing

2158
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
A lot of fun

2159
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I don't know why

2160
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
this is what we actually

2161
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
we always wanted

2162
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
also want to know

2163
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Why

2164
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Thank you, excellent talk

2165
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
i want to ask

2166
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
You want to talk about an iron cannon board

2167
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Is it native to Taiwan?

2168
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Is it Nectar Lili?

2169
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
iron cannon board

2170
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I use East Lili

2171
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:07,000
we want to find out now

2172
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
We know when there is essence

2173
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
There are also medical treatments that cannot be let go

2174
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
With medical treatment and discounts

2175
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
very close to lilly

2176
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
So if your research

2177
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
You use this seed in Taiwan

2178
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
is the seed of Taiwan

2179
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
or bio-decoration seeds for sale

2180
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,000
The iron cannon box we used before

2181
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Is East Lily

2182
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
basically bought by the seed company

2183
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
But in the future we will use

2184
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
What I just said will use Taiwan

2185
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Taiwan box

2186
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
among us

2187
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Another No. 1 Taiwan pendulum box

2188
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
These are the ones I use now

2189
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Commercial of these East Lily

2190
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
It is self incompatible

2191
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
That is to say, my own flowers are not able to

2192
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
receive flowers produce flowers

2193
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
But Taiwan's display box is very special

2194
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
it can

2195
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
So it gives us another big

2196
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
yes i want to ask him

2197
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
common environment is

2198
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
environmental

2199
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
is different

2200
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
OK Taiwan Lily is basically found in the mountains

2201
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
But we can grow in the greenhouse

2202
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
We also did Xiao Xiang here

2203
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
We could have done it last time too

2204
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
We self-pollinate to produce

2205
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
received quite a lot of fruit

2206
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
probably too

2207
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
it can receive hundreds no problem

2208
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
so we have been doing

2209
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
So it's like a worm cage

2210
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
or that ginger

2211
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Its flowering is the same as Lily's

2212
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
this chicken is the same

2213
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
sorry i really don't know that

2214
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
OK

2215
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Thanks

2216
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Seems like this black hole is funny

2217
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I was asked just now

2218
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
actually quite interesting

2219
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I would love to ask about flowering plants

2220
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
some are blossoming in the industry

2221
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
is it possible to change

2222
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,600
make it bloom by day

2223
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,800
Of course I think this is for example

2224
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,200
You can be like our director

2225
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,700
What he does is related to light

2226
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,400
Light can regulate flowering

2227
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,300
you can make these changes

2228
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:18,100
But I miss Ye Lai Xiang

2229
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,900
If you let it open during the day, I don’t know if it smells good or not

2230
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,200
So I feel this thing

2231
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,600
We knew you could change into one of its shapes

2232
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,000
but you may lose other

2233
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,500
So I think it's a lot

2234
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,100
We may need improvement as a whole

2235
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:34,700
is there any good for us doing this

2236
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,500
so i think sometimes

2237
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:39,000
But actually I think we sometimes

2238
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,400
when we're all doing

2239
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:47,000
We are the caretakers who discover its creation

2240
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,800
we are not inventing we are discovering

2241
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,700
But its discovery must have its uses

2242
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:56,700
So I can say that it should be possible to make this adjustment

2243
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,800
Even we say they have done a lot

2244
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
How to tune with light for flowering

2245
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
But this we basically understand its mechanism

2246
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
But I don't think it does

2247
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I don't know if there is such an attempt in the future to make

2248
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Arab worlds bloom at night

2249
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
but i don't know what's the use

2250
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
if there is no problem

2251
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Our black hole is about as fun as it gets.

2252
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
So here's another

2253
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
yes

2254
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
study process

2255
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I think

2256
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
not i think

2257
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:49,000
In fact, I have always liked biological things.

2258
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
this

2259
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,000
And then the one that really let me pluck it in

2260
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I was very impressed that I was a freshman

2261
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
i don't know what to do now

2262
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I'm talking about my freshman year

2263
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
university metropolis

2264
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
We used to have bank dances when we first entered college.

2265
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
right

2266
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
You'll probably all go to the bank dance

2267
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
We were also unavoidable that time

2268
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Let's go to the bank dance

2269
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
you know us

2270
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Country kids are always shy

2271
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I guess it's not fun

2272
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
He and I are above the theater

2273
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
above our own theater

2274
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
There is a bright classroom

2275
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
It turned out that a senior was doing an experiment

2276
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
I'll go in and talk to him

2277
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Senior, I'm just going to strike up a conversation anyway.

2278
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
What are you doing

2279
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
After we're done talking, the dance is over.

2280
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
But from that day I knew

2281
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
i want to do research

2282
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
so i really didn't lie to you

2283
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I study hard in college

2284
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
everyone can

2285
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
we play too, right?

2286
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
but also play

2287
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
but we study hard

2288
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Of course, you may be all about books

2289
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Why

2290
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Because my senior told me

2291
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
We are also very obedient

2292
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
The senior said you want to apply to go abroad

2293
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
your grades are better

2294
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
so how about good grades

2295
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
study

2296
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
so you play and play

2297
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
but you know what you want

2298
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
so i finished college

2299
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Then go to graduate school

2300
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
then became a soldier

2301
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
After serving as a soldier

2302
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
because i know i'm in

2303
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I used to do it myself

2304
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Comparing the traditional research on occupational science

2305
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Don't know anything about molecular biology

2306
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
i know that's a trend

2307
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
So after I finish my military service

2308
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
i served as a soldier at the youth headquarters

2309
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
it's very close

2310
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
So after my young headquarters served as a soldier

2311
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Come to Zhongying Yuan as a doppelganger

2312
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
research assistant

2313
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
our same issue

2314
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Later, they are our current colleagues

2315
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
many

2316
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
So after two years as an assistant

2317
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
study abroad

2318
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
study abroad

2319
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
So I've been all the way

2320
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
thanks for the grades

2321
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
everything went well

2322
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I'm all over this

2323
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
environment of this study

2324
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
research environment

2325
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
because i just want

2326
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
So I was in America

2327
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
when you come back

2328
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I also only apply for the position of the China Campus Institute

2329
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,740
I didn't upgrade any other

2330
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:03,240
also really thank god

2331
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,160
just came back

2332
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:07,680
Then it is really a very

2333
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:10,480
In the future, I hope that all young students will have the opportunity

2334
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,240
You can come to our job site to have a look

2335
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,440
These teachers are really great.

2336
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,320
They are many, many times stronger than me

2337
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,480
especially those new

2338
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:18,680
you can get from everyone

2339
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:19,800
like us

2340
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,120
I just said after we got back here

2341
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:23,200
we have all been

2342
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,360
I think education is very important

2343
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:28,520
So I'm probably all except us math students

2344
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:29,920
we will take students number of students

2345
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:32,360
Our program is very good

2346
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:33,760
Look at these two summer students

2347
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,160
the year before last year

2348
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,080
they last

2349
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,680
We won our last games

2350
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:40,720
The two high school students I just talked about

2351
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,520
They got awards

2352
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,760
They are also participating in the National Science Fair

2353
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,040
get this too

2354
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,280
so we have a lot of opportunities like this

2355
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:50,000
able to attract students

2356
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,640
I think this is probably us

2357
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,280
high school

2358
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,160
high school i

2359
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,840
I also participate in the biological society

2360
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,960
The senior generation participates in clubs and other high schools

2361
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,240
In the second-generation high school clubs, only the third-year students are studying

2362
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:04,440
So I didn't do very well

2363
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:07,220
same is

2364
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,120
thanks for sharing

2365
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,200
you just spoke

2366
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,840
thank god twice

2367
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,200
yes

2368
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,720
so you're probably a christian

2369
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,840
yes

2370
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:23,760
i think that

2371
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,440
sorry i'm a christian too

2372
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:27,560
we in christian education we speak

2373
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,080
Evolution and Creation

2374
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:31,920
in your experience

2375
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,720
Who do you think is more likely to summon

2376
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,320
In fact, I think evolution

2377
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,480
your speech

2378
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:39,440
actually stand by me

2379
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,720
I think the theory of evolution is

2380
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,400
I mean something about you

2381
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:44,600
He can

2382
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:45,880
probably means

2383
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,280
giraffe neck

2384
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:47,640
right

2385
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:48,760
longer

2386
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,480
as long as in that environment

2387
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:51,400
it's getting less and less

2388
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:52,280
it's getting higher

2389
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,240
But you said the giraffe was going to turn into a rhino

2390
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:54,960
but a bit difficult

2391
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,240
But the giraffe neck

2392
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,320
just run out

2393
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,160
this means

2394
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,420
Come to agree. From this point of view, I agree.

2395
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,800
creation theory

2396
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:10,120
If there is a word, it is impossible for you to be more difficult

2397
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:10,680
I have no idea

2398
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:11,040
I think

2399
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,040
We are so complicated now alone

2400
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:17,040
You said you want to start with the original one

2401
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:17,880
maybe tens of thousands of years

2402
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,520
I think it's a little difficult

2403
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:20,640
I find it difficult

2404
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,040
I think it's almost time

2405
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,000
Our other postcards must be given to Mr. Zhao

2406
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,320
good

2407
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,320
I'm just curious, that's what

2408
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:29,320
in that

2409
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,440
Infertility

2410
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,040
Can

2411
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,920
infertile hybrid

2412
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,240
And that self-pollinating hand

2413
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,920
In the process of pollen hall formation

2414
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,120
What would be the difference in those lead substances

2415
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:38,720
OK

2416
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,160
Self-incompatibility of Baozi body

2417
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,240
is the so-called

2418
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:44,640
Because the so-called incompatible thing

2419
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,920
on the surface of pollen grains

2420
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,800
The surface of the pollen grain is from

2421
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:49,320
So-called

2422
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:51,840
flowers are coming

2423
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,120
So the one where the flower will come is a diploid

2424
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:55,320
So it's bun body

2425
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,040
The gametophyte is indistinct

2426
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:00,000
When the pollen house the gamete grows in the pistil

2427
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Inside, this is the configuration body

2428
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
what about this time

2429
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,500
From its suffix, it will be clear that it is called SRNS

2430
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:09,500
This goes into the pollen tube of the plant

2431
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:12,500
This SRNS will put the Mission-9NS inside

2432
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,500
so7RNA

2433
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:15,000
All of these RNAs are kneeled down

2434
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
So it has no way to cause

2435
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Another one is the so-called

2436
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,500
Jia Riko

2437
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,500
Not Kelson

2438
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:24,000
some have one another

2439
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,500
in the so-called self-infertility

2440
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,000
Also the pollen tubes are on the inside

2441
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
but it caused

2442
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
No, this is Jia Lizi

2443
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
That lid makes it impossible to get in

2444
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
so the whole later

2445
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
The entire pollen tube cannot grow

2446
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
So the mechanism is slightly different

2447
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
OK, I'll just NAS

2448
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
The next trial

2449
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
December 17th

2450
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Hu Shi

2451
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
We have a lecture by Dean Gu

2452
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
It is a popular science lecture given by President Gu of Hu Shi

2453
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
that's from the Institute of History and

2454
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Lecture by Wang Hongtai Research Institute

2455
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
From Ximenqing to Jiabaoying

2456
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Feminist Review and Emotional Evolution with the People of the Ming and Qing Dynasties

2457
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,600
very different subject

2458
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,800
These grids are for everyone to participate in

2459
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,000
next science talk

2460
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,400
Well, we thank Dr. Gao Guangyu, Gao Guang Researcher

2461
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,000
"Female Reviews and Emotional Actors in the Ming and Qing Dynasties"
