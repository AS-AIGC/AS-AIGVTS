72
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,960
That

73
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,780

I also often lead delegations to various parts of the world for cultural exchanges

80
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,240
then we today

81
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,600
when I just ate

82
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,380
why don't you talk about opera

83
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,040
He said opera is too difficult

84
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,640
So he picks one to compare with what everyone can

85
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,200
Appreciating and accepting is the musical beauty of poetry

86
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,000
then let us

87
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,240
with joy

88
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,240
this lead

89
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,280

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,080

Thank you to all the friends present

96
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,280
very

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
grateful

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The topic I try to talk about is

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
musical beauty of poetry

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
what i call poetry

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It is the literary literature of all dynasties in China

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So it covers a wide range of

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
even folk songs

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
minor

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and poetry

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Ode to Tang Poetry Yuanqu

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
even collecting literature

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And this extreme of literature

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It can be said that it is drama

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
what i call musical beauty

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
you could say so

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
verbal and vocal

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
May I

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The Compatibility of Words and Voices

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Can you hear me from behind?

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The combination of words and voices

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Again

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,600
I talked about the fusion of song and music

119
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,800
So I chose this topic with two hopes

120
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:19,600
The first is I think our current appreciation of traditional rhyme literature

121
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:28,800
Critical studies often refer to the phrases of its literature

122
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,400
to analyze its meaning, situation, thought, emotion

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And ignore the fact that rhyme literature still has a very important component

124
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,600
that is rhyme

125
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,600
The rhyme here is the melody of the language

126
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,600
that is music

127
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,600
There must be a match between them

128
00:06:52,600 --> 00:07:00,000
Because the voice is to set off the emotion

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:12,000
There are many functions to strengthen and describe, which can increase the aesthetic feeling of the magnet.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:23,000
At the same time, the magnetic drum will also have a stimulating effect on the raw drum, stimulating the potential language melody.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The harmony between the two is the real perfect rhyme literature.

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It would be incomplete to say that you appreciate, criticize, study, or ignore one aspect of it.

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
This is number one.

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Second, I used to have a few good friends with me, they were all great musicians, including Xu Changhui and Ma Shuilong, both of them knew each other well.

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There is also Professor You Changfa, who has cooperated.

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Zheng Chenggong composed by me in modern Chinese songs

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
There are Bawang Fish Chicken and even Taohuashan

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But I found that the Western music business they said had a very large impact

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Therefore, we have not mastered our Chinese language very well.

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So none of the modern Chinese operas I'm going to sing is a complete success

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That is to say, if the current lyricists, composers, and even singers

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If you can understand the process of our Chinese language melody

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Lyrics that should be created

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
There will be no conflicts with love

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Compare us when we were young

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Just when the mainland retreated

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
They all sang a song called "Defend Greater Taiwan"

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
However, due to the poor mastery of the language skills of the general practitioners

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Sing out and become surrounded by Taiwan

150
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This is what we use now

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This "Tachishima Little Music Circle"

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Eyes of the Lord Tree

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But they are all sung as the long eyes of the Lord tree

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And "Night Manciolo"

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
it's official

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
"Moonlight Time"

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Look at the seven characters

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
there are five words

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
is to remove new words

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,700
And to be born is to sin

161
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:08,300
How could he present this beautiful language melody

162
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,800
How can it not change?

163
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,300
like these

164
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,800
everything I hope to achieve

165
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,700
what about today

166
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,100
Of course some of the talk is about heart

167
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,300
But there are also some theories

168
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,100
so for everyone

169
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,300
don't doze off

170
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,300
I also specially take

171
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,700
a music professor

172
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,800
That's Professor Deyi

173
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
ok please stand up

174
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
good

175
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,600
What about him

176
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,300
Is a Ph.D. from the Hong Kong New Asia Institute

177
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:50,300
Also served as the director of the Chinese Music Department of National Taiwan University of Arts

178
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,600
and the Dean of the Academy of Performing Arts

179
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,300
Now at Chenggong University

180
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,000
Serve as a professor at the Institute of Arts

181
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
because he likes to compose old poems

182
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
he sang very well again

183
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
At least I think it's very good

184
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
so with his beautiful singing voice

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and his understanding of language

186
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
How to convert old poems into songs

187
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
speak out

188
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
make you compare

189
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
today i will explain first

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
i hope roughly what i said

191
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
About an hour and 20 minutes

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Professor Shi Deyi demonstrates for 10 minutes to 15 minutes

193
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Leave it for 20-30 minutes

194
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Come to exchange questions

195
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I put what I know about you

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I try to solve it

197
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
ok now i start

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
let me sit down

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Everyone look at my white hair

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
There are also some consecutive

201
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,500
What I'm going to talk about today has about three parts

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The first part is

203
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,000
Compassionate and Compassionate

204
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,000
then his most important one

205
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,700
basic cognition

206
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,200
what is language melody

207
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,800
What factors does language melody include

208
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
what do they do

209
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
this is the first

210
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,500
From here on we extend

211
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,000
Every place has a local dialect

212
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,000
The so-called gun tone

213
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,500
So what about the gun tone?

214
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,000
also very complicated

215
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,900
All rap, literature, art, opera

216
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,200
even songs

217
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,700
Do-han Gun tunes close relationship

218
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,200
Then between gun tune and singing gun

219
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
what does it matter

220
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Aria

221
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What's the matter with this accent and this vocal cavity?

222
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Then the real singing is completed

223
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I personally think that the singer's singing

224
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
singer's voice

225
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Let me tell you this concept

226
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't think I can talk about the third part

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Then the two systems of elegance and vulgarity in opera dramas

228
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
what this has to say

229
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
To say why there is no genre based on

230
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why does this basis have these questions of genre

231
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But today it may not be possible

232
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Maybe I'll take a big shot

233
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So first of all, let's talk about

234
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The process of emotion

235
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's a word

236
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The result of my analysis

237
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Please look at my question

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,500
fourth paragraph in the synopsis

239
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:22,500
I said that those who belong to the form of lyrics have the inner reading of the language itself,

240
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:40,500
group, autophonic structure, tone, combination, operation and writing, arrangement, syllable form, transportation, breaking down, adverb structure, sentence structure, intention, taste, appeal, etc.

241
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:51,500
It can be seen that there are a total of eight direct numbers in my analysis, and what I am going to talk about today is only the more important ones.

242
00:14:52,500 --> 00:15:00,500
First of all, the characteristics of our Chinese language are one character, one sound, and one sound.

243
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Each phoneme contains five elements, including sound and final, and the final includes the sound, rhyme, rhyme ending, and tone, so there are five phonetic elements in total.

244
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:44,000
This is because of the location of its pronunciation, the method of pronunciation, and the rhyme, the front of the tongue, the middle of the tongue, and the back of the tongue, and even its height, the height of the rhyme of Zhangguo size, these are quite complicated.

245
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:58,000
At the same time, it also has tone, that is to say, in rhyme and warm water, in fact, the basis of its influence on tone and emotion is in the sound of a character,

246
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So in this pronunciation,

247
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,200
Now you have ops and non-ops

248
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,700
Or the high or low of the cause has a great influence

249
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:17,200
That's why every word the ancients said

250
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,600
He has a closed accent

251
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,400
The voice is very low and it is difficult to make a sound

252
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,000
There is also a reason why he is louder when he is low

253
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
With the addition of operation and maintenance, he is loud and long

254
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
There are already these contained in a word sound

255
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
As far as the whole literature is concerned

256
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The reason why he differs from Semitic literature

257
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
just above that luck

258
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This luck has two meanings

259
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What we're talking about now is actually chivalry

260
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Just the embossed corner

261
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,600
The composition of a voice in this

262
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,200
In a broad sense

263
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,700
then with the melody of the language

264
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,200
Including Father Han

265
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Chu Ci, what about these loving fathers?

266
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,600
He pays attention to language and melody, which should be included in it

267
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,700
Today we are talking about chivalry

268
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,300
what about you guys

269
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:29,000
Let's take a look at the one in this handout.

270
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,200
Li Shangrong's police involvement

271
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,000
I think most of Li Shangrong's friends here will recite

272
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,200
This poem is a seven character poem

273
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
his rhyme

274
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,800
Starting from the first sentence of mobile phone imprinting

275
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,000
idle

276
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,600
Then what

277
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,200
At the beginning, two, four, six, and eight all rhyme

278
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Two four six eight is the rhyme

279
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,320
then point, smoke and face

280
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,880
in these few words

281
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,960
Both contain a sound like smoke in it

282
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,000
That is to say, the hard foot is to use

283
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,640
A pedal for the part inside the phonetic

284
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,200
what does the pedal produce

285
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,680
The role of echo

286
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,000
a sense of melody

287
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,080
And it put the slow sound

288
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,840
pump it up

289
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,880
So when the hard strings of the first word come out

290
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,000
it's against the hard feet below

291
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,440
That stickiness has the function of exhalation

292
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,880
Glue it out for the front of that string

293
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,600
Response to Response

294
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,920
So this creates a response

295
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,200
A sense of melody

296
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,600
This teacher in China likes to suppress luck according to the grid

297
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,960
Because the grid according to the compression is 1357 can not be compressed

298
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,280
The first sentence of Qiyuan is that it can be suppressed or not

299
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,640
1357 not oppressed 268 months

300
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,400
what effect does this have

301
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,800
also oppressive sentence

302
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,440
where is his voice

303
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,440
because I recalled using

304
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,080
produce a narrative effect

305
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,400
And what about the unlucky one?

306
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,680
have a diffuse effect

307
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,360
Therefore

308
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,080
between unlucky and unlucky

309
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,960
one loose one loose

310
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,200
Loose and loose

311
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,800
This alternate operation

312
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,680
so what

313
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,880
Luck

314
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,720
probably sober

315
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,400
this kind

316
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,560
probably for example

317
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,680
every word

318
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,120
if like a pearl

319
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,720
then pearls are loose

320
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
light is cold

321
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
but what if

322
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
use it

323
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
this

324
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
string it together

325
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
become a string of words

326
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
then it's light

327
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
just shine in the opposite direction

328
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
hanging on a woman's chest

329
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
it's so beautiful

330
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The role of that rhyme angle

331
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
like the string of pearls

332
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
take every word

333
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
slow sound

334
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
put it in a thread

335
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So

336
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
part of rhyme

337
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's like the knots in our bamboo

338
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Everyone knows

339
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
what about the bamboo itself

340
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
it is a parallel fiber tree

341
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
it

342
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Parallel is of course not united

343
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
so the wind blows

344
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
it just fell apart

345
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
But because there is a knot

346
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Bamboo it up

347
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So this bamboo can be far away from

348
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
it

349
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,320
In the east wind, the posture is very beautiful

350
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,520
Then that hard foot is like a knot of bamboo

351
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,280
Therefore, if we extend it

352
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,280
If this hard foot is said to be loose

353
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:24,280
So loose is what it was before it appeared hard feet

354
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,480
How many words are just a few hard feet

355
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,520
longer words

356
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,680
Then the voice will appear slow

357
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,040
like Seven Words

358
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,480
It's ten hard feet to have one hard

359
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,760
So this hard length is fourteen stiff feet

360
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,680
In the words of the five-word teacher, ten hard feet

361
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,160
It is said that the seven-speaking teacher who is oppressed is the seven hard-footed

362
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,760
This is the so-called concept of the ancients.

363
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,360
so long

364
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,680
If the words are medium, if the words are long, the life will be slow

365
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:12,480
If the transportation is secret, for example, three characters, one courtyard, four characters, one courtyard

366
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,060
This is denser, so it appears more compact

367
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:22,080
This will produce the effect of emotion. There is such a phenomenon in pressure luck.

368
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,400
It oppresses itself, as I just said, it also has a personality.

369
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:34,400
If this personality is used well, it can also create love, let go of love, and get a picture of each other

370
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,780
For example, I made up the air, Hualien sang it, I will never use that

371
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:48,180
Mood, this closed accent like this

372
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:53,400
You imagine that Hualien is an export flash

373
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,800
If it shuts its mouth and makes its voice come out nasally

374
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
how can this fit its

375
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
What about the taste?

376
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
but what if

377
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
when you are like a tree

378
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
sometimes use this

379
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Better

380
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
you want this like

381
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What about Li Bai?

382
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Chaotic troops pick cloud dry

383
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
A Thousand Miles of Rivers Return One Day

384
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yuansheng on both sides of the strait

385
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Can't hold it

386
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Please do to buy Wanzhongshan

387
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
What do you think of Li Bai's teacher?

388
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Down from the Yangtze River

389
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
down the river

390
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
written in shortcut

391
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
that mood

392
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
he pressed

393
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
install

394
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
you see his mouth is open

395
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Then

396
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Forcing the time to force the sound out

397
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
what makes this

398
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Ann this sound

399
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
short

400
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
if you press

401
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Lianjiang in Korean

402
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
night into the lake

403
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Ping Ning off

404
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
brute

405
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,500
So the chorus of broken-hearted friends pollutes it

406
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,000
come on something

407
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,500
Therefore, the ancients had to pay attention to the selection of seals.

408
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,000
Pay attention to the selection of seals is the story of this person

409
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,500
This is about the corner

410
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Then why did Li Bai's teacher read it up?

411
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,500
so well deserved

412
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Especially this song of his is written in ancient Yuefu poems

413
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,500
He just has a few tricks

414
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:44,500
First, he is in this field

415
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
He changes a lot

416
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
Multiple levels of length change

417
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
this is the first

418
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Second, he transferred

419
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,500
change that luck

420
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
A few sentences are different

421
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
turn luck

422
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,200
because he looks fast

423
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,400
because he has changed

424
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,400
The other is that he likes to use mythological and historical anecdotes

425
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
an effect of

426
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
In terms of voice

427
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,400
He is the match of long and short

428
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Here I lift Jiang Jingjiu

429
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Everyone knows this song

430
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,200
I just read the first few sentences

431
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,800
save time

432
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,800
The army does not see the water of the Yellow River coming up from the sky

433
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,800
rush to the sea

434
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,800
The army does not see the mirror

435
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,800
North and North France were included in the Mucheng Club of the Qing Dynasty

436
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
a turn of luck

437
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,800
A total of five or six times of luck were transferred below.

438
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:58,800
The three words "Junbubu" have considerable effect

439
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Thanks

440
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,140
After adding three words, the length of its language will be lengthened

441
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:11,780
The sentence below is due to its raising tone and leading tone

442
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,100
Two sentences are just like I can't remember

443
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,660
So if you read

444
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,280
Don't you see the water of the Yellow River coming up from the sky

445
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,600
rush to the sea

446
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,420
Everyone, the smell is a little weaker.

447
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:37,080
Like what I just read, don’t you see the water of the Yellow River coming up from the sky and rushing to the sea, never to be embraced again

448
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,920
The chicken stall is different

449
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,960
This is language selection

450
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,840
Let me give you an example to explain that this is relatively short.

451
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,200
That is the Yimeiren explained on the fifth page of my lecture notes

452
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,520
three stages of life

453
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,020
teenagers, adults, old age

454
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,180
describe the same thing

455
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,020
use listening language

456
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,060
The place where teenagers listen to language and the place where adults listen to language

457
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,280
Old people listen differently

458
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,120
the three stages of life

459
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,020
It's all changing and the situation is different

460
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,240
It takes advantage of the resignation of beauty

461
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,920
The feature of quitting is gathering together and oppressing luck

462
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,720
so the pace will be fast

463
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,920
But it has two doses and one shipment

464
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,220
So things change a lot

465
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,420
And turning a fortune is the realm of a life

466
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,220
So like this can also be said to be in love

467
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,020
A place where we can meet each other

468
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,820
I'll practice it again

469
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,200
The young man listens to the language and sings, the red candle sings in the dark,

470
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:13,700
Among the young people who listened to the guest, he talked about the clouds and asserted that he taught Xifeng,

471
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:19,300
Now listening to the language students have no sense of sickness first suppress,

472
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:27,200
It's more ruthless than the ring clutch, one person catches the punch, and it's a bit of a way to avoid it.

473
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,400
Ladies and gentlemen, the strange sound I read is relatively short.

474
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Then Jiang Huoying made a pause, saying no, really stop it.

475
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Like this, it can be said that the application of the rhyme is also appealing, truthful, and compatible.

476
00:28:49,400 --> 00:29:00,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the use of rhymes can be said to have existed since the beginning of rhyme singing.

477
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,000
The roots of an art we all share

478
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
literature and art

479
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Stepping on the ground is a folk dance

480
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
shake is sing

481
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Singing and shaking to dance the folk dance

482
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
This root elicits

483
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That footprint can be said to be the place where the rhythm is stepped

484
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So oppression is almost a natural phenomenon.

485
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But the following will affect us in China

486
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
What about the Indian language melody?

487
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The second most important tone

488
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It is indeed quite complete

489
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
That's the Southern Dynasties

490
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
During the famous years of Qi Liang, the provincial level

491
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Because of this relationship between translating Buddhist scriptures and translating Buddhist scriptures

492
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
From the language of India to our Chinese language

493
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It turns out that we also have four kinds of raw tunes in China

494
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
That's what I want to enter

495
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Only then did I really discover

496
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So what does it mean to enter the life tune?

497
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm not an originalist

498
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
but my personal feeling

499
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It's actually the way Inpo works

500
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Everyone knows we make a sound

501
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Object vibrating produces sound

502
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Then the longer the vibration, the longer the sound

503
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
The magnitude of the vibration is large

504
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
is the sound intensity

505
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
vibration frequency

506
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
big is pitch

507
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
frequency is pitch

508
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
If the vibration frequency is high

509
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
very high

510
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So the pitch is long and strong

511
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and the timbre of everyone's voice

512
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
is common to all human beings

513
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Then in our Chinese language

514
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
compared to the west

515
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
compared to the Japanese

516
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
we have another tone

517
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
The tone is Import and it runs

518
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Everyone knows that the operation of the sound is

519
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
More than 300 meters per second

520
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
has a way of running

521
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
For example, in a flat voice

522
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
East

523
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
is so

524
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
applause first

525
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
East

526
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
gasp

527
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
East

528
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Into the sound is to contain

529
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
PTK sound should be bit

530
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Therefore, life is a special extension of Haomiao Zunan.

531
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Longevity is the greatest voice of the composer

532
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
breath is a strong and powerful sequence

533
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Entrance is extremely short

534
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Each of the four tones has its own character

535
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The combination of these four tones produces three ranks

536
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
there is peace

537
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Ping means just saying that Dong is Ping.

538
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
It's not even up

539
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Entrance was blocked because the business came out

540
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So entering life is neither fair nor unfair

541
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You know flat is what we call flat

542
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Injustice is what the five people said

543
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So strictly speaking, life is flat

544
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
This is

545
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,320
Then why did you enroll everyone

546
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
watch it here

547
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
Because there is another kind of birth

548
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,320
This straight line of this strong flesh

549
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,820
life

550
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,820
Because Uncle Ping looks fleshy

551
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,820
up due to twists and turns

552
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,820
so strong

553
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,320
Enrollment?

554
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,320
its shortcoming

555
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,820
Muscle moon is also strong

556
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,820
so put it in the

557
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,820
in this life

558
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,820
so you see

559
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,820
It's not even after being born

560
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,820
a straight line

561
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,820
There is a long tube and a straight line

562
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,820
what's with this

563
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,820
have this strong meat

564
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,820
there is a straight line

565
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,820
Look at these three straight lines

566
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,820
put it together

567
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,820
Birth and death match together

568
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,820
think about it

569
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,820
How many different can be matched

570
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,820
sound type out

571
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,820
why patriotism

572
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,820
or now Mark Six

573
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,680
so hard to win

574
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,600
because there are six more

575
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,440
I've forgotten it all

576
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,600
because i never watch this

577
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,360
You can't do it with several permutations and combinations

578
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,920
There are these three kinds in the same raw tune

579
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,720
The so-called strong

580
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,640
and the strongest

581
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,680
There are also various levels of strength

582
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,360
the same length

583
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,160
So it can be combined with ever-changing

584
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,000
The reason why

585
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,720
Later, it was so valued and so particular in music.

586
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,800
is that it has such a straightness

587
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,520
So two flat voices

588
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,680
two applause

589
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,720
two voices

590
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
two entrances

591
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,920
Matching together can best show the characteristics of the raw tone itself

592
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,720
you see two applause

593
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,320
Our friends here, try it

594
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,080
can you read it

595
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,240
can't read

596
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,960
because it's so twisty

597
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,240
So those earthen walls haven't changed enough

598
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,300
so you read the president

599
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,600
you have to read the president

600
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,300
Then Lee Teng-hui is even more difficult to read when he is president

601
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,900
All three of them are life rewarders

602
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,640
We have to change President Lee

603
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,640
So he can only change if he changes

604
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,040
Therefore, the ancients paid attention to the birth and death

605
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,240
You only need two rewards to use together

606
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,740
it's not a good relationship

607
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,740
What's more, the three died

608
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,840
if two words together

609
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,140
go from now on

610
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,440
you show a kind of war

611
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,780
go from here

612
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,640
go away

613
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,240
from now on what

614
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,640
This go-go has its own characteristics among the two rebirths

615
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,340
But if you use three consecutive

616
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,940
like i said

617
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,140
this is right

618
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,640
Look at the four voices

619
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,200
now bol is four air voices

620
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,880
how can you make it out of a

621
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,480
Is there a sense of winding melody?

622
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,320
So it's the same as getting hurt

623
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,440
Its special display here

624
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,760
So the matching of tones becomes

625
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,960
is a very important structure of language melody

626
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,480
And the ancients in this four tones and eight generations

627
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:39,400
I have noticed that there are eight combinations in the four tones, which is not good

628
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,080
The Tang Dynasty began to slowly discover

629
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,480
peaceful uneven

630
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,320
Alternate use of different types can produce a very beautiful sense of melody

631
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,800
because of the same tone

632
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,440
The same level can produce a very beautiful harmony

633
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,080
There can be conflicts between

634
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,140
So if you are interested

635
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,940
judgment

636
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,740
if you analyze it

637
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:15,360
Then its nuclear catastrophe and conflict are equal

638
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,380
are equal

639
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,760
So it can produce a kind of balanced and wrong

640
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,860
This melody of different yang and staggered balance comes out

641
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,900
you make a ratio

642
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,180
like this

643
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:29,940
this

644
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,220
Brocade

645
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,260
for no reason

646
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,280
warrior

647
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,040
Blood

648
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:34,800
How about it

649
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,600
brocade this pussy

650
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,620
This this

651
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,440
then it's nuclear

652
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,240
for no reason

653
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,520
another nuclear diarrhea

654
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,020
but

655
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,360
There must be a conflict between yin and semen

656
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,680
The samurai of the samurai string is this again

657
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,960
it and that

658
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,820
The mediocrity above is of course conflict and the blood below

659
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,620
It's also a conflict

660
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,140
so

661
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Is this industry the first drama and the second drama

662
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:13,000
must be the most conflicting

663
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
What about the second to the third drama?

664
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It has a general ah this harmonious

665
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Therefore, the alternate operation of year to year is produced.

666
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It has such a kind of standing rule that it appears

667
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yes, it's the opposite. The year and the year are a kind of harmony

668
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
like poor government

669
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
But in the evening hall, after the hall

670
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
What should we pay attention to when we start to pay attention to the poor government?

671
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
a tone rate

672
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:00,000
The first one is that our Duhushi gave birth to him

673
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
he is very particular

674
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
dufoe himself said

675
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
He loses interest when he sees words in the evening

676
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
In his later years, he was very concerned about the language and melody of poetry.

677
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
He is very particular

678
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Most people say that what he pays attention to is

679
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Four life must suffer

680
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Because I usually have this when I live here.

681
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Usually there is a straight line

682
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
if in a sentence

683
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Let the words appear when you usually go to live

684
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
He didn't listen to the change in his voice

685
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
so like him a flower fly jane

686
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
blow spring

687
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Let's analyze it

688
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
into the sound

689
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
piece of sound

690
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Flowers fly mediocre

691
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Jane Appreciation

692
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
blowing sound

693
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
In this sentence, there are usually to live and

694
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Let's look at the jade mirror flower eyes

695
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,200
How long does it take for Moyan Mountain to deposit

696
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,300
and below

697
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,800
teasing physics fictional

698
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,700
You see, this voice is beautiful even if you can't read it.

699
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,400
It's the place of four tones

700
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,700
in a sentence

701
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,400
have four tones

702
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,600
These ordinary people notice

703
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,800
and even more amazing

704
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,400
What is he there? 1357

705
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,400
this unrhyme place

706
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
he changes

707
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,400
what if

708
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,000
This does not rhyme as

709
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
last word of a sentence

710
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,900
is the completion point of meaning

711
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,800
point of completion

712
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,800
Where does it rhyme?

713
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,200
is the meaning completion point

714
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,000
complete the rhyme

715
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,200
so what

716
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,200
he is more important

717
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,400
more important

718
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,800
But one three five seven poly ink

719
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,100
also very important

720
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,100
If it doesn't match, just say four times

721
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Of course he is not like this in every song

722
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
but he has noticed

723
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
For example, like the song Qijiang I recited just now

724
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
A piece of flower flies to reduce spring

725
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Gentlemen of Zhengtao

726
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Let's look at the jade mirror flower eyes

727
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
applause

728
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Ink feast with three more and nine alcohols

729
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Little Tang Dynasty Bandit Cui on the River

730
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
die

731
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I wish you a happy high school year

732
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Unreasonable Saigyou Enrollment

733
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
This is actually his housewife Du Chenyan

734
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
will use this trick

735
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So Du Ren pays attention to the kind of poem

736
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
The melody of the poem is lost

737
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
In fact, all masters are like this

738
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,680
Another self-interest of his is that he wants to make better use of a natural melody

739
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:18,680
I divide the melody into two types: the natural melody and the melody

740
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,540
The natural melody of Yiren was before Qi Liang

741
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:29,180
Although the Chinese writers at that time knew

742
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,980
but can't say

743
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,040
Sima Xiangru

744
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,960
He just thinks there is a very beautiful sense of melody in this house

745
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,520
He said one job and one injury

746
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,080
He said meritorious service hurt him just like this

747
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:51,960
Like this trendy point paper, his writing focuses on Qi

748
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,260
high and low clear left

749
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,360
In fact, the original melody in Wenqi

750
00:42:59,180 --> 00:42:59,940
Horse phase

751
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Lu Ji's literary wife said

752
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,340
Pure Stability Act

753
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,200
come out very easy

754
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,960
Non-stick characters

755
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,620
In fact, this is also based on the example of human selection

756
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,840
He didn't know until Liu Chen

757
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,540
Apply positive and negative contrast

758
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,080
What kind of light gravity?

759
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,040
But they didn't say anything

760
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,500
It is stipulated that Tang poetry is based on this example

761
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,260
artificial profit

762
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,900
inside the words

763
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,340
pay attention to

764
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,500
this

765
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,540
tone example

766
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,700
into the song

767
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,220
Tone examples not only pay attention to

768
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,960
And since the Southern Song Dynasty

769
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,500
The word begins to divide

770
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,700
arrive

771
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:53,500
After the original song, I pay more attention to the pitch

772
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,380
For example, everyone will be present

773
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,380
Do you have any good friends who can sing

774
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,780
Tang Xianzhu's

775
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
In the line of "Mountain Court"

776
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Bird love poems come and stop complaining

777
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Everyone read this sentence

778
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
inside

779
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
eight characters

780
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
There are six characters for life

781
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The ancients did not dare to write like this

782
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
The six voices of Pingshu who have never changed in their lives

783
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
But if we take language education as an example

784
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
we'll get to that later

785
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
problem of sound solution

786
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
and at this time

787
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I've been itchy all my life

788
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Our Tang Xianzhu is very good at using

789
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
natural language degree

790
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
brilliant writer

791
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
including singapore

792
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
This Su Dongpo was mistaken for saying

793
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
they don't lock

794
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
In fact, they use a natural language degree

795
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
There is another kind of taste

796
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
For example, we analyze that birds are for appreciation of life, and the love of birds is a step

797
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Affection is Yangping Yinping

798
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
blowing sound screen yang screen

799
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Xian Ting wishes to have Ping Ping go, Ping Ping this

800
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
So itself, the sound part of a few or eight characters

801
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
There are changes, so it can be matched

802
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Everyone, look at our dufu, that sunflower table song

803
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Kui table song, like this song, please take a look

804
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,000
He wrote about the sunflower in Baidi City in the Yangtze River Gorge

805
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
This sunflower table, when the ancient so-called sunflower table

806
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
That is the Yangtze River in Wushan Shenli

807
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It can be said

808
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
very narrow

809
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And what?

810
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
This mountainous mausoleum

811
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Such a contrast

812
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
he's going to write this

813
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Aoi the Yangtze River

814
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
over a thousand miles

815
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Eighth East Eighth Middle School and so on

816
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
mighty flow

817
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Then I have to write about the male tail of Baidicheng on the top of the hill.

818
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
He Tang Xia's dangerous medicine

819
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Let's see what kind of tone generation he uses

820
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Chongbazhidongbadongshan

821
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
everybody

822
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Seven words are more than a lifetime

823
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
But do you feel

824
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
except that branch

825
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
That voice is very loud

826
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
It's because it's low-pitched.

827
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
and rhymes

828
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
rhyme like east

829
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
mountain so rhyme

830
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,400
so it's pretty loud

831
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,400
Middle Eight East Eight East Mountain

832
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,400
Liu Qigan opens and closes the river

833
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,000
river water

834
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Go and go

835
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,400
finally broke through

836
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,400
should be screen

837
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,400
It seems to be forked

838
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,400
Liu Qigan used three flat tones

839
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,400
so blue

840
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,400
did you write

841
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,400
What about the Yangtze River?

842
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,400
Rush away from this Chongshan Junning

843
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,400
Wait for that kind of momentum

844
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,400
And the voice he used at the beginning is the first voice

845
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,400
Reinforce this with sound first

846
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,400
a voice like this

847
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,400
It's Peda's deep thinking

848
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,400
and since ancient times

849
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,400
Almost no one dares to use it like this

850
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,400
but he was writing that

851
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,600
This risk is going to end that kind of misfortune

852
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,600
He used what was fair to me

853
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,800
On the one hand, it is a team of mercy

854
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,800
On the one hand, the team that died

855
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,800
Let's look at Cixing first

856
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,200
Department of high position three under positive

857
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,400
Qutan Purchasing Department labor officer

858
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,600
Qutan Xia

859
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,600
You see a named proper noun

860
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,400
this is very fair

861
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,000
This is called the public team

862
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
High order

863
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,600
is an adverb

864
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,000
this writes this verb

865
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,200
What kind of adverb is this monk?

866
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,200
Sanxiazhengbu labor officer is another noun

867
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,200
a named

868
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,200
And the number of teammates

869
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,200
Third Team Headquarters

870
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,200
so it's very fair to me

871
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,200
Everyone knows

872
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,200
to my one

873
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:13,520
The importance is because its semantics and words are fair, so it appears very heavy

874
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:24,320
As for its evaluation power, you can see that its height is three crosses, this, review, review this, review this, this, review

875
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:37,320
So the following two sentences use such fair confrontation and language, this commentary to write the dangerous medicine under the majestic prayer hall of Baidi City

876
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,920
This is what a master like Dufu can do

877
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:52,720
Then birth and death were very important to the ancients.

878
00:49:52,720 --> 00:50:00,120
He also slowly realized that in fact, when he was in the church

879
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
We all know an unfinished song

880
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:14,000
The unfinished song is the song by Wang Wei, Yuan Ershi, and Anxi

881
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
If you take his evaluation ability as an example for this song

882
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
He's out of line

883
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Because of the second and third plays

884
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:32,000
He is not sticky, it is the evaluation power of two sentences

885
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
not roughly the same

886
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
but the opposite

887
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
This is unreasonable in the drama

888
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
but he is a song

889
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
he wants to break away from the form of poetry

890
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
out of poetic form

891
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
He will pay attention to this tone

892
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
So the poem reads

893
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Why can we get together

894
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,760
because it has several key points

895
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:14,200
Its tone has changed from a critical force to a very rigorous tone

896
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,600
Never encountered a thousand layers

897
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,600
That position must be born

898
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,600
Ke Shi Qian Qian Liu Shi Xian

899
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,700
The word Liu Shi must be sprinkled into life

900
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Qianqian, closer to a glass of wine

901
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,600
The one that rises with the glass of wine

902
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,600
can't change

903
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,200
Sucking Vinegar Yang Guang Wu Guren

904
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,400
that sucks to level up

905
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,600
Vinegar needs to be born

906
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,200
Wu Pingsheng Gu Qusheng

907
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,800
look at everyone

908
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,000
in four sentences

909
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,600
Its tone is so tight

910
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,600
can do so

911
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,980
Proving that the ring is unfeasible

912
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:06,980
Especially Su Dongpo, who was acquired by everyone

913
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,980
What he wrote failed

914
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:13,980
This rule dare not change at all

915
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,980
prove that he is talking

916
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:24,980
Just how the birth rate is already

917
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:32,980
Good drop rate, let me stop here

918
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,980
what's next

919
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,980
It is the problem of the sound part in this sentence

920
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,980
clef problems

921
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,980
because

922
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,980
Monophonic interpretation of our Chinese language

923
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,980
but

924
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,980
Too many homophones

925
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,980
So we use the adverb

926
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,980
to make up

927
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:57,980
for example

928
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:58,980
poetry

929
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
do you know what it is

930
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
That's fine, teacher

931
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
The teacher is here, so do you still dare to sit here?

932
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
He only because of the voice

933
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Add a word to make a character, and become an adverb

934
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
because adverbs are basically two words

935
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
for the unit

936
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Because our Chinese monosyllabic can be independent

937
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
The form of the syllable is basically

938
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
two or one syllable

939
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
For example, just now we said

940
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,000
brocade design, groundless, nothing, string

941
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
This syllable has four syllables

942
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
In these four syllables

943
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:54,000
It stops for a long or short period of ten years

944
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I read this sentence again

945
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
brocade design, groundless, nothing, string

946
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
that's snow

947
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
you can hear it

948
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
that snow

949
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
very long voice

950
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
because it is a place with hard corners

951
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
sentimental words

952
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
one of

953
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
completion point

954
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
so important

955
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
long voice

956
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
half way station in seven words

957
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
the endless end

958
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
besides

959
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
The scenery in four words

960
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
voice point

961
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
But what?

962
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
The stone of fifty strings

963
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
this place

964
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Because there is a big gap in the top

965
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
how about one below

966
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Finish

967
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
one episode up

968
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Its vocal pauses are very small

969
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
everybody

970
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
what does this affect

971
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Your brother's recitation

972
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Yin Chung

973
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
and song

974
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
ah

975
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
What is the original one?

976
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Inside Yinxue, Inside Music

977
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
if he is lively

978
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
will add some so-called pronouns

979
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,000
The joining point of the word is closely related to these

980
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
and clumsy

981
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
So wait a minute Shidhi says

982
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
his Yin Yong

983
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
You can see it in singing

984
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
if i sing a line

985
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
For example, the brocade dance with five and four strings

986
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
use free words

987
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Golden dancing fifty strings

988
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
So mark that long end

989
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
This is a so-called

990
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
syllable form

991
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
syllable form

992
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
my teacher

993
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Professor Cheng Chin-Cheng In-Bow

994
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
He found that the ancients did not notice

995
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
a very important phenomenon

996
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:13,000
That is, the syllable form starts to have single and double

997
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:19,000
That is, monosyllables and double syllables

998
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:26,000
These two syllables are very different in language melody

999
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:33,000
And what should be double can't use single, what should be single can't use double

1000
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Otherwise, you just don’t understand, the words you make will not match, and the music you made up with Jili will be Huangjiang Zuoban

1001
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Since two words are one syllable, two words are of course double syllables

1002
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I will practice sentences with more than three characters for you

1003
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Foot spit makes the bird next to the left bone enter the grain factory, establish the country and destroy the king of Mocheng. This is the syllable form of Eryi.

1004
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Turn Zhuge, set up the father, and teach martial arts. This is the form of one or two syllables.

1005
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
The former is a single syllable, and the latter is a double syllable.

1006
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:38,000
For four characters, ask heroes, and one and three are also the characters for Xinjiaxian.

1007
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Red gold emerald embroidery, two two.

1008
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
All the Book of Songs, four characters.

1009
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Watch Uncle Ju, in the boat of harmony.

1010
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:00,000
In all poetry and strict poetry, there is only one form in the poem, the double syllable of Erer.

1011
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Five words in the poem must be two two one is two three

1012
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Inch sleep is not the smallest

1013
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
stylized bird everywhere

1014
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
or the moonlight in front of the window

1015
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
The frost on the ground of the ceremony is two or three

1016
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
but in the lyrics

1017
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
for example

1018
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Broken people are not willow flowers

1019
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
sex with others

1020
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
so what

1021
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
just three two

1022
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
So there are single and double

1023
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
For example, six words

1024
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
bitter vine old tree faint crow

1025
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Xiaoqiao Liushui people

1026
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
this is six words

1027
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
222 Double Yinjie

1028
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
But what's the final plan?

1029
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
If there is no form, there is a winning style, just three-three

1030
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
What about seven characters?

1031
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
That is

1032
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
the poem must be

1033
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
About Qin Shinian

1034
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Chinese time

1035
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
thousands of miles

1036
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Great Wall

1037
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
late

1038
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Yellow River

1039
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
on the rock

1040
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Bu Yingqian

1041
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
are all

1042
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
two two two one

1043
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
The initial score is four three

1044
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
The initial score is three

1045
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
But from the inside of the poem

1046
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
for example

1047
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Huang Luan

1048
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Bai Ping

1049
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
intersection

1050
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
point

1051
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Akie

1052
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
white road

1053
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
desert

1054
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
not from

1055
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Yanpo

1056
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
hanging hands

1057
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Open

1058
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
it's all up and down

1059
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Why should the lower half of the moon be used as

1060
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
build

1061
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
vagina

1062
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
What about the basis of single and double?

1063
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
because of the lower half of the vagina

1064
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
no

1065
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
what is this

1066
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
not there

1067
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
point of completion

1068
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
just have both

1069
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Completion of business school meaning

1070
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,500
It's important, so the following half-syllable shall prevail

1071
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:13,500
Teacher Zheng Qian said that the double-vision syllable is an indirect keynote

1072
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:21,500
Double vision syllable is smooth rest

1073
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,500
What do you see these two?

1074
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,500
Double vision is an indirect keynote, double vision is stable and comfortable

1075
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,000
If a tune he tells you it's slow

1076
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Then may I ask his syllable form, it is definitely a double vision syllable

1077
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
If he told you Jiquzi Ji Sangun

1078
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
That must be a monovision syllable

1079
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
And what's more, single and double use

1080
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
If there are many single-vision syllables, it must be fast

1081
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
If there are many double-vision syllables, it will be slower

1082
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,500
Same tune, if the mass velocity is the same

1083
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
identical

1084
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,480
What if you put this

1085
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,480
The form of this syllable

1086
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,040
Mistaken

1087
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,420
Mistaken

1088
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,860
then the whole tone changes

1089
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,960
For example we

1090
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:22,400
There is a saying in high school Chinese liberal arts

1091
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,960
bitter mouse

1092
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,960
mosquito duck

1093
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,120
small bridge

1094
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,120
running water

1095
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,120
people

1096
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,120
ancient road

1097
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,120
west wind

1098
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,120
Shuma

1099
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,220
sunset

1100
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,220
go west

1101
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,480
What do you think next?

1102
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,320
used to be

1103
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,620
The punctuation says that the heartbroken man is at the end of the world

1104
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,040
mine

1105
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,200
review textbooks

1106
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,880
I keep saying this is wrong

1107
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,880
to read

1108
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,420
heartbroken man at the end of the world

1109
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,200
Because the syllable forms are different

1110
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,200
the sound is different

1111
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
why is it like this

1112
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,900
It's just that he didn't figure out a sentence

1113
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:10,560
Structural form of meaning

1114
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,800
and a syllabic form

1115
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:18,860
syllable structure form

1116
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:22,300
so make your way

1117
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,420
got me in the union

1118
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:28,720
I paid for a magazine to write an article about people in Tianya without punctuation

1119
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:32,220
My friends didn't even read it and thought I was revealing the world

1120
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:37,220
In fact, I'm just explaining this problem

1121
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,220
everybody

1122
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:44,720
Let's take the one that everyone will memorize

1123
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,220
Su Dongpo's water melody song head

1124
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:50,720
to verify verify

1125
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,720
Single and double forms of his syllable

1126
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,720
when is the moon

1127
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:00,720
Ask about the wine

1128
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I don't know God but

1129
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Ten years to this evening, I want to ride the wind and go home

1130
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Fear of poverty

1131
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Fifthly, what's the matter with Qingyan?

1132
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Turning to Zhuge, low ups and downs, sleepless

1133
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
There should be no hate

1134
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
people have joys and sorrows

1135
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:44,000
The moon is cloudy and sunny, Yan is sure that this accident is hard to choose

1136
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I hope people will live together for a long time

1137
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Have you noticed the alternate use of single and double syllables in poetry?

1138
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I can't read it, I want to go home with the wind, right?

1139
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
just slow down

1140
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
because it is the syllable form of 2 2 2

1141
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Gudao this

1142
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
There are dozens of bright moons

1143
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
it is monosyllabic

1144
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Second half of Jijukaku low class

1145
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Nursing cotton is called Fantuo in Magnetic Tuning

1146
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
That is to say, the front

1147
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
two doses are ten syllables

1148
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
split into two doses

1149
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Its destiny is ten syllables

1150
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
More than seven syllables must be broken

1151
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
break apart

1152
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
separate this two sentences

1153
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
separate way

1154
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
can be divided differently

1155
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
but be sure to lock

1156
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
its syllable form

1157
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
for example

1158
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
There are dozens of bright moons

1159
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Eighty-nine questions to the blue sky

1160
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
It splits into two doses

1161
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Those few examples, like the "Yi Meiren" we read just now, he said that A Jin listened to Confucianism and used his voice.

1162
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Take a look, everyone, Jiangkou Yun's Broken Flame is called West Wind, and it collapses into two sentences of four or five, but it is also a beauty.

1163
01:05:42,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Ronaldinho left and right Dongfeng, his home country can't bear to look back, the more people, right?

1164
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,400
Dan's syllable

1165
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,600
After this collapse is also a double syllable

1166
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,600
a danse syllable

1167
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,400
This broken benchmark is just that

1168
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,000
Everyone, look at what Su Dongtan is writing about.

1169
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:21,400
Mid-Autumn Moon of the Moon Yunhan Silent Rotary Wing Disc

1170
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:25,400
How does it slowly turn in the air

1171
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,200
turn the moon

1172
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,600
Go to the red screw flag

1173
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:36,600
Low up and low down on the fallen lock window

1174
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,000
last five years

1175
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Shining on the sleepless Su Dongtan

1176
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,400
Everyone, look at the moon is slowly turning

1177
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:53,000
So it uses this short sentence of three words

1178
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
it uses double syllables

1179
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,000
It's been five years since Zhuanzhu's low

1180
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,880
If you guys turn it upside down and try it

1181
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,280
Zhuge Chuan started the first sleepless omen

1182
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,680
Does the moon jump in the sky?

1183
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,720
So this melody

1184
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,720
between words

1185
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:19,520
We need to pay attention to matching and complementing each other.

1186
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:24,320
It's all very good for this example

1187
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,320
and everyone

1188
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,600
This sound thief form is so important

1189
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,760
But what about ordinary people?

1190
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,640
often

1191
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:37,680
without separating it from the form of meaning structure

1192
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,640
For example, we are citing

1193
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,720
beware of this poem

1194
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,720
beware of this poem

1195
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:51,320
What about us because of time?

1196
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,720
picture

1197
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:57,280
Changhai reading free from tears

1198
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,120
There are voices in the southern sky

1199
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,000
If you say to send poison, you must send poison like this

1200
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
But when it comes to understanding this poem

1201
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:17,000
interpret it in the form of meaning structure

1202
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,000
That is to say, the structural form of meaning, because the structural form exists simultaneously

1203
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:29,000
But often the structure is different

1204
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:36,000
If you mistakenly use the consonant form as the meaning form

1205
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
The taste of poetry is often weakened by this

1206
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,000
sometimes wrong

1207
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I have this example, but it will take a long time to analyze today

1208
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,000
If you use the meaning form to make the sound knot form to send poison

1209
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,000
That must have ruined the whole

1210
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,500
What is this? The melody of language

1211
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:05,280
that we just said

1212
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:09,040
breaker in the end of the world

1213
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,400
What about this sentence, if you check

1214
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,440
Other Tianjingsha Qupai

1215
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,440
picture

1216
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:20,360
I jumped back again, what is it like this?

1217
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,880
Ma Zhiyuan's

1218
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,820
It's not Ma Zhiyuan, what about Qiaoji?

1219
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:28,780
The same path to kill

1220
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I'm not saying

1221
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
It's not this bridge pole, this one, the other one

1222
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,500
Baipu, Baipu's Heavenly Path

1223
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,000
What is the last sentence?

1224
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:42,740
yes

1225
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,840
This white grass, red leaves and yellow flowers

1226
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,340
white grass red leaves yellow flowers

1227
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:54,500
Then this is the meaning form and the negative solution form

1228
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,500
Compatible

1229
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:56,740
match

1230
01:09:56,740 --> 01:10:00,240
If you say that there will be mountains of traffic

1231
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,520
That's not white grass with red leaves and yellow flowers

1232
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,000
Wait a second and another example

1233
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,920
let's talk

1234
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,000
like this one just now

1235
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,200
"The Canghai Reading Names Are Listed"

1236
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:24,000
If you also use "Canghai Reading All Lists"

1237
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
becomes two sentences

1238
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
The name of Canghai is listed

1239
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
the more you have

1240
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Canghai is used to describe Yueming as its number

1241
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
There are many

1242
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
what are you

1243
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
all are verbs

1244
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Column Longevity words

1245
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
form two sentences

1246
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
There may be this sentence about British relations

1247
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
In this way

1248
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
still can steal

1249
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
but if you know

1250
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
The poem needs to be interpreted

1251
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
everybody

1252
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,800
First find out his poetic words for a sentence

1253
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:06,340
The eye of poetry is

1254
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:10,840
what the poet wants to emphasize

1255
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,840
The word that meets him at the core

1256
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,040
called poetry

1257
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,000
In fact, he used

1258
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,840
Using pig Han Yu as a metaphor for himself

1259
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,160
What is this pig?

1260
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,320
It's the Pearl of the Moon

1261
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,620
Le

1262
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:39,320
I, Li Sanyin, are like a pig

1263
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:43,120
And this pig is in the sea

1264
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,120
Canghai fish pig

1265
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:47,120
no one uses it well

1266
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,320
I'm an animal bird

1267
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:55,620
There are so many talented people in Yueming

1268
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:57,780
shine bright like the moon

1269
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:59,780
I am a pig so full of my light

1270
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
How can light be revealed?

1271
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Therefore, the Changhai Yue nationality

1272
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,000
So he has his seven or two sorrows

1273
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Nantian Rinuan has the same heart

1274
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
to take away his gentlemanly conduct

1275
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
This Nantian because of He Changhai

1276
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
this to me

1277
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
So there is no need to look at it as a local celebrity

1278
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Nan Tian is just Billi's wilderness

1279
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
In this Billy's wilderness

1280
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
his sunshine

1281
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
this jade is in it

1282
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
appeared so gentle

1283
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
what is it called

1284
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
A light above the shadows

1285
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
The light of sound and smoke is on

1286
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
That is to say

1287
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,000
He sticks to the conduct of a gentleman

1288
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
compare yourself with

1289
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
But this smoke

1290
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:08,000
It also makes people feel that it is impossible to last forever

1291
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:16,000
So the form of a syllable and syllable are often different like this

1292
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,000
This is what we usually ignore

1293
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:26,000
This syllable form is also very important

1294
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
The other is the festive form of the phrase

1295
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:46,000
In the festival form of words and sentences, there are lexical festivals related to sound and emotion

1296
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:53,000
For example, like Shuangsheng, like Dele, and Dezisheng, father and son

1297
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:58,000
This father and son with word dimension

1298
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
this is a

1299
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,800
And what about this? It's related to sweating and love.

1300
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:10,100
Twins because it has the same biological mother

1301
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:15,300
For example, the yellow flower has the same biological mother

1302
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,000
Green willow, the same birth mother

1303
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:22,800
So what's that about it, animated and sliding

1304
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,100
will look brisk

1305
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:30,100
get pregnant because the pregnant mother is the same

1306
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,400
Pregnant mothers will respond

1307
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:37,100
So it looks like it's slower than this

1308
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,800
get pregnant more slowly

1309
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,900
Derived from the word biomass

1310
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:52,200
The second word is actually the ending of the first word.

1311
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:57,700
Because the emphasis of the two words is strengthened in sound and the meaning is the same

1312
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,200
rolling or rolling mean

1313
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Seeking or looking for meaning

1314
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,000
However, using the

1315
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,000
a change in life

1316
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,000
For example, like Li Shangyan

1317
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Li Shang played his most famous song "Slow Life"

1318
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
"Slow Life" strictly says

1319
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
What I just said is the double-eyed greeter

1320
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Weights are very slow

1321
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:34,000
But he wants to describe the urgency of his own state of mind

1322
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Looking for the secret, slowly and lightly, ginseng, lightly

1323
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
It becomes faster, and the relationship changes

1324
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:51,000
That is to say, the elements of the original melody of the process

1325
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
There are also strong and weak

1326
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Strongly manifested when present at the same time

1327
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,000
The weak one will be shadowed

1328
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,240
There are virtuous distinctions

1329
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:09,440
Tofu is very good at using twins to conceive

1330
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:15,560
Someone counted a lot of verses about tofu twins getting pregnant

1331
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,840
So I miss reading it

1332
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:23,040
Especially touching in terms of voice and emotion

1333
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:28,240
For example, he sang Wang Qianqiu and flicked the buds

1334
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,400
the depression generation was different at the same time

1335
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,400
hope to get pregnant

1336
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:37,960
Twins

1337
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:41,840
get pregnant

1338
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,720
in seven words

1339
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,840
He has three legs and has twins

1340
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:53,240
Depression Generation Depression Gets Pregnant

1341
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,440
A generation is also pregnant

1342
01:16:55,440 --> 01:17:00,040
Pay attention to this kind of master

1343
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I also said just now, everyone, look at the Tianjingsha at the bridge pole on the fifth page

1344
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:16,000
As Tianjingsha just said, bone vines, old trees, faint crows

1345
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I wrote about the scenery of this autumn

1346
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Instead, I used the Double Vision Film Festival

1347
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Guteng old tree and faint crow are very vast

1348
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:42,000
But when it comes to spring, we use the word "extend material" for bridge poles

1349
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
it's totally different

1350
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:51,000
英英英英英英春春花花流

1351
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
True and true

1352
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
stop and go

1353
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Stop and go everyone

1354
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
take the heart of spring

1355
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
The momentum of the thousand yuan also came out

1356
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:12,000
The ancients were very particular about the combination of affection and compassion.

1357
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Then the structure of other words and sentences, thimble storage, or Beijing opera, etc.

1358
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Then I do not talk about it

1359
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I am here to strengthen a few short stories for you to listen to

1360
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:35,000
One is deliberation, deliberation, deliberation, the word

1361
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I heard it's fake

1362
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
He's a bitter poet, you know the bitter poet

1363
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
What about him

1364
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Suddenly got two poems

1365
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
he said this

1366
01:18:53,000 --> 01:19:00,000
ornithology lexicographer birds are already in

1367
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,560
He fell asleep on the tree next to him

1368
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:06,400
under the moon

1369
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,240
He was born again

1370
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,400
Is it better to push or knock?

1371
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,840
Just speculate there

1372
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,840
It just hit my golden eyes

1373
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:19,840
Han Yu

1374
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,340
After Hanyu found out

1375
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,440
think about him now

1376
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:32,880
It is said that he broke three beards in a row to figure it out

1377
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:37,280
In fact, if we take the melody in words as an example

1378
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:38,880
look

1379
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,980
two tree holding edge tree

1380
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:44,780
It's very quiet, isn't it?

1381
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:46,740
closed back

1382
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:49,440
under the moon

1383
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,640
There is a moon and it closes at night and comes back

1384
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:56,440
knock on the door

1385
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:58,440
all

1386
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,920
We can still choose to be a typewriter and his reasons

1387
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:17,480
I think knocking should be based on the influence of the loud and dark voice

1388
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:22,200
There is also abnormal sound in the pushing sound system

1389
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:26,280
but want to rely on

1390
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:33,120
Everyone knows why the zero realm was created

1391
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:38,600
The remnant woods are particularly quiet

1392
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:43,640
Why is Niaosing Mountain better?

1393
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:50,000
This is a kind of contrast between movement and stillness.

1394
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,880
Stillness and a living thing appear more inside

1395
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:59,480
say one night in the movie

1396
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Shrimp plays the slow flute, and it is also very quiet, the reason is the same, it also needs the combination of raw affection and compassion.

1397
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:30,000
In the same way, like the Du Muzhi that everyone will memorize, Qingming, the real world and the chaos, and the pedestrians on the road are also scattered. May I ask where are the Jiujia?

1398
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Wooden barrel, Yaozi, Xianhuachun, some people say that this song is really badly written, because it is called Qingming, and there is a Qingming at the beginning, and it is already Qingming, so why bother?

1399
01:21:48,000 --> 01:22:01,000
It is not necessary to say the word Qingming. Everyone knows that it is Qingming, and the pedestrians on the road are scattered. This road is even more wonderful. Is this sentence really bad?

1400
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,400
Is it cloudy on bed spectrum?

1401
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,900
Of course pedestrians are on the road.

1402
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,600
So there is no need on the road

1403
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,200
This asks Jiujia where to travel

1404
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,700
Jiujia where to travel is already asking

1405
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,200
What else do you want to ask?

1406
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:17,400
The purpose is in drinking

1407
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,200
Who told you that your surname is Huachun

1408
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,100
I don't want wooden barrels

1409
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,700
It's good that Yaozi's surname is Huachun

1410
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:24,600
as long as someone tells you to be there

1411
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,600
So such a poem is called

1412
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,600
word part word waste

1413
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,400
Pointless

1414
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,800
should be

1415
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:34,700
listen carefully

1416
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:37,300
I read the two poems again

1417
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:40,800
Everyone is separated from the words and expressions

1418
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,100
to judge the two poems

1419
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:46,600
It's better to change before or not to change

1420
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:51,000
The Qingming Era and the Succession

1421
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,700
Pedestrians on the road stopped again

1422
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,100
This asks Jiujia where to travel

1423
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:00,100
barrel shaker

1424
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Youzi's surname is Hanamura

1425
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
the world and

1426
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Pedestrian dies again

1427
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
where is the restaurant

1428
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Shaker's surname is Hanamura

1429
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
everybody

1430
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
youth

1431
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
give people the feeling

1432
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
still a beautiful thing

1433
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
it can be said again and again

1434
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Everyone is not tired

1435
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
How much have you been in love

1436
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
when we were in love

1437
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
to your girlfriend all the time

1438
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
boyfriend says i love you

1439
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
he is not a suspect

1440
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
So the feeling of youth

1441
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
he is very sweet

1442
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
a wonderful season

1443
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
family reunion

1444
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
so young

1445
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
more embellishment

1446
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
dotted urban vocabulary

1447
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
this way

1448
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:06,040
It also shows that this poet has fallen to the end of the world

1449
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:09,480
emphasized this

1450
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,960
This asks you to see how gentle this human being is

1451
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,960
what is this

1452
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:19,000
The image of spring, the end of the world, the scenery

1453
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,000
short enemy on the back of a bull

1454
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
are beautiful images

1455
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
So this in this sense

1456
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
is absolutely non-recurring

1457
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
That is to say, to observe

1458
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
it is necessary

1459
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Sentimentally speaking

1460
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Blowing poetry

1461
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
it is

1462
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
has four steps

1463
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
so

1464
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Teng Luoshu Xu

1465
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
This cotton cut with twists and turns

1466
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
The Wuyan poem is missing one syllable

1467
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
it looks like this

1468
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
push out a little

1469
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
light spring

1470
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:07,000
The mood of the virtuous and enmity who left people falling to the horizon

1471
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
not a big guy

1472
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
No big coffee

1473
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
So of course the original is good

1474
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,000
But this poem is uniquely made like this

1475
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Qingming Esperanto

1476
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
pedestrians on the road

1477
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Desperate

1478
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Where can I ask Jiujia?

1479
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
wooden barrel

1480
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Yaozi

1481
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
County flower village

1482
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
look at everyone

1483
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
it does not change a word

1484
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
but what has changed

1485
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
change what we call theater

1486
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
playground

1487
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
what rhymes with this

1488
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
rhyme change

1489
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
syllable form change

1490
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
So these changes

1491
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
The whole voice is different

1492
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Because this can also be seen

1493
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
What about the above?

1494
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Also give an example

1495
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
you have more to say

1496
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,000
So about the accent?

1497
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
singing problem

1498
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Even though I didn't have time to say

1499
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
but i believe

1500
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
What about him

1501
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
If you can master

1502
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
This language degree

1503
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
the basic words

1504
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
then again

1505
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
to read our literature

1506
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
as a criticism

1507
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Or as this appreciation

1508
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
are helpful

1509
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
if musician singer lyricist

1510
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Also be able to understand some of the basic concepts

1511
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I believe it also helps

1512
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
So what about time?

1513
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
if in

1514
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
teacher

1515
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
while singing

1516
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
no explanation

1517
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
no explanation

1518
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:06,000
So now everyone applauds and welcomes him to demonstrate

1519
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Mr. Zheng and all the scholars and experts present

1520
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
First of all I want to express my great honor

1521
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
And to be here today for this holy congregation

1522
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I want to thank the assembly very much

1523
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Thank you Teacher Zheng for giving me this opportunity

1524
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Just now, Mr. Zheng is already very academic.

1525
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
very regularly put each

1526
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
There are some theories about the relationship between poetry and music

1527
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
made a very clear formula

1528
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I have attended Teacher Zheng's class for seven years

1529
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
I am teacher Zheng's student

1530
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Then I very much hope that Teacher Zheng's theory

1531
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
prove it to the music

1532
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
So when I appreciate poetry

1533
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
set it to music

1534
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
in what the teacher calls the syllable form

1535
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
And what should be paid attention to in the teacher's rhyme angle

1536
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
What is more important is the melody of the language

1537
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
with music

1538
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,300
Many of our music friends say

1539
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:07,000
Language has tones but no melody

1540
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,500
Mr. Na Zeng put forward the language melody

1541
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:14,300
When many foreigners are learning Chinese

1542
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:17,000
He can't grasp the melody of the language

1543
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
so when they talk

1544
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:25,000
I'm going to the Academia Sinica today to listen to Professor Zeng's smoke

1545
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,500
He narrates one thing all on the same pitch

1546
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:31,500
so we feel a lot like a robot talking

1547
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:34,500
When we usually talk, there are high and low and easy

1548
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:37,000
It's what the teacher called four tones

1549
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,500
That is the combination of language and melody

1550
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:45,500
There is a sung Puli's libretto today

1551
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:49,500
Then I want to say that I followed what Teacher Zeng said just now.

1552
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:53,000
The collocation of syllable form and language melody

1553
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,500
I'll just jump to demonstrate

1554
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:58,000
I want to sing this dedicated thread first

1555
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
It was written by Li Bai

1556
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,080
Written by the bright moonlight in front of the bed, frost on the ground

1557
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,840
Looking up at the moon, looking down at the homeland

1558
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:10,240
Teacher aunt's syllable division is preceded by three

1559
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:14,600
The bright moonlight in front of the bed is the syllable form of two and three

1560
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,240
So when taking the spectrum

1561
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,880
will place that syllable gap

1562
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,520
The melody is a little longer

1563
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,720
In fact, Mr. Zeng didn't mention it today.

1564
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:25,520
he speaks in class

1565
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,280
a poem can send win sing sing

1566
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,720
So a song we are very familiar with

1567
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:34,320
Everyone is catchy and will recite it

1568
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,080
But I don't remember

1569
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:39,720
The situation of Mr. Li Baiyuan is here

1570
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:42,640
The bright moonlight in front of the bed is frost on the ground

1571
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:45,680
Looking up at the moon, looking down at the homeland

1572
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:48,080
There's no emotion in it anymore

1573
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,920
The thought of this

1574
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,240
the way we chant

1575
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:54,680
clear its syllable form

1576
01:29:54,680 --> 01:30:00,000
The bright moonlight in front of the bed

1577
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
frost on the ground

1578
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,760
Raise your head and look at the bright moon

1579
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:10,240
Bow your head and miss your hometown

1580
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,040
Do you feel

1581
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:15,360
There is a little more emotion in it than the first reading

1582
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:18,680
Then the next song is the singing part

1583
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,000
It is composed by my teacher Fu Xueyi

1584
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,560
The way I sing with shadowsong

1585
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:25,360
let everyone feel

1586
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,640
Ancient poems

1587
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,440
poetry with music

1588
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:30,720
Beauty with music

1589
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:34,300
Teacher Fu's theory is very close to Teacher Zeng's

1590
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,840
So when he composed the music

1591
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:37,380
melody of language

1592
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:38,660
just by virtue of

1593
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:40,720
high pitch

1594
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,520
Appreciation is down and then up

1595
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:45,320
The resulting boosting effect

1596
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:47,880
That is to say, it is relatively unlikely to cause the situation

1597
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:49,920
Division of Syllable Forms

1598
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:52,480
Guess everyone will understand him

1599
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,280
poetic situation

1600
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:14,400
Frost on the ground for a while

1601
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:29,740
counties

1602
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:38,240
Sincerely

1603
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:46,640
Is it possible to present the situation of Li Bai missing his family?

1604
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,040
So I just have three layers

1605
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:49,740
one is sending camp

1606
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,040
then this is the song

1607
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:56,040
In fact, if the song is accompanied by a contract, it is a painted song, a soft song

1608
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:57,740
with the accompaniment of the contract

1609
01:31:57,740 --> 01:31:59,940
His art form will be higher

1610
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,660
then this is a poem

1611
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:04,220
According to the teacher's so-called division of syllable forms

1612
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:08,500
In the light, in the frost, in the fragrance, this rhyming place

1613
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,220
drag it a long note

1614
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:14,840
then it will be able to show the feeling of its contraction more

1615
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:16,140
that runs through

1616
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:20,020
You are more contagious with this nostalgia for home.

1617
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:21,880
then this one

1618
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:24,140
There is a poem with seven words

1619
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:25,200
This is five words

1620
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,140
His syllable form is two plus three

1621
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:32,260
The first part of this book is a poem written by Mr. Zeng

1622
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:34,660
Teacher, would you like to explain his background?

1623
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:37,940
one year

1624
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:41,780
i lead a video team

1625
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:46,340
Just to get rid of the six giant empty clusters in the mainland

1626
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:48,700
their classic jumbo

1627
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:50,140
in 1992

1628
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:53,820
We recorded 135 out

1629
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:57,740
The empty giant actor at that time

1630
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:59,260
Both are around 50 years old

1631
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,600
It is the time when the art of Fenghua is at its highest

1632
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,600
we record it

1633
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:11,100
This is Xiangkun from Spring Table in Hunan

1634
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:16,200
The video team of our China Folk Art Foundation team

1635
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:19,200
That is, the professor also went

1636
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:24,200
We boarded this Suxian Ridge

1637
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:27,200
This Su Xianling can see the whole spring table

1638
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:31,200
And the spring table is the

1639
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:34,600
Qin Guan, the great poet of the Song Dynasty

1640
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:37,100
where he was held

1641
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:39,100
Who would he say?

1642
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:41,100
there are two sentences

1643
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:47,400
Said Chunjiang county son around Chunshan

1644
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:52,200
Precious water flows down to dissipate the fragrance

1645
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:57,100
Chunjiang is lucky to be able to embrace Chunshan

1646
01:33:57,100 --> 01:34:00,100
The Fragrance of Shanshui

1647
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,600
It is a scene of fit between the world

1648
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:08,600
But in the end why did you stay in Xiaoxiang?

1649
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:12,600
And finally leave the North?

1650
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:15,600
This hatred is very elegant

1651
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,600
What about after I climb up?

1652
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,600
Opposition

1653
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,600
So I wrote this song

1654
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,600
we read it again

1655
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:29,200
Su Xian leading the Wangchun table

1656
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:33,200
Mountains and rivers can't help ancient hatred

1657
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:37,200
Why bother spring mountains bear spring water

1658
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:41,200
Elegance from hatred in the world

1659
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,200
I mean

1660
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,200
There are many hatreds in the world

1661
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:49,200
to be able to last forever

1662
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:53,200
like mountains and rivers

1663
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:57,200
Mountains are not as big as water

1664
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:00,200
Water is not as high as mountains

1665
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:06,040
It's just the state of reciprocating each other and gaining each other

1666
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:08,700
it's hard i mean like this

1667
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:11,200
At that time, what about Professor Xu?

1668
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:14,840
He was suddenly moved and he threw him out

1669
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:18,340
So this song is indeed made by me

1670
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:25,500
That was very touching. My teacher improvised this song.

1671
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:28,200
Then our whole regiment sees the word

1672
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:32,800
Then my feeling is the worry of nostalgia

1673
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:35,600
then full of sentimental

1674
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:40,300
So when I compose the music, I use the comparison

1675
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:44,400
Or the more sad music melody

1676
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:47,000
That is in a few places that I want to emphasize

1677
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,400
That is, the syllable form is a structure of four and three

1678
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,400
So when I was composing the music, Su Xian led

1679
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,800
I'll pull that up, I'll pull a long note

1680
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:59,400
Cut his syllables Wang Chunzhou

1681
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:00,200
this state has

1682
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,300
Just pause a little longer than that

1683
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:04,600
Then the mountains and rivers do not weave

1684
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,200
this place will also pause

1685
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,900
The golden bone is thick and thick, and it will take a little longer

1686
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:10,600
probably to divide the syllables

1687
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:14,200
The second is the combination of language melody and music melody

1688
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,200
For example, the water of mountains and rivers

1689
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,700
Please save my melody for a while later

1690
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:22,800
I'm pulling up from the upstream water

1691
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,800
and golden bones

1692
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:28,300
It doesn't stop with a single sound

1693
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:32,100
I have a turning point to pull this appreciative sound

1694
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:34,500
The teacher taught us that this theory is

1695
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:37,100
put it on the score

1696
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:40,200
Then the world is free from hatred

1697
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:44,500
Wen Yong's very flat voice made him put that voice

1698
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:47,300
bring out the feeling of melancholy

1699
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:48,900
I don't know if everyone has this contagion

1700
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:50,500
try it

1701
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:57,700
Suxian Ridge

1702
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:00,700
Wangcheng

1703
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:20,000
I don't know the mountains and rivers, I worry about Jinggu

1704
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Why bother to sink mountains, lakes and city water, hate in the world, freedom is far away

1705
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Thanks

1706
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
I don't know if everyone has that kind of longing

1707
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Or very sad and helpless thoughts

1708
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I just apply the teacher's theory to Puqi

1709
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Able to express poetry in a more beautiful way

1710
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,000
There are also several examples

1711
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:17,000
For example, let’s sing that Mid-Autumn Festival first.

1712
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Mid-autumn night is also a

1713
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,000
I was looking for an ancient poem that I missed

1714
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
That is to say, don't say it's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

1715
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I usually hope that everyone can be reunited

1716
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
no reunion so there is a

1717
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
an emotional arrogance

1718
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,000
No reunion means separation

1719
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Pengdao and Shicheng

1720
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:45,000
In Shicheng is a very bright moon

1721
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
presented

1722
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
But Lu Chuang was a student

1723
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
a dry place

1724
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
So the situation is different on both sides

1725
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
can't be together

1726
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Who will accompany you to listen to your wind and rain

1727
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,720
without you

1728
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:03,400
this is my interpretation

1729
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:05,760
So what's the use of the bright moon?

1730
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,280
This is also the case

1731
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,720
then i composed it

1732
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,920
Because this Haoyue Weishen is relatively

1733
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,800
miss a more intense

1734
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:16,600
So I used the moon with a taller one

1735
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:17,880
one

1736
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:19,320
Yin ointment

1737
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,840
I miss the front

1738
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:22,680
so

1739
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:24,040
Comparing the advantages and disadvantages

1740
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:26,520
so many outstanding students

1741
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,600
I have a lot of good and bad

1742
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:29,600
So

1743
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,440
I used a stack

1744
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,400
here is

1745
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:34,160
How many outstanding students

1746
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:35,040
or how much

1747
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:35,800
how many

1748
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,840
How many advantages and disadvantages are there?

1749
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,280
So here's a

1750
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,480
Presentation of stacked belly pedals

1751
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:43,640
I just hope to put more good and bad

1752
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:44,800
do show

1753
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,440
I don't know if you can

1754
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:49,320
I can feel the situation when I am taking notes

1755
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:50,040
So

1756
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:52,480
This is a two-three yin form

1757
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,160
so less than

1758
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,400
autumn leaves

1759
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:57,520
How many outstanding students

1760
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,520
I also cut it a bit

1761
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
The teacher's theory is applied in poetry

1762
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:47,000
When one person encounters Shao Ke, Shi Cheng

1763
01:40:47,000 --> 01:41:00,000
There is no window in the good moon and sky

1764
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:12,000
The sound of sweat, who will listen to the sound of sweat?

1765
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:24,000
so far for whom

1766
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Fashion relationship, you can sing that song in Western characters.

1767
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Okay, fashion relationship, the teacher ordered me to end it quickly.

1768
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Okay, the last song the teacher wants to sing that

1769
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
ending with a western syllable

1770
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
There is usually a lot of this in fashion

1771
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
It is also an ancient poem of longing

1772
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:53,000
It was originally a hope that the beauty of the world will never be forgotten, and the Huai family cannot forget it.

1773
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Desperate dream, ground second blindness, it feels more grainy

1774
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
But if you add a west, hope the beautiful woman west

1775
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,700
so no defense

1776
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:07,700
he misses his wai family

1777
01:42:07,700 --> 01:42:11,700
last thought drives me crazy

1778
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:15,700
I would feel that he seemed to be caused by missing

1779
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:17,700
a very passionate emotion

1780
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:22,200
So later on I also raised him to a high pitch as a finishing touch

1781
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:25,900
In the front, because the acoustic piano and the Ciqin have to match each other

1782
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:27,900
so my tune is a little lower

1783
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:29,900
he has a feeling of nostalgia

1784
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:40,900
Beauties heartless defenseless

1785
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:50,400
Huai family can't forget

1786
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:58,400
Absolutely out of dreams

1787
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,400
How can

1788
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:06,000
peace of mind

1789
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:16,000
I'm crazy

1790
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I just put the theory of some of the teacher's poems

1791
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
applied to some comps

1792
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
I hope you still like it

1793
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,000
The teacher's theory is very rigorous and rich

1794
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I can only apply a small part of it

1795
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I hope you can understand

1796
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Thanks

1797
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Thanks

1798
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Thank you Professor Shi

1799
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,000
because of time

1800
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,000
we can't ask him to sing more

1801
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,000
He sang just now and I have two points to explain

1802
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:54,000
the syllable just said

1803
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
change from poem to word

1804
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
is the change of syllable

1805
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Sunshine Mountain Butterfly

1806
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Everyone, let me read Sunshine Mountain Butterfly to you all

1807
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
there are various places

1808
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:14,000
failed to meet

1809
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Unfulfilled morning encounter one morning one morning

1810
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Is it a mountain butterfly

1811
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
failed

1812
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
failed to meet

1813
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,000
unfulfilled morning

1814
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:33,000
So its syllables can change inside

1815
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Therefore, like the words of the Pucheng song

1816
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,000
If this syllable interstepping can also be applied

1817
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
It can also strengthen the sentiment

1818
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Use voice and emotion to strengthen what you must express in your words

1819
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
and that tin letter

1820
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Everyone, don't underestimate this tin letter

1821
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
look

1822
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Nahan

1823
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,400
Two people from Chu Han Xiangzheng

1824
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:07,600
Henkel Master Review Township

1825
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:12,600
Sing the wind rises, the wind rises and the wind rises, Yuan Feiyang

1826
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:18,600
Returning to the hometown for the family and the sea

1827
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:24,100
Antimons Sisuo Quartet

1828
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:25,900
because of this word

1829
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:30,100
So his imperial weather

1830
01:45:30,900 --> 01:45:35,100
His kind of light wind makes good luck

1831
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:39,900
the impossibility of the ego

1832
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:44,300
but feel lonely

1833
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:47,300
The loneliness after returning home

1834
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:49,400
and for him

1835
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:53,200
The kind of Chu singing of future grandparents and grandchildren

1836
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:57,300
Just because a Chinese word echoed around you

1837
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,600
If you remove the Western characters

1838
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,580
windy and cloudy

1839
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:05,340
return home return home

1840
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:08,340
Andre's fierce deeds

1841
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:09,540
very flat

1842
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:14,140
Not to mention Liba Shanxi

1843
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:16,840
Libashan gas cap chamber

1844
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:18,740
Stand still

1845
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:20,040
Can't catch up

1846
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:21,340
chase chase

1847
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:25,540
- that's weak, isn't it?

1848
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:26,740
But what?

1849
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:31,280
Liba Shanxi gas cap chamber

1850
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:32,980
Stand still

1851
01:46:32,980 --> 01:46:35,480
Can't catch up

1852
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:37,480
Can't catch up

1853
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:39,980
Yes, it's very weak

1854
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:43,980
one by one that is weak

1855
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:47,980
one by one that is weak

1856
01:46:47,980 --> 01:46:49,980
that's weak

1857
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,980
different

1858
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:53,980
Let me tell you another little story

1859
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:56,720
once

1860
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:58,720
in the age of spring and autumn

1861
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,760
a prince of chu

1862
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:07,820
A female heirloom of Vietnam

1863
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:11,780
rock her boat and sit on it

1864
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:16,040
This girl from Vietnam likes this prince very much

1865
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:17,980
Can't say it

1866
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:21,240
Then she sang a song

1867
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:25,680
There are two lines in the song that use symbolic metaphors

1868
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:27,760
this

1869
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:30,020
way of starting a letter

1870
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,460
to convey

1871
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:38,840
three purpose

1872
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:44,040
Your heart pleases you, your heart doesn't know

1873
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:47,160
Please remove that C

1874
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:52,240
Three eyes and a heart please you don't know

1875
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:55,240
no taste at all

1876
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:59,560
Why is the word C even though it is a function word?

1877
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,280
But he came back to you emotionally

1878
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:07,680
Make you a lot of associations

1879
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:10,360
you translate it into vernacular

1880
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:11,440
very simple

1881
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:13,240
there are trees on the hill

1882
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:15,040
trees with leaves

1883
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:16,840
I like you in my heart

1884
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:17,960
you do not know

1885
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,080
not interesting

1886
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:22,960
But you can sing it like this

1887
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:26,000
Mountain tree west

1888
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
tree branches

1889
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,680
Edison Junxi

1890
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:32,680
you

1891
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:34,880
you see you think of it

1892
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,840
there are trees on the hill

1893
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:37,680
tree branches

1894
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:40,080
is so obvious

1895
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:42,640
I like your heart

1896
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:44,360
can't be so obvious

1897
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:46,200
This is the first meaning

1898
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,160
second meaning

1899
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,280
there are trees on the hill

1900
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:50,120
how beautiful you look

1901
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:51,440
tree with leaves

1902
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:53,360
How beautiful

1903
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:56,720
how beautiful you are with me

1904
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:58,880
If there are no branches on the mountain

1905
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:00,040
no tree

1906
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
how ugly we want resources

1907
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
sell more

1908
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
if there is not

1909
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
we want you ain't sales

1910
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
many rich associations

1911
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
echoed in this detail

1912
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
this

1913
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
just love

1914
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
must

1915
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Bring out the best in each other

1916
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
this is us today

1917
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
speaking one

1918
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Rong said the subject

1919
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
same

1920
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Singing the wall chorus is not as good as words

1921
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
into the opera

1922
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
the whole music

1923
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Chorus is not as good as words

1924
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
This can lead to many

1925
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
what about now

1926
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Eleven minutes left

1927
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
can i

1928
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
delay ten minutes

1929
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
let everyone

1930
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Is it okay to ask

1931
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
come one to start

1932
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
please

1933
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
mostly great speeches

1934
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
besides

1935
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,760
Very nice singing, what I want to ask is this

1936
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:04,600
Just now the teacher was

1937
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:08,720
Li Shangying's scenery is useful for taking advantage of Changhai Yueming's main tour category

1938
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,800
Lantian Yunnuan Yu Shengyan

1939
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:11,840
explain to us

1940
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:14,800
Interpretation of a structural form and

1941
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:18,120
The structure of the vulva does not have to be exactly the same

1942
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:21,760
But today's speech also repeatedly mentioned that

1943
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:23,520
Yin Qing

1944
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,120
And the epidemic

1945
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:30,560
The mutual cooperation will be very close and will complement each other

1946
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,480
so i was thinking

1947
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,440
In the era of Li Shangying, even from ancient times to modern times

1948
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:38,600
as if i would feel

1949
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:42,400
Some poets of a certain level may disagree and say

1950
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:46,200
The Structural Form of Meaning and the Structural Form of the Vulva

1951
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:47,800
should be possible to separate

1952
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:50,160
I think most poets would expect

1953
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:51,800
they are together

1954
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:54,440
Whether a poet who writes poetry or a dancer

1955
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,000
Maybe we should think about it

1956
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:58,080
this is a personal idea

1957
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:59,560
so i want to know more

1958
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,600
I think the structural form of the meaning is separated

1959
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:07,400
What is the reason for reading separately from the structural form of the phonetic analysis?

1960
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:08,400
Thanks

1961
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:11,800
if you put

1962
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,200
works of five people

1963
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:16,100
same seven words teacher

1964
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:17,600
the same five-word teacher

1965
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:20,000
His phonetic form remains unchanged

1966
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:23,100
But you analyze what's in it

1967
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:24,900
meaning structure

1968
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:27,500
is compatible

1969
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,600
On the contrary, it is a minority

1970
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:33,000
Structural Forms of Meaning and Phonics

1971
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:34,800
Compatibility is a minority

1972
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:36,800
mostly

1973
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:38,600
changed

1974
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:40,900
Then why?

1975
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:44,400
Because his phonetic form is already the same

1976
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,200
private?

1977
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,100
when to create

1978
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:50,300
ask for his change

1979
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:51,400
change there

1980
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:54,000
in the form of his meaning structure

1981
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:55,000
Variety

1982
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:57,200
so it won't

1983
01:51:57,200 --> 01:51:59,300
even

1984
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,000
If the form does not change, the ancients called He Chang

1985
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:13,000
He Chang just didn't develop, not a good literary skill

1986
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:20,000
There are many examples, don't I have my six articles later?

1987
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
There is an article called "Language Melody of Chinese Poetry"

1988
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I have given many examples to illustrate this problem

1989
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,000
who else

1990
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Thanks to Teacher Zeng for his competitive speech, we can understand the beauty of classical poetry

1991
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I have a question, is it the opposite of classical poetry

1992
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:53,000
It has a history of about 100 years from the development of the vernacular movement to the present

1993
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:59,000
The biggest difference in classical poetry is now the musicality of the poems

1994
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
And Changhua is strange

1995
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
The resulting street is full of private

1996
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
but unintelligible

1997
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
disappointing

1998
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
I want to ask Mr. Zeng for advice

1999
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
modern is the status quo

2000
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Is it a turbulent flow

2001
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Or maybe it will become the norm in the future

2002
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
is it possible to return

2003
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Classical private holding

2004
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
have the spirit

2005
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
With nurturing and beauty

2006
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,000
OK, let me tell you the conclusion first

2007
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
I will analyze

2008
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
will return to

2009
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Application for resignation of language rights

2010
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,000
It's inevitable

2011
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
what is the reason

2012
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:46,000
China pays attention to vitality

2013
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
artificial force

2014
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,000
It is to make the application artificial aesthetic

2015
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,000
look at this effort

2016
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:59,000
From this Southern Dynasties

2017
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
really done

2018
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
The real completion has to go to Kun Ju

2019
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
What about Kunju?

2020
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:10,000
stun gun

2021
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
just one word

2022
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
totally blended in with his singing gun

2023
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,000
He not only pays attention to students' ability to adjust

2024
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,000
who is the force

2025
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
He is also particular

2026
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Fusion of the whole sound

2027
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,000
One word and three sounds

2028
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
self-conceited

2029
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
analyze the sound

2030
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
rejoin the music

2031
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Look how long the history is

2032
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Because of this language

2033
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
The problem of voice is

2034
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Complicated

2035
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
complex

2036
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
I brought it up today

2037
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,000
but the weaker one

2038
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
You can grasp it

2039
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
this first

2040
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
second

2041
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Third I used to be with some old personal friends

2042
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,560
have done experiments

2043
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:07,860
Which teachers you all probably know

2044
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:12,360
Like Yaxuan in Taipei now

2045
01:55:13,860 --> 01:55:20,260
And Luo Fu, Zhang Meng and this business situation

2046
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:23,360
Xinyi just passed away

2047
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:28,360
What kind of name, take care of these older teachers

2048
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:39,660
They once told the China Times that Mr. Jiang was happy to say that they wanted to innovate another song by the teacher.

2049
01:55:40,260 --> 01:55:42,060
Illustrator

2050
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:48,160
In the teacher, the image expresses a kind of teacher's realm

2051
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:50,860
I was against it

2052
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:55,660
I say the teacher is text and vocal music

2053
01:55:56,460 --> 01:56:00,160
This text means this feeling

2054
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,000
rather than plastic arts

2055
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
so what

2056
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
you use pictures

2057
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
I can't draw no matter what

2058
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
teacher this thing

2059
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I said your thoughts

2060
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
ignored

2061
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
It doesn't matter now

2062
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
emotional language melody

2063
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
it is very important

2064
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
if you don't believe it

2065
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
I organize our National Taiwan University Chinese Department

2066
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Some graduate students of the Institute of Chinese Studies

2067
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Come and sing for you

2068
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:38,000
So they waited a week

2069
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,000
The People's Exchange of China Times

2070
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
everyone creates

2071
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Anyway, I really don't know

2072
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
I read poetry is messed up

2073
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
various symbols

2074
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
All kinds of crooked writing

2075
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:55,000
This is one word for us

2076
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
self-reliant

2077
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
that line

2078
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Just let Wen Zheng win him

2079
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,000
And the really important thing is his response

2080
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,000
But practice

2081
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
if you pay attention to yourself

2082
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Sometimes it can be a literary technique

2083
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
For example, if I open, for example,

2084
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Manchao Xinjian

2085
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
this tide

2086
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Man Zhaoxin check it out

2087
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
If you write the test as below

2088
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
edge check

2089
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
It seems that Manchao is a bit stiff

2090
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,000
you are still on this bicycle

2091
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
see tips

2092
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
But this is rarely the case

2093
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,000
result new item this

2094
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,000
right there with them

2095
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
I took the students from National Taiwan University

2096
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Sing with Songying

2097
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
syllable belly step these

2098
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,000
these this this

2099
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Calculation

2100
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,000
other

2101
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,000
it's all about them

2102
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
no way today

2103
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,000
At the time of recovery, I gave two examples

2104
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Luo Fu had a heart attack on the tunnel

2105
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,000
My students took him to use him

2106
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:16,000
He uses the pull to use the negative, he uses the strength and weakness to rise and fall

2107
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Lafu sits next to me and grabs my hand

2108
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Is my roommate as nice as that?

2109
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:29,000
I said my student used his plea

2110
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:34,000
take advantage of your words

2111
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,000
strengthen the description

2112
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:41,000
So he looks more alive

2113
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:44,000
they use their voice

2114
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:49,000
I'm interpreting and appreciating your thoughts

2115
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:52,000
who we listen to

2116
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
just use our hearing to suck

2117
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Listening to their voices interpreting our thoughts

2118
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Learned from their mother that night

2119
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:06,000
Afraid of being sung, I cried

2120
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Am I thinking so well?

2121
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:09,000
the same reason

2122
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:13,000
so now the new poet

2123
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,000
very particular about this ancient poem

2124
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:20,000
also started to speak on this recitation

2125
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,000
right

2126
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
They all attach great importance to this recitation

2127
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,000
many poets would

2128
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
The realm of ancient poetry

2129
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
stands for turning it into a new poem

2130
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:34,000
and slowly know

2131
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,000
This mastery of the melody of language

2132
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:42,000
At present, the world of new poetry is like the ancients

2133
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000
or self-awareness

2134
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
The use of natural language melody

2135
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
not yet formed

2136
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
this like

2137
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
this

2138
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Transport literature to this one everyone

2139
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
there are eight

2140
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
B

2141
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
How many characters are fixed

2142
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:09,000
How many sentences, so since the number rate, drama number rate, length rate

2143
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:14,000
A few words form a sentence, and the position of the long and short words cannot be changed

2144
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:20,000
There is also a single and double rate in the sentence.

2145
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:24,000
And of course its basic rhyme

2146
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:28,000
what is this

2147
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Comments on my strength, raw power, raw power

2148
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:39,000
and the structural force of special and legal in sentences

2149
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
to such an extent

2150
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:45,000
This took one or two thousand years

2151
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
just finished

2152
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:51,000
If we count from the time when the scriptures were given, then for more than three thousand years

2153
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:59,000
So the only way for the mind to go as it is now is to be spectacled.

2154
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,920
but not within reach

2155
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:05,380
You see Cai Mingguo is more than a hundred and zero

2156
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:11,200
For the formation and maturity of a problem

2157
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:13,200
Mind is still in kindergarten

2158
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:16,280
still crawling on the ground

2159
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:17,500
maybe i'm exaggerating

2160
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:18,000
sorry

2161
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:21,620
good everyone

2162
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,000
good

2163
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Just now when the teacher read ten words for us

2164
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:40,000
For example, the point in the middle

2165
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
don't pronounce it sharp

2166
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
read it

2167
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
one hundred two hundred

2168
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
If you don't read a hundred, you can't read a hundred

2169
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
or

2170
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
specifically mentioned

2171
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
If you want to read it

2172
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
have a special idea

2173
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
But this generally tells me

2174
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Mandarin seems to be different

2175
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
What I want to ask is instead

2176
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Actually, I heard the teacher play today

2177
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
I'm very, very envious

2178
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
I wonder if there is a way for us to go

2179
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Change your Mandarin to say

2180
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
can be used with poetry

2181
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
this because

2182
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
this

2183
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Most of what we talked about today was about classical literature.

2184
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Tang poetry as you should use this

2185
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
medieval language

2186
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
In the language of the Middle Ages

2187
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,000
This entrance is very particular

2188
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
so when i was thinking

2189
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
special

2190
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
mark it out

2191
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,000
What's more, languages ​​change over time and space.

2192
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Vary with time and space

2193
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:40,000
So where the ancients rhymed

2194
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
The result of our strain now

2195
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
doesn't rhyme

2196
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
But the future will make him this

2197
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
voice is not good

2198
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
why put the tip

2199
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Because the tip is now the first rhyme

2200
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
sharp

2201
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
but dry is korean rhyme

2202
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,000
no the same

2203
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
just like i said

2204
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,000
at this time

2205
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Ah Jin listened to the words and gave birth to the following.

2206
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
you see this is not a good read

2207
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:15,000
But that one is rewarding life in the Tang Dynasty

2208
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,000
One word is dumb, say what I read is

2209
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Ah Jin listened to the words and gave birth to the following.

2210
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Does it sound better?

2211
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:29,000
In this case restore the archaic

2212
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Our national language was formed in the north

2213
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Now it's northern mandarin

2214
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:44,000
This is because of the mixing of ethnic groups from the Northern and Southern Dynasties

2215
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,000
So the so-called language, the result of fusion

2216
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
is getting easier

2217
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:55,000
So to be born is to be left

2218
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,000
level up, life, share nutrition

2219
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
so intense results

2220
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
basically alive

2221
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,000
right

2222
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
But our Minnan dialect

2223
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Usually go to the meat

2224
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Can also be divided into yin and yang

2225
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
There are eight raw tones

2226
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
positive and negative

2227
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Regardless

2228
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
So seven raw tones

2229
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Cantonese

2230
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
There are three tunes

2231
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
nine raw tunes

2232
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
So Cantonese

2233
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Du Tang poetry

2234
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Very beautiful

2235
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
because of his melody

2236
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
this change

2237
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,000
all broken

2238
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:40,000
why we heard the song

2239
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
often do not understand

2240
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Hear this song in Minnan

2241
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
just understand

2242
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
because we have eight tones

2243
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,000
eight tones

2244
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,000
so what about this

2245
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,000
all because

2246
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,000
A story that can change at any time

2247
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Should we just stop here and ask that Professor Shi to cut off that TOO from our southern Fujian?

2248
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Minnan Geyao This is a language right that comes from four mouths with one heart, a natural language right

2249
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:31,000
And his Hokkien-born relationship, there are changes in the length and length of the sentence in the pursuit

2250
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:43,000
At the same time, it can be said that it vividly writes a very interesting folk phenomenon.

2251
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Shouldn't our vice president just ask him to sing this song and we're done today, okay?

2252
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Because he already asked two questions, see the third question

2253
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,000
ok now please

2254
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,620
But every word

2255
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:04,640
Usually our folk songs are

2256
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:07,480
Language is like music

2257
02:06:07,480 --> 02:06:08,000
for example

2258
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,760
show palm

2259
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:11,840
Listening is a show

2260
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:13,480
show it

2261
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:15,840
This POO is the same

2262
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:17,800
language is music

2263
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:19,080
So our folk songs

2264
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:22,400
Language and music are combined

2265
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:25,720
And the teacher's theory shows that this gray and black day is

2266
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:27,480
word for word

2267
02:06:27,480 --> 02:06:29,040
according to his lyrics

2268
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:31,000
That's because this song is lighter

2269
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,120
So with the voice that I missed just now

2270
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:36,000
I will show differently

2271
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:36,320
listen

2272
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:37,560
oh oh

2273
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:39,160
to fall behind

2274
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:40,680
grandpa remember

2275
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:41,840
he wants

2276
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:42,480
good

2277
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:43,880
oh

2278
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:44,240
good

2279
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:45,480
la good

2280
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:45,880
good

2281
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:47,160
la good

2282
02:06:47,160 --> 02:06:47,880
good to

2283
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:50,400
step by step

2284
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:51,440
he wants

2285
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:56,200
until really escape

2286
02:06:56,200 --> 02:06:59,360
Grandpa wants to escape

2287
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Grandma wants to cook and grandpa wants to cook

2288
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Grandma wants to cook

2289
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Both bags are torn, both are torn, both are torn

2290
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:27,000
A night of multi-dragon action before starting, wahaha

2291
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Thanks

2292
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Brother Lin has a lot of crimes

2293
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
meaningless sound

2294
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
this meaningless sound

2295
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,000
We will strengthen this situation in the future

2296
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:46,000
So voice, emotion, and emotion must be closely linked.

2297
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,000
thank you

2298
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Today I am very grateful to Zeng Yuan and Professor Shi

2299
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:58,000
I think we passed and sang and listened

2300
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,360
took us all night

2301
02:08:02,360 --> 02:08:04,600
I hope everyone knows

2302
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:10,800
The Importance of Movement and Melody to Shi Zhi

2303
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:13,800
ok thanks again
