1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,940
aboard.

2
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:49,940
Welcome to the Institute of Science and Technology of the Central Institute of Science and Technology.

3
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,940
I am the director of the Institute of Science and Technology of the Central Institute of Science and Technology.

4
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,940
I am honored to be able to introduce today's host.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,680
Vice President Wang Jingxing of our Central Plains Institute

6
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,720
here?

7
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,000
because our guest

8
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,280
He is our new Secretary-General of the Central Plains Academy

9
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,600
Secretary Peng Jinkun Peng

10
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,320
OK, then I'll hand the mic over to today's host.

11
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,600
this

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,880
thanks for this our host

13
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,480
Director Chen

14
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,120
Thank you all so much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to listen to this

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,880
Share this Feast of Wisdom

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,480
That

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,120
Logically, I just want to introduce

18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,120
this our keynote speaker

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,800
what about the fact

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,840
our keynote speaker

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,160
For the people of National Taiwan University

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,680
no stranger

23
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,600
In fact, he has been

24
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,200
Our National Taiwan University

25
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,880
Serve hard

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,400
Poached by Central Researcher

27
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,880
is now the director of our Central Fellows Institute of Law

28
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,280
he was also a justice

29
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,080
So everyone is familiar with his name

30
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,720
Sometimes I have seen his name in the media magazines before

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,040
listened to his advice

32
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,680
then i am

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,120
Actually, he's an old friend to me personally.

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,080
Because he went to Harvard University in the United States for a year

35
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,760
this for research

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,200
we just met there

37
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,520
Then I still wish to compare some of his

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,560
objective study

39
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,040
After sharing this report with everyone

40
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,640
Of course he didn't have to say he was

41
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,480
Graduated from the Law Department of National Taiwan University

42
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,160
That also went to graduate school

43
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,200
Then he later in the United States

44
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,240
Connors University

45
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,600
Cornell University's Juris Doctor

46
00:02:59,600 --> 00:02:59,960
that he

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,260
It is now our Academia Sinica's Institute of Law

48
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,760
Distinguished Researcher and Director

49
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,880
So a Distinguished Researcher is equivalent to a University Chair Professor

50
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,140
But he is also from the law school of our National Taiwan University.

51
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,080
part-time professor

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,920
his long-standing commitment to the constitution

53
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,960
Freedom of Speech Privacy

54
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,840
Research in the Field of Information Law

55
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,800
Then this is like what I just said

56
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,400
He stayed in Taiwan University for a long time

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,880
He was from 1978 to 2003

58
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,120
He served as a teaching assistant in the law department of National Taiwan University

59
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,920
Lecturer Associate Professor Professor

60
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,800
2003 to 2011

61
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,520
chief justice of the judiciary

62
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,120
Well, this is generally what legal people envy the most in the future is to become a university student.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,560
The judge did this, and he did it.

64
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,920
Then he will talk about one today

65
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,240
very important topic

66
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,080
There are some special revelations for our reality

67
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,400
privacy in the information society

68
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,920
privacy

69
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,320
i remember i was in the 1980s

70
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,080
While studying at Harvard

71
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,720
There is a very famous professor at Harvard University

72
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,160
Called Daniel Bale

73
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,680
He learns a famous book

74
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,640
就是The Coming of the Poster Industrial Society

75
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,520
With the advent of the post-industrial society

76
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,320
Then think about thirty years ago

77
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,520
That computer is definitely something only the rich can afford.

78
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,480
They're all big, big computers.

79
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,400
But then you have to think about saying

80
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,280
invention of computer

81
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,800
will change the future of mankind

82
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,120
Organization Structure Even Behavior

83
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,480
But from thirty years later you see

84
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,920
Sure enough, you see that this has changed so much

85
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,000
like us now

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,700
It's hard for someone like me to understand

87
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,560
This world has become very strange to me

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,200
But we have this speech by Director Lin

89
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,560
we may know better

90
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,460
Especially when it comes to privacy, privacy, these things.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,160
I think everyone is very interested

92
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,460
then i won't talk nonsense

93
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,660
We now invite Director Lin to welcome Director Lin

94
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,660
Thanks

95
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,660
Thanks

96
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,660
Director Chen and thank you for Huang Feiyuan's introduction just now

97
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,660
Thank you ladies and gentlemen too

98
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,660
Participate in today's this I want to report to you

99
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,660
theme

100
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,660
actually, I

101
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,660
Let's look at these two pictures first

102
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,660
I actually probably won’t use this slide too much today

103
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,660
Probably the time when the powerpoint was used

104
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,660
mainly possible

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,240
no way to speak or say

106
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,160
or

107
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,260
Because some sharp legal texts will be used in it

108
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,540
Even if

109
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,600
It is not easy for everyone to understand what I say in this way

110
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,840
So it would be possible to use this

111
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,640
Orpoin, other than that, I'd probably

112
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,860
I really hope that I can talk to you in a relatively simple way.

113
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,400
let's talk

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,320
What I am going to talk to you about today in the information society

115
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,560
Privacy and Privacy

116
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,720
Let's take a look at these two pictures first

117
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,620
here is the first

118
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:42,960
sorry

119
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,000
this is the second

120
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,720
Let's take a closer look at these two

121
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,440
I ask everyone to take a look and try this place

122
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,200
If you look at this picture, this place

123
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,880
It's just that if only this room looks like it has only one door

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,460
For the other rooms, he is the same

125
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,640
look at another one

126
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,400
Take a closer look at this one

127
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,480
every room here every room here

128
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,100
If he has at least a few rooms, there's only one door.

129
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,600
What I want to tell you is that this is what if

130
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,040
This is a traditional building in Taiwan

131
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,360
What about these two architectural drawings?

132
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,960
For these two architectural drawings, he

133
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,440
Basically after the middle of the 19th century

134
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,120
A design that is probably quite common in Taiwan

135
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,680
If such a design is generally speaking

136
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,720
words probably

137
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,200
I don't know why they designed it that way

138
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,280
but

139
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,800
If I read more articles, it might be inside

140
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,600
and

141
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,200
Southern Fujian has something to do with Ke’s buildings

142
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,600
For example, what we just talked about is this

143
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,480
a building

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
In terms of architectural drawings, it may have something to do with Hakka

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It was more like

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
In this picture, he may be with

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The architectural map of southern Fujian may have something to do with it

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But I was just saying maybe I

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
My analysis is probably wrong

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
My analysis may be wrong, just because

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I because in order to talk about what is privacy

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
so i brought a tinted glasses

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Look at these two pictures with prejudice

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Then when I look at these two pictures, I feel a little happy

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Say look we can tell you a little bit

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Why? Because here we can see

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
In terms of the design of these two pictures, at least as living in this

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
People who live inside may feel differently

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If a room then this room

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There are many places to go in and out

161
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Not only like our current society

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
In most homes, if it is your own room

163
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
my room with my spouse

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If you are not married today

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
not yet married

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I live with my parents

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
children or children

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I also hope that everyone wants to have a separate room for themselves

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
what do you mean by separate room

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
A separate room is just one door

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And what about this door?

172
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
i can control

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
should i invite people in

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But you can imagine

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If you live in one room

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
many doors

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
what if i live in it

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
live in a place where i can control the door

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's different in this case

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
but i just said

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
i could be wrong

182
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I may be reading it wrong

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The reason my interpretation might be wrong is because

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I look at something like this with colored eyes

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But suppose I'm wrong

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
it doesn't matter

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Actually, I want to tell you this from the very beginning.

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
like this

189
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
if

190
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
if we think

191
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What about his privacy?

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
we will proceed

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,640
Basic understanding, what about privacy?

194
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,140
Is a minimum if in terms of space design

195
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,540
If there should be a space that I can control

196
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,940
What do these two pictures represent?

197
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,840
maybe not the same

198
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,840
But I also have to tell you

199
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,440
it doesn't mean to say

200
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,040
designed like this

201
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,740
It has no concept of privacy

202
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,940
maybe it's just something

203
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,840
we all have because my thoughts are

204
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,040
based on each society

205
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,440
Every society has a concept of privacy

206
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,940
that's just saying

207
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,240
What about in a different society or in the same society?

208
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,040
In different times

209
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,840
content that may be private

210
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,240
may not be the same

211
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,440
That's why we said, in fact, everyone, I just talked about it at the beginning

212
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,440
Design drawings of the two rooms

213
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,740
In fact, it was probably after the middle of the 19th century.

214
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,040
The general architecture in Taiwan looks like this

215
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
what does that mean

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
means that at the same time we exist

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This kind of house with two designs

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
that doesn't mean

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Only their words have privacy

220
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
there is no privacy

221
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
not like this

222
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
but what

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
maybe they are different

224
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
For private content

225
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
may think differently

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Guys, think again

227
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That just talked to the vice president

228
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
just chatting

229
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We had a conversation with the vice president this year

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
go to italy

231
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
When we got to Italy we went to Florins

232
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The one from Florins

233
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
what i forgot was that it belonged to the lord

234
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
He later became a museum

235
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
if we go to that museum

236
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
you can see that museum

237
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Then just keep thinking about that space

238
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He is from this room to another room

239
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
can pass

240
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Think about it again everyone

241
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
been to france

242
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Germany, Austria

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What about these European countries?

244
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If we go to that kind of palace

245
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
or the lord kind

246
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
When visiting the building

247
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
He is now open

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
sometimes it has become a museum

249
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Let's think about the space design

250
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't know about the space design

251
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Just right for our visit now, right?

252
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
from this room to another room

253
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
No need to go out again to the hallway

254
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
then walk down the corridor

255
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
use a room

256
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No, but every room is accessible

257
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
what does this mean

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So this is very interesting

259
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
at the same time

260
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
that may have been at that time

261
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
maybe in continental europe

262
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
their words at the same time

263
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It may be for the nobles or the royal family

264
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I think they are very modern

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
A design of Fashion

266
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
they don't necessarily think

267
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
they may not think that means

268
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I must have a separate room for each

269
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It means privacy

270
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
probably not the idea

271
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
so i just said

272
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm from a biased perspective

273
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
look at something like this

274
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
this kind of thing

275
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I also wanted to tell you

276
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Don't just say that

277
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
they have no privacy

278
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
not privacy

279
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,240
Just look at it with a hard eye

280
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,000
maybe they are in this place

281
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,200
maybe from my point of view

282
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,040
They didn't protect the privacy of the person who lived in the room

283
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,440
But maybe he has more privacy elsewhere than we do.

284
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,160
so what

285
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,040
What about in different societies?

286
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,960
Although every society has its own concept of privacy

287
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,040
But what about his private content?

288
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,360
may not be the same

289
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,960
What if I use this example

290
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,600
Let me tell you about tomorrow

291
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,880
Actually, I am not talking about architecture with outsiders today.

292
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,760
Maybe when it comes to architecture, everyone here may be more suitable to talk about than me.

293
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,400
Then I just want to understand with you

294
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,240
What I mean to explain to you is this

295
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,920
Such a study of privacy

296
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,800
In fact, it's not just limited to my Chinese law.

297
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,160
In fact, everyone in society should care about him

298
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,640
His appearance because of privacy

299
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,040
We're going to learn about a society at a time

300
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,520
when was his privacy view

301
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,040
Actually we

302
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
There may be a lot to see

303
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Not just the so-called counting system at that time

304
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
what does his law say

305
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
or his organizational design

306
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Probably more important to look at his life

307
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
How do they live in normal daily life?

308
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
See them from the midst of his daily life

309
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
what they care what they don't care

310
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Then we can understand

311
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
In terms of that society, what they presented at that time

312
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Where did they put the connotation of privacy?

313
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
so i basically

314
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Although today I want to talk to you about privacy and privacy

315
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But I really wanted to tell you from the beginning

316
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
In fact, what I want to talk about today is limited.

317
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm just speaking from my lawyer's point of view

318
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
In fact, there may be more that can be cut into the surface

319
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Then this study

320
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Because I have been engaged in this research for quite a long time

321
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Then this kind of research

322
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Of course, domestic research is relatively

323
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
not very hot and weak

324
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Then if you read some foreign research

325
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You can see that foreign research is very

326
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,640
He has a very broad entry point

327
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,240
That makes me very envious

328
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,440
They can come from many places like we just talked about

329
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,040
It's a building they might talk about life

330
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,040
He looks at it from different places

331
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,880
their society or a certain society

332
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,480
what is that privacy concept

333
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,760
But if you go back to Taiwan and look at our own research in Taiwan

334
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,760
What about these parts? Relatively speaking, it is relatively

335
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,680
Few people do research in this area

336
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,720
So I also hope to say what I said in today's speech.

337
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,720
able to evoke what you are doing

338
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,760
interested in this thing

339
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,320
And then we can look at it from a different perspective, a different perspective

340
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,320
or from different scholars

341
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,800
It can be cut into the research that is done, if this is the case

342
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,520
we're going to talk about privacy on this

343
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,400
His content will be richer

344
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,640
Then I will do a little bit of my personal research today.

345
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,640
A cut-in from my personal research

346
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,000
Then go further into some of the results of my research so far

347
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,640
I will give you a little report

348
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,040
let's talk

349
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
From a lawyer's point of view From my personal point of view as a lawyer

350
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
When we are doing other legal people

351
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Not everyone has a different opinion

352
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm just speaking from my personal point of view

353
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Let me explain to you

354
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
what is privacy what is privacy

355
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
then what happened to it now

356
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Now it's the consulting society

357
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
what happened in the middle of the consulting society

358
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What about these things? From the legal person's point of view

359
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
From my point of view as a lawyer

360
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Why do you think the current law

361
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
the current rule of law on privacy

362
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
There are deficiencies in the legal norms

363
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
then what we say about such things

364
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
how should

365
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
how to look at such a thing

366
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's probably what I'm going to talk to you about today.

367
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
wait a minute

368
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
Talk to us about privacy first

369
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,100
That

370
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,200
I'm offering you a

371
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,900
one

372
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,200
you may not have noticed

373
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,200
Everyone, let's talk about privacy first.

374
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,500
everyone talks about privacy

375
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,600
if talking about privacy

376
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
you can think of

377
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,600
privacy

378
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,000
May be Privacy

379
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,200
Outside Privacy

380
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,000
or Privacy

381
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,500
or a different way of thinking

382
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
But it's Privacy

383
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,900
That

384
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,400
why does it make me feel like saying

385
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,200
This Privacy translates into privacy

386
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,800
Or privacy is to do Privacy

387
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
has a problem

388
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,400
because if i

389
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,300
If all of us can understand

390
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,800
It means our Jingling

391
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,500
statue japan

392
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,800
or Korea

393
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,600
same with

394
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,400
Words in the middle of traditional culture, society and culture

395
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,100
is subject to

396
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
probably influenced by our culture

397
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,700
The source is about the same

398
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,300
But the words of their society are strange

399
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,700
When they also encounter Privacy

400
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
They didn't translate it into an equivalent word in Japanese

401
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Korean is the same no

402
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
relatively speaking

403
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
They used the so-called foreign language

404
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What about his words in his pinyin?

405
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Go and translate that Privacy into

406
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
spelled his Japanese

407
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
or in Korean

408
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
relatively strange

409
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Then why do we translate Privacy into privacy in Taiwan?

410
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Hong Kong turned it into private printing

411
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What about mainland China and Macau?

412
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
all turned into privacy

413
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
it's weird

414
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
In the Chinese world

415
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
we will say categorically

416
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
we just have

417
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
In the middle of Chinese, there are words that can

418
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
To show that it is equivalent to this Privacy

419
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
same

420
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
in Japan or in Korea

421
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
why didn't they do something like this

422
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
why is it like this

423
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Are we starting to touch

424
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
When the word Privacy

425
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
When we are going to translate it into Chinese

426
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
China at that time

427
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Chinese

428
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What about in our Chinese world?

429
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
In fact, there are corresponding words

430
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It corresponds to this Privacy

431
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So we apply it

432
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
is it so

433
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
This is what caused me to

434
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
why this

435
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
one reason to study him

436
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Of course through this

437
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
we can go up slowly

438
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I was talking just now

439
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
because every society

440
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
He has a concept of privacy

441
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So by saying like this

442
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
In fact, if we understand that

443
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
This Privacy is equal to privacy

444
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Then we also want to pass

445
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What about the word privacy?

446
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
to see in our traditional society

447
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
so far

448
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What is our view on privacy

449
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What is our view on this privacy

450
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I also want to

451
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
in this regard

452
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
also want to do a little research

453
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
But first I can tell you some conclusions

454
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
because the process is not over yet

455
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Because the process is quite long

456
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,600
There is a way to talk to you like this, if you talk like this, everyone may not be interested

457
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,520
but

458
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,060
From the middle of this kind of research, I just talked about this

459
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,500
Especially when I saw the words of the vice president here, I said

460
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,040
I am from a lawyer's point of view

461
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,840
I'm not from a historian's point of view so the middle of the report

462
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,800
If you think history is not interpreted this way, please tell me too

463
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,920
Then this will involve, in fact, there are also linguistic issues in it.

464
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,600
In addition to the historical linguistics just mentioned, if we

465
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,560
If it is expanded a bit, sociology and anthropology may both be required.

466
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,200
This should be fine

467
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,280
should be able to contribute or should be able to happen

468
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,480
I'll start with the conclusion

469
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,040
We believe

470
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,000
We came into contact with the word Privacy at that time

471
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,400
then turn it into privacy

472
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,040
Because of

473
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,400
The words of our society at that time were considered to be said

474
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,680
The word "privacy" in the Chinese world

475
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,440
It is corresponding to the Privacy in English

476
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I never said it was wrong before

477
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
In fact, when I first came into contact with

478
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What about Privacy?

479
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I so far some of our

480
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I have done some analysis so far

481
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Did not immediately translate him into privacy

482
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
no that's surprising

483
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
This lasted until after the 1970s

484
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
we're just getting started

485
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Really start to think that privacy can be privacy

486
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Privacy equals Privacy

487
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
This process is quite a long time

488
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
does not mean that the middle

489
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
No one treats Privacy as privacy

490
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
not like this

491
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It means that he will become

492
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
when there is no problem

493
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Probably after the 1970s

494
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
at least in taiwan

495
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So in order to think about this

496
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
we also did one thing

497
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
let him go

498
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
because to find

499
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
just find the earliest

500
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
to see if anyone found

501
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The earliest Yin-Han dictionary

502
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
then we have to do this

503
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Just look at the English-Chinese dictionary at that time.

504
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What does he mean by Privacy in Chinese?

505
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What about at the same time?

506
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
we also want to know

507
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Privacy at that time was in the English-speaking world

508
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
words of the english world

509
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What do they mean by Privacy

510
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
that of course some current words

511
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
what is done is still limited

512
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
We used Oxford

513
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
His English in Oxford

514
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That Dishonernary

515
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
what about looking for

516
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
We can see that at least in 1900

517
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
then we can see

518
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
they go back to words

519
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
An Oxford like this

520
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
English in Oxford

521
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Words in Dishonernary

522
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
When he said the word Privacy

523
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
He will say that it is actually from earlier

524
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Thanks

525
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,500
that's what they say

526
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,400
In fact, what about the word Privacy?

527
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,800
from

528
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,860
In the middle of the English-speaking world, it was between 191600 and 1700

529
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,400
You can probably see that a lot of texts use the word Privacy

530
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,200
That includes Sasbija's work

531
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,240
Also use it like this later

532
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,080
he used the word

533
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,080
Then by 1919, at least after 1700, after 1700

534
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,920
What about this part? Maybe

535
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,040
Use the word Privacy in the English world

536
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,040
just more and more more and more

537
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,080
So we still don't know when the word "he" first started.

538
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,880
But at least in 1600 there has been

539
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
What about after 1700?

540
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,280
he used the word

541
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,280
Then he used the word

542
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,280
Then he used the word but said it already existed in 1600

543
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
What about after 1700?

544
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,280
This word is probably very common in the English-speaking world.

545
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,280
That

546
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
What does the word Privacy mean?

547
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
According to this Ostford University some of their

548
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Induction, he thinks he has about six meanings

549
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
But by 1900 they were saying

550
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
In fact, these six meanings

551
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
If from their analysis

552
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I think it refers to the words from 1700 to the present

553
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
By then 1900 words

554
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Probably two meanings

555
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
There are probably only two meanings left

556
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Other words probably have become

557
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
yes

558
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
passed

559
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
or no longer commonly used

560
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Those two meanings are commonly used

561
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
That is to say, it may be a kind of solitary

562
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
The state or condition of being out of public notice

563
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
is a right to choose

564
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
That's a kind of rejection

565
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
or freedom from interference or intrusion

566
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
this is the first explanation

567
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
the second explanation

568
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
is to say

569
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Private or Personal Matters of the First Kind

570
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
is a secret

571
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
you can understand

572
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What about after that?

573
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Probably everyone

574
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It may be the word privacy that you first imagined.

575
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
In the middle of your mind now

576
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Does it mean this kind of privacy?

577
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
think about it

578
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
each of us mouth

579
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Now everyone will talk about

580
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
This is my privacy

581
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
This is my privacy

582
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
when we say this

583
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
what we think is my privacy

584
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
what is that privacy

585
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
This is not usually according to this Chinese wording

586
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
just in Chinese

587
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
don't be so stupid

588
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Why do you spend so much time doing research?

589
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Just follow the literal meaning of Chinese

590
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It's something I don't want others to know

591
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
is it like this

592
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
In fact, of course, what else is there on the other hand?

593
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Just now if you see what you just said

594
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Ospo's his

595
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
words in english language

596
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
what he said

597
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
he's not just talking about that

598
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
he also includes space

599
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm a space I don't want people to invade

600
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Everyone think about the building just mentioned

601
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
that house house

602
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The design of that room of the house

603
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
the design of that room

604
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Do you feel

605
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,600
That kind of fits with my notion of privacy

606
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,000
That said, my view of privacy

607
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Not just saying a lot of things I don't want people to know

608
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,600
May also include I must have a space

609
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,000
to allow anyone to enter the space

610
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
unless invited

611
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So this may be what you want to see

612
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,400
After the 1970s

613
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,200
Until now, Privacy in English

614
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,400
what about this word

615
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,400
Is what he explained already a bit like this?

616
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,400
But it's also quite strange

617
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
What about in the Chinese world?

618
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
what we saw

619
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
what we found was looking for that

620
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Just now I reported to you

621
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Let's go find a Yin-Han dictionary

622
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
But when looking for a Yin-Han dictionary?

623
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,400
The Yin-Han dictionary does not directly translate Privacy into

624
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,400
Privacy that everyone takes for granted now is not

625
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,400
The most common one is to turn Privacy into

626
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
wet

627
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
we'll keep him private

628
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Then it becomes very

629
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Very very strange

630
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
or interesting

631
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Then I'm cutting in from another angle

632
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So that you can be more clear what I just said is that

633
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
In fact, we now think

634
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Privacy is privacy

635
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
We just flip it over like this

636
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
that's not that fast

637
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
A message I got from another legal person

638
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The information provided just now may not be enough

639
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
because if anyone is interested

640
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
If today is linguistics

641
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
or literary

642
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
if interested

643
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
with more research

644
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
may find out

645
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
This information is not enough

646
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Or even the interpretation of this information is wrong

647
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
that's okay

648
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I am now offering a view from a legal person

649
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
What do we think of the legal person?

650
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
We learn from our legal textbooks

651
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Let's look at the journal papers

652
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
let's see what it means

653
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
If Privacy is called

654
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
From the photographer's words, it stands to reason

655
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
If in our legal person's

656
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
inside this textbook

657
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
or in the research we wrote about

658
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
What about the words in the middle of the paper?

659
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
when he uses the word

660
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
He should be a single shadow teacher right away, right?

661
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
What does it look like?

662
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
just what i told you

663
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Why talk about the 1970s

664
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
probably later

665
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
it may be possible to say

666
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It wasn't like this before

667
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Because

668
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
because we lawyers

669
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
These textbooks published

670
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
or drill some

671
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
What about the words among the published papers in these odd journals?

672
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
messages we found

673
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
can see

674
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
not like this

675
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
it's going to be slow

676
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
glasses to the end words

677
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
what did it become

678
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
become a photographer

679
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
the early days

680
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
earliest

681
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
we can see that means

682
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
if that he wrote that

683
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
odd journal paper

684
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
or he is in the book

685
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
he us

686
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
The reason why we can know is to say

687
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
In fact, I want to talk about Private

688
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
the word

689
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The reason is because we start with

690
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,200
Let's now look at the materials he used at that time

691
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,360
information in english

692
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,000
We can tell he wants to use the word Privacy

693
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,560
But then

694
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,760
first translated words

695
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,720
He didn't translate him as Privacy

696
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,920
turned into privacy

697
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,320
he turned him into a secret

698
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,360
turned into a secret

699
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,800
that turned into a secret

700
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,560
Then later words gradually slowly changed from secret

701
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,360
just started to become private

702
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,360
this is very interesting

703
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,400
why is it funny

704
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,720
If we start from another entry point

705
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,920
We do not start from the word Privacy

706
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,280
but from

707
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,600
everyone knows

708
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,480
this

709
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,880
Maybe you are not so clear

710
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,880
but i can tell you

711
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,960
Taiwan's Civil and Criminal Law

712
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,640
Basically

713
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,320
Everyone says we are a civil law system

714
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,960
Many of you can understand

715
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,840
civil law

716
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,680
We are not a legal system

717
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,680
civil law

718
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,400
Under the context of the civil law system,

719
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,760
our in

720
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
It's in the civil law

721
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,760
is also subject to

722
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
Logically speaking, it is also a civil law system

723
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,500
The legal system is based on this tradition

724
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,500
As for the civil law system, there probably is one

725
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,260
probably related to the privacy we're going to talk about today

726
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,020
right of personality

727
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,740
personality rights section or torts section

728
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,060
Then we go to the early

729
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Textbook of Civil Law

730
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,420
As for the civil law textbooks, at the earliest time, of course we

731
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,140
Just find Mr. Shi Changhuan, and then become a possible legal person

732
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,220
Mr. Shi Changhuan

733
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,540
That Mr. Shi Changhuan first used

734
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,820
in his textbook

735
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,580
What about the words in his textbook? He is using

736
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,160
In the

737
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,580
In fact, he wants to explain what personality rights are

738
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,780
or infringement

739
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,860
The part that infringes on personality rights

740
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,220
As a result, two words suddenly appeared in him.

741
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:47,900
is a secret

742
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:48,980
secret

743
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,220
He just said something in the middle of this type of human rights violation

744
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,620
there are secrets in it

745
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,060
The word secret is actually the same as

746
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,780
if we say this

747
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,760
It's actually the same as the privacy we're going to talk about today.

748
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,760
But they're called secrets

749
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,340
So on the other hand

750
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,340
We can see another tradition

751
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,840
That is the tradition of the civil law system

752
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,960
traditional words in civil law systems

753
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,960
speaks this part of german

754
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,340
words in this part of germany

755
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,160
I have to tell you here too

756
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,960
Today we talk about privacy called Privacy

757
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,160
Privacy is privacy

758
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,000
But when we say

759
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's Privacy under the English-speaking world

760
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Let me tell you a little bit more

761
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
In fact, the word Privacy

762
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,500
in german or in french

763
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,000
At least the one I asked didn't have the same word

764
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
no same word

765
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Of course they express it in other ways

766
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
same concept

767
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
so today we

768
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Strange

769
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I mean Taiwan

770
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Mainland China

771
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Hong Kong

772
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Macau

773
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
South Korea

774
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
south korea

775
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Or use Privacy in Japan

776
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Privacy is used in many places

777
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
then directly

778
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,700
adopted the traditions directly from here

779
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,800
Traditions on the side of Anglo-American law

780
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,900
The traditional words of German law become another

781
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,400
But here the words are in this

782
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,400
The words on this, this, this topic, on this topic

783
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,200
The last thing we saw was a stream

784
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,100
Meeting stream becomes a privacy again

785
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,100
So let's look at what we just talked about

786
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,800
from if from this civil law system

787
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,700
If German law comes here

788
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,900
it's a secret

789
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
What about the last word?

790
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,600
Slowly it turns into privacy

791
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,000
over here

792
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,400
we just started talking about

793
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,840
We see that originally it was meant to say

794
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,200
The relevant information of the word Privacy

795
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,300
The words about these things come from Anglo-American law.

796
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,900
What about here?

797
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,300
In fact, Anglo-American law may be too broad

798
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,900
It should be about American law.

799
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,200
What about over here?

800
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,800
Privacy was originally translated as secret

801
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,700
why it turned into a secret

802
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,200
Is it because when the time was 1950

803
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,900
In the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s

804
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,800
In fact, in our legal circle

805
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,520
So in terms of that related concept, I think he is going to

806
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:03,960
secret

807
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,560
But then slowly it became private

808
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,480
It's a fun place to say I can't help it

809
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,400
find more

810
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,760
Let me explain with more information

811
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,960
Why was it 1960s and 70s, especially that

812
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,480
Why did that transformation in the 1970s start to become

813
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,360
used to tell secrets

814
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,080
So why now suddenly we need to use another

815
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,960
The word called privacy to replace the secret?

816
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,160
not sure

817
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,240
However, if the media

818
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,280
It's what journalism scholars and communication scholars talk about

819
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,040
They feel that the credit is on their side and cannot be credited.

820
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,120
That is to say, I will watch it at that time

821
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,720
That was the time when newspapers and magazines, they started more

822
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,840
reporting some

823
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,240
foreign news, foreign news inside

824
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,440
Perhaps the most reported ones are probably the news from the United States.

825
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,000
There may be more words in the news, just like now

826
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,680
At present, it may be that some societies

827
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,760
or some

828
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,400
Some news about some famous people and politicians

829
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,140
If it involves news about politicians and famous people

830
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,180
What must everyone want to see more?

831
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,940
It may be related to his Privacy

832
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,240
If he got it over here

833
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,340
Maybe they just turned it into Privacy

834
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,340
maybe it means

835
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,540
The word Privacy is translated into secret words

836
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,840
Maybe they got it over there

837
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,300
they don't think it's enough

838
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,700
not enough

839
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,640
when you're just telling a secret

840
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,200
They will feel that telling the secret should be an understanding

841
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,240
like this

842
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,500
But what about privacy?

843
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,840
Maybe his scope is a little bit more than secret

844
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,880
we are not sure

845
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,180
so let's go back and see

846
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,500
In fact, the word privacy

847
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,780
words in the chinese world

848
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,080
What about in our traditional culture?

849
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,380
Is there any way we can find these two words

850
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,180
what does he mean

851
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,740
Then we can see that the earliest words

852
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,800
The two words "hidden" and "lost" were separated very early

853
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
Appeared very early in the Chinese world

854
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,560
But what if these two words are connected together?

855
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,580
exist

856
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,660
It was mentioned in the Spring and Autumn Period of the Warring States Period

857
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,220
But it's funny when he mentions it. He's called

858
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,520
the winner wins or loses

859
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,320
win or lose

860
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,640
What does it mean? What is winning means losing?

861
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,740
That's the two words? He seems to agree.

862
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,520
agree

863
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,860
But he changed these two words into saying win or lose

864
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,140
he called win

865
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,160
lost too

866
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,960
So he is using

867
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,740
to explain what

868
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,800
What is winning and losing?

869
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:34,820
just win

870
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,600
That

871
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,400
If we go to the instructions to explain

872
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,500
When it comes to the explanation and explanation, let’s look at the explanation and explanation of Xu Sheng in the Eastern Han Dynasty

873
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,620
He came down from the front and down to him, at least up to the word he understood until then

874
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,720
He also didn't combine winning with losing half

875
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,780
At most, he just talked about winning and losing.

876
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,560
what is he talking about at most? what is he talking about at most?

877
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
In fact, what are the words called?

878
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
just cover one up

879
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's called shadow

880
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
But apart from this more usual awareness

881
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
In addition, there are about thirty other consciousnesses.

882
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
shadow meaning

883
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
However, the consciousness that has the most wishes for shadow names and names is shadows.

884
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
private eye

885
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Then this has been like this since the Warring States Period

886
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
If you really want to connect these two words together

887
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
The information we have found so far

888
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I can only see that it was in the Northern and Southern Dynasties

889
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
during the two dynasties

890
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
a word we see

891
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Should it be about the father or the word

892
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
a word is used in it

893
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
The two words called "shadow private" are connected together

894
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
But at that time

895
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Let's look at the time when the two words are connected together

896
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
what is its consciousness

897
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Consciousness is talking about husband and wife

898
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
something in the middle of defense

899
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Call shadow private

900
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
other than this

901
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
If we do some more analysis

902
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
we can probably see

903
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
except us

904
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,700
just talked about this

905
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,600
this

906
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,440
that is, between husband and wife

907
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,600
These situations between men and women

908
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,960
called privacy

909
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,960
Then there are probably two more, and three others. There are four in total.

910
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,600
We all seem more common

911
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,120
If we count

912
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,480
at least to

913
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,600
Late Qing Dynasty 190 19

914
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,520
It is equal to the mid-19th century in the late Qing Dynasty

915
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,600
Let's see what's going on in the middle, except what I just said

916
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,720
there is another

917
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,320
dark secret

918
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,640
My secret is also called privacy

919
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,360
The third kind of words, he does not have any positive

920
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,360
or the secret of negative reviews

921
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,640
secret

922
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,320
As for the fourth type, there are actually more of them.

923
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,720
as long as it raises something that might be worth discussing

924
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,200
He is a clean person, we often talk about it when we see it

925
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,800
Clean privacy Clean privacy

926
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,400
But when we watch him clean his privacy, we pay attention

927
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,640
at that time

928
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,960
What words do you use?

929
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,300
Its privacy is related to privacy

930
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,800
cloudy cloudy

931
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,600
Yin and private two are used at the same time

932
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,700
So this privacy and privacy

933
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,700
Everyone thinks of what privacy and privacy mean to you

934
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,900
what's your impression

935
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Is insidiousness more negative?

936
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,400
privacy seems like

937
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,800
It seems nothing special

938
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,500
But tell me

939
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,000
until at least

940
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,800
When we come into contact with the word Privacy

941
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,500
There's nothing wrong with having privacy back then

942
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,800
also have privacy

943
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,100
And privacy and privacy are used together

944
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,000
Then we can also see

945
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,600
If it will continue to develop at the end of the Qing Dynasty

946
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,800
to the Republic of China

947
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,100
Also these two words are also in our newspaper

948
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,800
or even on paperwork

949
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,300
I have seen the word privacy

950
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,800
So we can understand that by saying

951
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,800
When the word Privacy was introduced

952
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,000
Actually at that time

953
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,700
And we have no privacy for these two Chinese words

954
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,900
the word of these two words

955
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Existed at that time, not non-existent

956
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,120
So it's also strange that he didn't

957
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,320
PrivacyTranslate to this

958
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,320
When speaking Chinese, he did not choose

959
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,800
privacy that already existed

960
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,320
So it's also an interesting one

961
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,600
why is it like this

962
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,000
It is also worth our continued thinking

963
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,000
But what I wanted to tell you just now is to say

964
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,200
whether he is

965
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
even then

966
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,320
Or that I just researched

967
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
is wrong

968
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,320
Anyway, Privacy turned over is privacy

969
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,120
This privacy word is literally

970
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
I just don't want others to know

971
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,960
private matter

972
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,200
plus a little personal space

973
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,520
Then this word is the same as the word Privacy in English at that time

974
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,760
Even now the word is actually the same

975
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,720
Even though I just said that even if we have the same

976
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,720
concept

977
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
In fact, if you look at the wisdom of Chinese

978
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
over there privacy or privacy

979
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
or secret or something

980
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
In fact, we all have the concept of privacy

981
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It's just that we may not be useful

982
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Privacy as everyone understands it now

983
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
that subfield also describes it

984
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Then we might have to explain to you

985
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Even if we use the same words now

986
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
called privacy

987
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
But you have to understand

988
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
even with the same word

989
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
its at different times

990
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
or in different societies

991
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
The reason why it advocates the concept of privacy

992
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Its possible function and purpose

993
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
may not be exactly the same

994
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
so our

995
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Huang Kewu who entered the teacher's institute

996
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Director Huang once did some research

997
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I think he's a study

998
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
In the end he said something that said

999
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Actually even though we have the same noun

1000
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
but

1001
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
content of the concept

1002
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Especially from its function and purpose

1003
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
if it goes in

1004
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
We can see that it is actually different

1005
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Especially when it comes to privacy

1006
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
our privacy

1007
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Maybe it's just saying that I don't want others to know

1008
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I don't want people in my space

1009
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
But if we can learn

1010
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Said that we will go to see this matter again today

1011
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
You may not simply say

1012
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I don't want others to know

1013
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I don't want anyone to know come in

1014
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And maybe when we say these words

1015
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
In fact, there is another meaning

1016
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
that is the modern sense

1017
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It's just that there may be some individualistic concepts coming in.

1018
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
that early words

1019
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Maybe it doesn't have that idea

1020
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
The idea that it changes is over there

1021
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
it simply says

1022
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I don't want others to know

1023
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
But is there a behind it

1024
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
modern sense

1025
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
The reason why I don't want others to know

1026
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
don't want to make others angry

1027
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,300
In fact, he has a very positive meaning

1028
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,100
That positive means

1029
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,140
this is what i want to prove

1030
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,940
i am an autonomous

1031
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,240
self-determining

1032
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,040
i can be the one who chooses

1033
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,100
In this case maybe

1034
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,660
That meaning may not have been in the early days

1035
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,220
I don't know if you guys are thinking about privacy right now

1036
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,760
this is my privacy time

1037
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,560
When you say this word

1038
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,400
Apart from saying that this is the standby of the warm knife

1039
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,700
this is mine

1040
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,280
This is my space, you don't come in, you don't care about these things

1041
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,580
It's a matter of asking people to take care of it or not

1042
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,120
other than this

1043
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,940
do you have another meaning

1044
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:43,020
This is my business

1045
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,820
After this, I will be able to prove that

1046
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:50,940
I am an individual that exists alone and meaningfully

1047
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,260
Does it mean something like this

1048
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,840
If I want to talk to you today about the concept of privacy, I want to tell you

1049
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,400
In this way, I mainly want to tell you what I mean.

1050
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,960
Actually we are talking about privacy today

1051
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,000
Privacy may be related to this Privacy

1052
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,360
the original English word

1053
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,800
the word in the world

1054
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,160
modern meaning

1055
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,560
about the same

1056
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,200
So Chinese choose to use privacy

1057
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,660
Seems to be pretty good

1058
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,700
it also satisfies

1059
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,660
Literally interpreted from simplicity, it is very similar

1060
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,600
it's my private matter

1061
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,460
My personal affairs don't need your intervention

1062
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,320
Then let's add a little space concept into it.

1063
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,920
besides things

1064
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,820
what else is there room

1065
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,020
my space

1066
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,480
the size of this space

1067
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,860
maybe it's because

1068
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,880
The Contest I was in

1069
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,060
when the environment was different

1070
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,920
that maybe the size of that space

1071
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,080
may be a little different

1072
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,280
everyone can understand

1073
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,680
If it is here today, it is very urgent on the MRT

1074
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,180
Of course there is no way to talk about that space

1075
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,160
don't get too close to me

1076
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,180
if you get too close

1077
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,520
Just invade my privacy, probably not

1078
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,380
But if it's a very large space

1079
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,180
of course of course

1080
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,400
What are you doing so close to your official document?

1081
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,600
Why are the official documents so intimate?

1082
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,600
You'll feel like there's a difference between

1083
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,600
He said he was a relative concept

1084
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,900
But the words here are worth thinking about again.

1085
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,900
It is very worthwhile for us to think about a question that is

1086
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:19,400
Why does every society have some concept of so-called privacy

1087
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,600
The content of this privacy may not be complete

1088
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,200
very specific may not be exactly the same

1089
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,800
For example, often

1090
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,400
We often meet some new friends

1091
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,400
will always want to say

1092
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,600
I'm curious

1093
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,000
how do you stay so young

1094
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,400
you're probably only 18

1095
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,800
start asking people's age

1096
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,000
Wow you look like you are very accomplished

1097
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,400
how much money do you make every month

1098
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,500
Then this may be in some societies

1099
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,600
He doesn't think it's offensive

1100
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,900
But in some societies

1101
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,900
I thought how could it be like this

1102
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,000
it's none of your business

1103
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,400
so the details

1104
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,400
Just do what you don't want others to know

1105
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,400
we think it's reasonable

1106
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,320
What things in that society feel to say

1107
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,120
it's no big deal

1108
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,140
so you'll notice

1109
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,680
What about the very details?

1110
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,720
maybe it will be different

1111
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,040
So this also aroused my curiosity to say

1112
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,340
How could it be like this?

1113
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,160
Then let's think about another question slowly.

1114
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,440
That

1115
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,760
Time is limited, I can simply use one word

1116
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,300
One sentence in the middle of Lun

1117
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,320
it just talks

1118
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,880
non-gift event

1119
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,980
Non-gift story, non-gift is non-gift

1120
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,040
I can't sort it out like this

1121
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,100
maybe our

1122
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,660
Modern fathers and sons who are afraid of old people can be excreted

1123
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,700
what should be a gift

1124
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,060
Audio-visual serious audio-visual serious OK great

1125
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:48,140
Probably everyone can know this, if you are in

1126
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,200
In the western world, it can be seen as a water monkey

1127
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,760
Right or wrong?

1128
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,040
Mouth arms covered

1129
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,600
Actually I think it's a good example

1130
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
This is in the middle of the Analects

1131
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Empty words are not a thing he has said come out

1132
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It means that people may be in the middle of interaction

1133
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
He has at least one minimum thing

1134
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
His so-called unreasonable is not telling us not to see and not to listen

1135
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It's a matter of reason

1136
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Does it make sense?

1137
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
That reason may be that society

1138
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Or the middle of his ideal society?

1139
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
what is

1140
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Everyone should give respect to others

1141
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
there is a divide over there

1142
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So we're going to continue our research

1143
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
you will talk

1144
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
What about every society?

1145
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
What about the formation of his concept of privacy?

1146
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Will follow the so-called social norms of the society at that time

1147
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
English is called social norms

1148
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Then we translate it into words

1149
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
may be related to the social norms of the time

1150
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
may be related

1151
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Maybe it has something to do with some morals in a society

1152
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
some notions of value

1153
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
may be related

1154
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
what about these words

1155
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It may also be due to some time

1156
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
this

1157
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
What about different or social changes?

1158
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
he may have something different

1159
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,600
So we might as well understand this

1160
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,900
When we want to understand our society

1161
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,300
What about the concept of privacy in our society?

1162
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,000
In fact, we should be curious people to understand

1163
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
most of our society

1164
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,800
There should be at least a division between people

1165
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,800
where is it

1166
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,400
how do we see

1167
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,500
that this morning

1168
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,000
we hired a

1169
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,800
calligraphic calligraphy and painting art workers

1170
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,400
also a guru

1171
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,900
Mr. Zhu Zhennan went to our so-called speech

1172
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,000
Then what he said was

1173
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,800
Outsiders can't

1174
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,400
Then he was talking about a

1175
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,800
That is to say, an interaction between our art and law

1176
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,500
one thing he said

1177
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,900
Then I said that when he talked about this matter, he was very

1178
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,600
He wondered how the society has come to this level

1179
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:59,200
He feels very aura

1180
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,300
then I will talk to civilization

1181
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
The deputy director said, very good, this is what I can talk about today.

1182
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,640
A thing

1183
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,040
what did he say

1184
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,040
He said that recently, everyone understands that it is not often

1185
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,000
This court thinks that

1186
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,280
There are too many reports of violations in this report case

1187
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,240
Right? Then why are there so many reported cases?

1188
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,200
It means that the police transferred a lot, so why did the police transfer

1189
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,440
There are so many because of why many people sue

1190
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,640
many people report

1191
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,440
What about now? In our society now

1192
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,800
There are many enthusiastic

1193
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:34,360
But on the other hand, it is also possible that our law-breakers encourage such enthusiasm

1194
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,160
So he started going around to report some things he couldn't get used to.

1195
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,520
On the other hand, everyone thinks it should be good

1196
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,840
There should be some enthusiastic people in this society

1197
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,280
You should be very concerned about some social welfare matters

1198
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,760
But from another perspective, he felt that there were so many accusations

1199
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,080
Why so many cups

1200
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,560
why so many of these things

1201
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,080
What about this matter?

1202
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,700
From another point of view?

1203
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,200
In fact, it should be worthy of our concern

1204
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,800
How will our society and culture develop?

1205
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,400
because if you cut in from the other side

1206
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,800
The reason why I feel that I should share this matter with you

1207
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,300
I think it will fundamentally shape the shake

1208
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:25,200
each of us to the other

1209
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,600
we feel very enthusiastic

1210
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,200
But from another perspective

1211
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,300
For example, in terms of traffic violations

1212
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,600
What about traffic violations?

1213
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,900
Of course the capabilities of the police are limited.

1214
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,600
So what he's saying now is certainly encouraging.

1215
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,900
Everyone, if the public can take the initiative to report

1216
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,100
Even if there are some

1217
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,500
You still have to share some benefits

1218
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,500
Then everyone should also know

1219
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,700
Some people don't talk about survival because of this.

1220
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,700
At least as a side job.

1221
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,400
What about this situation, everyone?

1222
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,100
we continue to encourage

1223
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,320
if you continue

1224
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,720
trust between people

1225
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,560
between people

1226
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,920
What about this kind of interaction?

1227
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,720
Is it built on this whistle blowing culture?

1228
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,360
whistleblower culture

1229
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,720
is it good or not

1230
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,520
This is something we should really think about

1231
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,720
Then he will talk today

1232
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,560
Actually, you can't do this well

1233
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,240
When you want the people to come out instead

1234
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,720
Actually you should think about two things

1235
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,840
The first is the question of the capacity of the government

1236
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,360
you are becoming incompetent

1237
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,600
The second question to consider is that

1238
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,120
I don't even know whether the general public should be allowed to

1239
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,680
know to abide by the law

1240
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,040
minimum traffic rules

1241
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,280
or a bare minimum

1242
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,720
As a result, we don't use this to come today

1243
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,080
Instead, through what?

1244
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,120
by reporting

1245
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,800
and then through punishment

1246
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,120
then to strengthen

1247
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,840
It's you who violated me today

1248
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,760
anytime anywhere

1249
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,160
sorry

1250
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,400
you anytime, anywhere

1251
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,000
you pay attention to what's around you

1252
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,240
i obviously mean

1253
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,480
Be careful, the spies are by your side

1254
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,000
change today

1255
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,460
Be careful and resolute is by your side

1256
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,440
In that case, actually

1257
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,240
On the other hand

1258
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,640
Wait a minute, I'll tell you about it at the beginning

1259
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,320
this will follow

1260
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,680
Some developments in the kind of privacy that we are talking about today

1261
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,840
It is related to some developments in the information society

1262
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,240
Let's leave a little foreshadowing first

1263
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,300
that is

1264
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,440
such a culture

1265
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,520
In fact, he will speak slowly

1266
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,080
human interaction

1267
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,800
human interaction

1268
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,080
What kind of relationship would result in

1269
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,000
or what one looks like

1270
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,840
interactive relationship

1271
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,880
Then this situation

1272
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,040
It may be that we will spend a little more time and come back to talk to you

1273
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,560
Let me take a moment now to tell you what the right to privacy is

1274
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,360
Maybe the word here might become a comparison

1275
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,320
not very interesting

1276
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,120
Because he was entered into the legal challenge

1277
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,160
privacy is important

1278
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,920
Privacy is what we just talked about

1279
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,840
Maybe something I don't want others to know

1280
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,100
personal facts

1281
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,500
or the one i should

1282
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,400
let me have a space alone

1283
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,400
Have privacy and space

1284
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,300
but if today

1285
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,200
don't have a stake

1286
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,500
no legal right

1287
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,500
If the legal system guarantees

1288
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,800
maybe this privacy

1289
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,200
it will be violated

1290
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,500
so privacy

1291
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,500
designed words

1292
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,100
Mainly to protect personal privacy

1293
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,700
but

1294
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,000
what we want to tell you

1295
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,300
Privacy words in the modern sense of privacy

1296
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:32,800
In fact, at the end of the 19th century

1297
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,200
just started like this

1298
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,100
modern concept of privacy

1299
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:38,500
That

1300
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,500
earliest now present words

1301
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,200
in academia

1302
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,600
At least in academia

1303
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,600
When it comes to modern privacy

1304
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,100
the establishment of a system

1305
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,800
was started in 1890

1306
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,800
words from 1890

1307
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,500
these two lawyers

1308
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,900
professional lawyer at the time

1309
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,800
Both work in Boston

1310
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,900
This Samuel Warren

1311
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Louis Brandeis

1312
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,240
what they wrote

1313
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,840
Then this article is published in Hoverloo Review

1314
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,200
what is the topic of their writing

1315
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,240
The title they wrote was The Right to Privacy

1316
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,240
The Right to Privacy

1317
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,040
Then from 1890 onwards

1318
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:18,440
The words of this article gradually become a repeatedly quoted

1319
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,240
Then everyone is talking about film and television rights

1320
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,560
will come back to them in the end

1321
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,840
Of course, everyone can understand, if they should.

1322
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,080
The formation of a concept is never attributable to

1323
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,080
Home to these two today

1324
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,280
There must be a gestation period

1325
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,240
Then just this paragraph

1326
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,440
The words of the two of them caught one eye.

1327
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,000
then it came out

1328
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,600
So anyway

1329
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,200
let's talk about this article

1330
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,520
That

1331
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,640
Brandeis is a very important

1332
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,640
what about these two

1333
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,120
That was at Hoverloo School

1334
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,320
If you read books, you are bedmates

1335
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,800
First place Second place

1336
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,080
then work at the same time

1337
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,240
he is very rich

1338
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,040
he is jewish

1339
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,840
What about Brandice, who later became very famous

1340
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,160
It's not just this article

1341
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,480
It's that he later became a justice of the United States Supreme Court.

1342
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,240
justice

1343
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,800
become very important

1344
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,840
right to privacy

1345
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,160
we'll talk beyond him

1346
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,960
The words in Free Speech Studies will also talk about him

1347
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:25,340
Then we have to pay attention to the social background at that time

1348
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,140
sorry

1349
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,960
I have a bad throat recently

1350
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,520
I'm worried that there will be no sound after a while

1351
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,840
Everyone noticed that he was a

1352
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,200
From an agricultural society to an industrial society

1353
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,480
what is he doing

1354
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,760
what is he doing

1355
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,040
what is he doing

1356
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,320
what is he doing

1357
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,600
what is he doing

1358
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,880
what is he doing

1359
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,440
From an agricultural society to an industrial society

1360
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,260
Then he is an immigrant society

1361
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,400
Everyone, think about your childhood

1362
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,100
or as a child

1363
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,900
Do you all use the same childhood as us?

1364
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,000
When I was a child, I grew up as the head of the dependent village

1365
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,500
I don't know if you guys are from the general

1366
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,240
Compare

1367
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,600
Compare relatives and friends together

1368
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,700
The so-called rural society

1369
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,000
What about that kind of society?

1370
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,600
What about him because of emotions

1371
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,800
Everyone, what happened to my house?

1372
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,200
compare soon

1373
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,900
Of course, the partition wall is also poor in sound insulation.

1374
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,200
On the other hand, of course

1375
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,200
Interacting with each other is also very weak

1376
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,300
different from now

1377
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,100
you can think about it

1378
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,200
a society like that

1379
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,500
In a village where I live

1380
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,700
or live in a town

1381
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,200
or live in a place

1382
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,300
If something happens to my house

1383
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,700
everyone around knows

1384
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,300
Then what kind of Privacy is there at that time?

1385
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:56,900
At that time Privacy may

1386
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,000
No

1387
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,100
when will he

1388
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,740
Becoming a Privacy may be the conclusion of living with strangers

1389
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,960
What about this era?

1390
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,640
he might be like this for a reason

1391
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,040
They come out like this because of industrialization

1392
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,140
It's all melted

1393
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,440
what about your thoughtful person

1394
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,300
what is no more

1395
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,340
Your former uncle

1396
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,900
or auntie

1397
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,740
or these relatives and friends

1398
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,540
We've been used to it since childhood

1399
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,540
He should know what happened in my house

1400
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,140
So we're now at a

1401
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,940
is an unfamiliar environment

1402
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,140
strangers around

1403
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,940
So what about the words between strangers?

1404
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,140
don't have that kind of trust

1405
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,340
what happened to me

1406
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,540
he talks casually

1407
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,340
misunderstood by others

1408
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,540
But what if today

1409
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,440
I'm like the village I grew up in

1410
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,440
A place like this is all about me

1411
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,540
people who know me

1412
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,640
what happened to me

1413
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,640
at least they won't misread me

1414
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,340
So I'm going to say one thing here

1415
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,940
Someone will talk about what diet is

1416
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:57,640
Why should the right to food be protected?

1417
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,540
Someone cut in from this angle

1418
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,140
cut it in

1419
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,920
that is

1420
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,580
because of it

1421
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,620
Afraid that others will misinterpret it

1422
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,620
you get these messages

1423
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,620
Then your message isn't enough

1424
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:12,540
On the other hand

1425
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:13,880
You told him other than this message

1426
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,380
do you know anything else about him

1427
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:16,420
You do not get it

1428
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,920
As a result, you interpret it like this

1429
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,820
so he is also afraid

1430
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,580
So some people think that

1431
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,380
Fear of being misunderstood by others

1432
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,320
so someone said

1433
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,580
This is an alternative view on protecting the right to privacy

1434
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,320
But that point of view is relatively

1435
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,080
It was only proposed after modern times

1436
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,980
in the middle of communication

1437
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,380
no one talks about this

1438
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,240
But I think he is worth it

1439
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,080
By the way, I can share with you

1440
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,640
what is the second one

1441
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,520
The second is technology

1442
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,040
The technology at that time was called photography

1443
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,240
Now what are you guys talking about?

1444
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,960
But back then the technology of photography was amazing

1445
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,640
because it was from that time

1446
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,520
need your tripod

1447
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,440
then hit that

1448
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,360
and then what

1449
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,920
He can take it with him

1450
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,080
But at that time, the light bulb was

1451
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Throw away when you're done, Throw away when you're done

1452
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
But anyway, he was a breakthrough

1453
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
That is, he is very convenient. He is a portable

1454
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
moodable he is a mobile

1455
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So what if this is the case, everyone?

1456
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
The front Warran between the two

1457
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
He just him because his family is very rich

1458
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
What about his wife?

1459
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I also told the wife of the president at the time

1460
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
It's also a boudoir

1461
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Still a bestie, should be a bestie

1462
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
not boudoir

1463
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
They're supposed to be best friends, so they're actually one.

1464
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
In terms of politics, everyone is satisfied

1465
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I think it's number one

1466
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
So what happened to his house?

1467
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
The newspapers at that time published every episode

1468
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
So actually I should tell you one more thing

1469
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
New technologies other than these three

1470
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Information Technology In addition to this modeling technology

1471
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Another new technology is newspapers

1472
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Newspapers at the time

1473
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I ignored it here

1474
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
newspapers at the time

1475
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
So that newspaper at that time from the 19th century

1476
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
start slowly

1477
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,460
If it develops to that time, he will start to come out halfway.

1478
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,880
At that time, of course newspapers also competed with each other.

1479
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,400
he needs this too

1480
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,440
these businesses

1481
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,640
these advertisements to maintain his operations

1482
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,400
i think these words i'm not saying

1483
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,920
use him to speak now

1484
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,080
Think about it, when did he cause

1485
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,960
Proposing such a concept

1486
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,880
What is said today, what is said in our current society

1487
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,760
In fact, he made some transformations. In the middle of this transformation,

1488
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,520
In fact, he should change those concepts a bit.

1489
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,720
Well, I'm just here to tell you about this matter.

1490
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,800
so we're going to mention this

1491
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,200
other than this thing

1492
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,960
I write a lot of things that don't need to be said

1493
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,000
I'm just talking to you guys

1494
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,760
Why do they bring these things up

1495
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,920
then speak to them

1496
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,800
words in their most original sense

1497
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,720
They think it means don't get fucked

1498
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,520
just don't come and leave me alone

1499
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,720
leave me alone

1500
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:52,920
That

1501
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,600
After starting here

1502
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,200
after starting here

1503
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,960
They were proposed in 1890

1504
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,160
Afterwards, these things in the United States at that time

1505
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,160
judicial

1506
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,040
or the word of congress

1507
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,360
not too serious

1508
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:12,280
By 1901, there was even a case in the state of New York

1509
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,600
In that case, a flour mill used a

1510
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,920
Woman taking his picture as his without the woman's consent

1511
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:19,720
advertise

1512
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,200
put it on the flour sack

1513
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,840
Then what this woman said, I feel like talking about him

1514
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,640
His privacy was violated, sue this New York state

1515
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,520
The state courts did not win the state courts, I think

1516
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,560
This is an invasion of his privacy

1517
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,520
what about when you come out

1518
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,920
Many residents of the New York state who died felt that what to say

1519
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,120
It's okay to do such a thing, but you're not a New York state citizen.

1520
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,800
Actually the New York Times

1521
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,480
This is why the newspapers at that time were very important. The newspapers talked about it from the very beginning

1522
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,840
Can it be like this? After this, it will cause everyone

1523
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,040
In the field of linguistics, in the field of intellectuals, in the field of social management

1524
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,360
take things like this very seriously

1525
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,880
So, the New York State Congress will pass legislation

1526
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,680
So his earliest legislation

1527
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,400
He puts a privacy right like this

1528
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,120
the privacy they want to assert

1529
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,480
the way he passed the legislation

1530
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,880
into their torts

1531
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,720
Then the development will be very fast

1532
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:12,720
words developed later

1533
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,080
Every state is different

1534
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,120
words in some states

1535
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,960
He speaks straight to the court

1536
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,360
Just use the way of Conmannuo directly

1537
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,680
Because of Facomano's way

1538
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,160
directly into a judgment precedent

1539
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,480
other states

1540
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,040
He made it a state law

1541
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,200
Then in 1960

1542
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,520
in 1960

1543
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:29,840
this

1544
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,160
Burkeley Low School's then

1545
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,960
The dean of Burkeley Low School in the United States

1546
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,800
CalledWilliam Prosser

1547
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,080
Words from William Prosser

1548
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,720
he put this

1549
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,000
from 1960

1550
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,600
Between 1890 and 1960

1551
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,640
The court ruled that he should consult with him

1552
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:47,840
after the consultation

1553
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,480
He just said what our American society says

1554
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,400
For words like invasion of privacy

1555
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,400
The four types of privacy violations

1556
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,120
he summed him up

1557
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,120
Then let me just say it here.

1558
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,460
1890

1559
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:04,460
This Warren proposed to Brandeis

1560
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,260
When the right to privacy

1561
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:08,000
he is not created out of nothing

1562
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,460
what is he actually

1563
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:10,260
he also said

1564
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,660
I take all past court decisions

1565
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:13,660
related to these

1566
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:15,960
I think what I'm trying to bring up

1567
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,160
the right to privacy

1568
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,420
about these judgments

1569
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:19,620
he also found him

1570
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:23,120
He is through the experience of being

1571
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,660
then he put him

1572
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,420
Analysis after kneeling

1573
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:27,800
and then sum it up

1574
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,800
others did not see he saw

1575
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,860
That 1960's

1576
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,420
What about Professor Proser?

1577
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,100
He did the same

1578
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,800
same way

1579
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,660
also used the past

1580
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:50,360
That is, from 1890 to 1960

1581
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,300
Judgment of the Intermediate Court

1582
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,560
he summed him up

1583
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,360
So they basically say

1584
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,800
not they created

1585
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,720
they just take what has happened

1586
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,540
he summed him up

1587
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:00,020
so relatively

1588
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
So what about the words?

1589
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,500
The creation of your academics is sometimes quite difficult to talk about

1590
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,000
this is your unfamiliarity

1591
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
if he already exists

1592
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,500
so that others do not see

1593
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,500
I point you out

1594
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,000
In fact, he already exists there

1595
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
He's actually quite easy to move around.

1596
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,500
So they came up with these

1597
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,500
This type of infringement of film and television rights

1598
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,000
or infringement of the type of infringement of film and television rights

1599
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,000
In fact, it has affected the development of related infringements in the world.

1600
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Taiwan is particularly affected by this

1601
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
What about the impact here?

1602
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Of course mainly because

1603
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
In addition to the previous piece we just talked about

1604
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
That piece is talking

1605
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,500
From the right of secrets to the right of film and television

1606
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,000
at the turning point in the middle

1607
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
A lot of discussions there are actually talking about this thing.

1608
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
will talk about you can watch when

1609
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
America they have developed

1610
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
A so-called infringement of film and television rights

1611
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
So that's what they're talking about

1612
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
What about Germany's weakness?

1613
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
they are talking

1614
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,760
Infringement

1615
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:02,300
Tell them the right to secrecy

1616
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:05,380
Later words slowly developed to the present words come in

1617
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,680
To come in is to officially become

1618
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:10,500
But everyone should know that this is officially becoming

1619
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,040
from Taiwan

1620
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,320
law

1621
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:14,840
then it becomes

1622
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,640
It's us

1623
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,220
If someone violates my privacy, I can claim

1624
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,280
What about infringement

1625
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:23,300
is going to

1626
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,340
1990

1627
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,800
we are at

1628
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:36,920
Although we are talking about the revision of the civil law very early, we have been talking about it since the Republic of China in 1970

1629
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:37,680
Civil Law Amendment

1630
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,240
But the real civil law amendment

1631
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,260
is going to

1632
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,320
Only implemented in 1990

1633
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,880
That is in our general principles of civil law

1634
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:47,660
195 he corrected it

1635
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:48,940
so

1636
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,760
It's funny here, at least when I was a student

1637
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,300
when i was a student

1638
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:56,620
There are many cases of well-known cases

1639
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:59,640
There are many cases of well-known cases

1640
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,300
Some say it's a violation of privacy

1641
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,360
So it should be an invasion of privacy

1642
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,880
but sorry

1643
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:08,700
Because it's an invasion of privacy, you should go and read the Civil Code.

1644
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,520
Inside, Article 195 talks about invasion of privacy

1645
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:13,560
infringe on this

1646
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:16,640
If you can ask for the right to be spiritually majestic

1647
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,680
does not include privacy

1648
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,780
he has reputation health body reputation health these

1649
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,340
However, it does not include the so-called

1650
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:26,880
privacy

1651
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:27,900
so sorry

1652
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,440
he can't ask

1653
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,520
Compensation for damage

1654
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,100
At that time, apart from the privacy controversy, another

1655
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:35,880
called a quarrel

1656
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,760
At that time, there were many such sexual assault cases in Taiwanese society.

1657
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,560
What to do if you are assaulted in a sexual assault case

1658
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:45,880
So at that time, the words used to violate the body

1659
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,400
come here with your body

1660
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,960
What about privacy?

1661
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:51,760
words of some courts

1662
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,560
They accept the honor

1663
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:58,920
Came here with damage to his reputation because he couldn't find anyone who could use his privacy to claim damages

1664
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,540
So let me tell you by the way

1665
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,020
Then this is coming officially

1666
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,380
After the civil law was amended we have

1667
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:10,240
What about other than this film and television rights?

1668
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,780
if we look

1669
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:13,580
is later continued to develop

1670
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:29,720
These four types of infringement of film and television rights may wait a minute, maybe I will follow along and talk to you about that.

1671
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,240
Development of Information Technology

1672
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,520
By the way, I'll talk to you guys again

1673
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,600
The development of film and television rights, in addition to infringement

1674
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:39,680
It's civil, it's between us private and private

1675
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:41,220
if we are here

1676
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:44,040
between private and private if my

1677
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:47,880
If my video is infringed on by others, I can come and request

1678
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:49,420
This damage is very

1679
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,480
On the other hand, you can understand that

1680
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:57,600
If he is that important, is there any criminal case other than private through civil

1681
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,900
In the middle of a criminal case, we can also later

1682
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,600
Seeing that there is crime of harm prevention secret

1683
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,400
The most typical one is

1684
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,000
Because real hole photography has come out

1685
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,500
Words to prevent pore photography after it has come out

1686
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,700
cause a lot of things like this

1687
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,700
I was in a private space

1688
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:15,900
I don't want others to know

1689
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:20,200
It turns out that you used this porosity camera to invade

1690
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,300
so soon after

1691
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,800
Once it is revised in the criminal law, it will be over soon.

1692
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:27,600
Because the social groups at that time felt that

1693
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,000
how can it be like this

1694
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,500
So we have both civil law and criminal law

1695
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,200
What about later?

1696
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,800
Actually faster

1697
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,700
In addition to civil law and criminal law

1698
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,300
It is faster development in Taiwan

1699
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,000
He is upside down with America

1700
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,200
It's the other way around with Europe

1701
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,400
It is because our administrative regulations existed earlier

1702
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,700
In the words of our administrative regulations

1703
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,800
at least since 1988

1704
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,900
or before 1989

1705
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,700
We should have some regulations

1706
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:53,500
he will come

1707
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:56,700
it will be regulated

1708
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:00,200
You can't invade someone's special identity

1709
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,280
human his privacy

1710
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,640
So we can see several conditions

1711
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,080
A few words from this section on privacy protection

1712
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,400
The first thing we saw was to start from the act of clearing up rights in civil law

1713
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,960
Then, if this is the case, if it is the development of the United States

1714
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,080
He later arrived in the 1960s

1715
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,080
started another wave

1716
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,960
Except we just talked about the 1960s

1717
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:25,400
Professor Proser's words, he summed up the behavior of clearing power

1718
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,440
Note also that in the 1960s and 1970s

1719
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:32,880
In the middle, the computerization at that time

1720
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,240
he also showed up

1721
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,400
So when computerization comes

1722
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,080
make American society, those they start to worry about

1723
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:44,360
Personal information, will it be the result of computerization?

1724
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,480
he was violated

1725
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:49,200
So they started another wave a new one

1726
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:53,200
A direction to protect the right to privacy through legislation

1727
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,480
Then this area is actually in the United States and Europe

1728
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,680
Maybe they were more advanced then

1729
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,400
So it's weird what I was talking about

1730
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,240
Why after the 1970s

1731
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,240
The word our photographer is positioned

1732
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Is that what the world cared about at the time?

1733
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,600
new cinematographer concept

1734
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,440
When a new photographer invades

1735
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,240
some fads are related

1736
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,640
Since the late 1960s and into the 1970s

1737
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:27,040
The most discussed part in the middle is about the computerization of personal data

1738
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,200
If personal data is computerized

1739
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,360
They found out that the words

1740
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,840
Simply through civil tort is not enough

1741
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:35,640
because what is that

1742
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,240
between private and private

1743
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,040
Today is the country to invade me

1744
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,520
computerization of the country

1745
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,040
Then he came to collect a lot of statistics

1746
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,760
Census Statistics

1747
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,400
How can these things be replaced?

1748
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,960
So they started to legislate

1749
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,440
to do this

1750
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:55,640
Of course, the most famous and typical one is the protection of personal data.

1751
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,400
So after the 70s words

1752
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,360
new wave

1753
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,960
In addition to infringement, another wave of words

1754
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,760
It's Personal Therapy Protection, and it's been around since then.

1755
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,960
just like that

1756
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,800
That

1757
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,600
What about Taiwan?

1758
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,600
Taiwan

1759
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,800
Our development just reversed

1760
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,200
if pure if pure

1761
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,460
From that legal title

1762
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,900
In this way, our privacy protection

1763
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,000
we may be upside down

1764
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,160
We are first prescribed by law

1765
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,400
Some provisions of administrative law

1766
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,920
like i just talked about

1767
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,120
words from 1989

1768
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,120
Possibly in banking law

1769
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,120
words in banking law

1770
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,520
for bank customers

1771
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,320
His personal financial information

1772
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,920
should be maintained

1773
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,420
that privacy

1774
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:39,420
What if we come again?

1775
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:40,520
is typical

1776
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:43,320
Computer Processing Personal Therapy Protection Act

1777
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,020
Words of the Computerized Personal Therapy Protection Act

1778
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,020
before what

1779
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:48,520
amendments prior to civil law

1780
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,120
What about the reason?

1781
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,620
There may be other reasons behind

1782
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:53,920
Computer Processing Personal Therapy Protection Act

1783
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,520
The reason why I asked quickly was because

1784
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:00,120
At that time, Taiwan hoped to become an Asia-Pacific operation

1785
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Operations Center

1786
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
In order to become the Asia-Pacific operations center

1787
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
to know that means I need to accept

1788
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
If we wish to put

1789
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Other companies that have become multinational

1790
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Ability to set up in Taiwan

1791
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
set up his Asia-Pacific

1792
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
If the head office is located in Taiwan

1793
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
then these companies

1794
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
A profile at some other company should be able to

1795
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Find a way to come to Taiwan

1796
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Taiwan also has to find a way

1797
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Relevant transaction information should also be found out

1798
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
if you're going to be like this

1799
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
but noticed

1800
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
what we're talking about is saying

1801
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Because of personal data protection this started

1802
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
that in Europe at the time

1803
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
European Community

1804
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
economic community

1805
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
predecessor of the european union

1806
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
words of the predecessor of the european union

1807
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
They also had a word about this matter very early

1808
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
they also care

1809
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
So they've made a spec

1810
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
This specification is

1811
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
There are regulations on so-called safe harbors

1812
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
It's today

1813
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
with these countries in the European Union

1814
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
sorry eu

1815
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
that was the european union

1816
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,020
that economy

1817
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:01,800
We will then

1818
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:03,320
Since everyone in the European Union is better than him

1819
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:04,600
Just say it is the European Union

1820
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:07,420
If you want to share the economy with me

1821
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:08,700
economic community

1822
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,520
If you want to be an official and do these business dealings

1823
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,560
It specifically mentioned what this is

1824
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,360
My information is from

1825
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:18,180
countries of the european community

1826
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,720
to another country

1827
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:21,240
this kind

1828
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,800
Information flow across borders

1829
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,340
He has one request

1830
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:29,960
To stay in that country, that country must have the same norms

1831
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,600
Protection of personal data

1832
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,440
Otherwise, my information will pass

1833
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:38,140
Therefore, everyone is very clear about this situation. If Taiwan wants to become this

1834
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,940
Words from the Asia-Pacific Immigration Center

1835
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,080
then what becomes

1836
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,260
I also have to have the same specification

1837
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,060
So when we

1838
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,120
This computer processing personal data protection law will pass soon

1839
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:53,760
In fact, if what we are doing is advanced in the legal field, everyone can understand

1840
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:57,600
In fact, there were actually a lot of discussions at that time, and other proposals were quickly passed.

1841
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,040
So we went through the computer first

1842
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,200
The Personal Data Protection Act and then come back to have amendments to the civil law

1843
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:06,760
and then put this tort part

1844
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,080
With film and television rights

1845
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,080
So our development

1846
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,240
no the same

1847
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,080
But now the word is through these

1848
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,320
But there's another, more important part, a more important one

1849
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,000
partly

1850
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,880
Is he a de jure right after all we talked about

1851
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,160
what is

1852
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:24,880
he's a civil tort he's a legal tort

1853
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,240
he is personal computer personal data processing personal data protection law

1854
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:31,360
If the protection of personal data in that personal data

1855
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,040
If there is also protection of film and television rights, what is he?

1856
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,560
He is also a legal interest

1857
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,240
So is he a constitutional right?

1858
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,600
If he goes over the Constitution of the Republic of China

1859
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:42,520
in our constitution

1860
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,440
no mention of video rights

1861
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,000
So what about film rights?

1862
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,300
If you want to realize it well, you can't control it well

1863
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,100
Before the unification of the information society, the time is approaching

1864
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,400
So I'm going to enter the information society soon

1865
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:21,500
If our justice is the part of the constitution that protects the right to privacy

1866
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,300
through the justice's explanation

1867
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:26,360
So now in our Taiwan

1868
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:28,160
privacy

1869
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,220
the right to privacy it's also a power in the constitution

1870
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,800
we can't jump

1871
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,380
We Christian Information Society

1872
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,700
Everyone in the information society think about a question

1873
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,320
Everyone use mobile phones

1874
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,100
right

1875
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:48,900
Is there anyone without a cell phone?

1876
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,220
have all

1877
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,580
Everyone uses a mobile phone, so you can understand why you use a mobile phone

1878
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:59,400
Mobile phones have become an indispensable part of our daily life.

1879
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
very convenient, isn't it

1880
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I take out my phone when I do something

1881
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Maybe there are many people now

1882
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Not looking at me, but looking at me through the phone

1883
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
If this happens, there are many of you, right?

1884
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
As we said before, many people are obsessed with mobile phones

1885
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
To what extent are you lost in your phone? Between each other

1886
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
If you are in the middle of the same crime, if you are chatting with each other

1887
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Not talking, but through the phone

1888
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
this is very common

1889
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
that statement or phenomenon

1890
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
It's just describing why the phone it becomes

1891
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Indispensable in daily life

1892
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
But the reason why we become indispensable

1893
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
It's because it provides us with too many convenient services, right?

1894
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Where am I going today I can't find

1895
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Where is our original branch, I always Google Map

1896
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Or map, it just points out Habang

1897
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
If it wins, I just follow it and get there, right?

1898
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
That's convenient, but the same

1899
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,000
I want to enjoy such a service actually

1900
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I have to give my information out

1901
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
come in exchange

1902
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
when i'm going to

1903
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,500
when I use Google Maps

1904
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,500
What will I definitely use?

1905
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,000
you must provide say

1906
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
where am i now

1907
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
So this kind of location

1908
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Information about personal location

1909
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
you have to swap out

1910
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
the same thing too much

1911
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
So today's current words

1912
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I'm here to ask you

1913
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Everyone, do you know

1914
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
If you are using your mobile phone

1915
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
There is so much information exchanged

1916
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
words of information

1917
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
not just us

1918
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
And it's anything we just need to surf the Internet on our mobile phone

1919
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
That's basically information on mobile phones

1920
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Then on the other hand

1921
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
everyone starts today

1922
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
often tell you

1923
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
words on your phone

1924
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
need to be updated

1925
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
The apps inside should also be updated

1926
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Much

1927
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I update every day

1928
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
how did he know about you

1929
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
What about updating?

1930
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
when i update my app

1931
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Do you want to check out your other stuff by the way?

1932
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,400
so in many cases

1933
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,000
when we use mobile phones

1934
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,600
In fact, a lot of information has been exchanged

1935
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,200
then i don't know guys

1936
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,600
what do you think about this

1937
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,200
I think this information is irrelevant

1938
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,200
It doesn't matter if he takes it

1939
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,800
Maybe you all think that

1940
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,200
this has nothing to do with my privacy

1941
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,200
nothing to do with my privacy

1942
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,600
It may also be that

1943
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,400
Although he has something to do with my privacy

1944
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,200
but you have a way

1945
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,000
if not

1946
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,200
How to do it

1947
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:34,000
Then I will become an off-screen name

1948
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,200
So in this case

1949
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,400
we are curious

1950
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,600
In fact, many things today are like this

1951
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,400
we just talked about cell phone

1952
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,200
In fact, inside the National Taiwan University campus

1953
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,400
We are looking inside the original

1954
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:49,400
I've seen several cameras

1955
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,100
then go out

1956
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,000
probably a lot of cameras

1957
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,700
To maintain campus safety

1958
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:54,900
There are also many cameras

1959
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,500
In fact, any street

1960
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,500
You can see the camera when you enter privately

1961
01:17:58,500 --> 01:17:59,700
then we take a taxi

1962
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:00,200
taxi

1963
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Driving machine

1964
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Then wherever you go

1965
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Everyone is watching us and we are watching others

1966
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
So now the current words

1967
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
probably into a

1968
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Big Brother like 1984

1969
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Watching you all the time, except for the government

1970
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
What else is there besides this big brother?

1971
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
And these are our Rolomon

1972
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
These little big brothers or little big sisters

1973
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
we are helping big brother

1974
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
So now society has become

1975
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
enter into a

1976
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
people are changing

1977
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Under surveillance, all the people are also there

1978
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
one who watches over others

1979
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
This is monitoring

1980
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
severance

1981
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
In this case, there is actually a risk

1982
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
We just said that everyone is

1983
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Report and report

1984
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
If any

1985
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
we live in a so-called

1986
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
In the era when all the people are being monitored

1987
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Actually what does it mean here?

1988
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
In fact, it is a discipline function

1989
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
we pass this way

1990
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
The most typical statement is

1991
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
benson

1992
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,300
This British philosopher Benton invented

1993
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:03,800
the so-called prototype prison theory

1994
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:05,700
The words of his archetypal prison theory are

1995
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:08,000
He can design this kind of prison called a prototype

1996
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,700
He just needs to have a warden in the middle of this prison

1997
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:15,000
He can see inside every precaution

1998
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
everyone is active

1999
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,100
Then don't those in the prevention

2000
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:21,000
the words of the prisoners

2001
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,300
he can't see this admin

2002
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,600
he can see them he can't see him

2003
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,900
And what will he become in the last words?

2004
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,700
None of this admin needs to exist

2005
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:29,500
because of what

2006
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,700
They don't know he can't see

2007
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,300
Are the admins watching them?

2008
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,500
But he'll take it to mean they're looking at them

2009
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,300
just like today

2010
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:37,400
today's words

2011
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,900
I honestly don't know if anyone is watching me

2012
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,300
But I know someone is watching me

2013
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:45,600
That's an unknowable

2014
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,000
What is the most troublesome thing today?

2015
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,200
The most troublesome thing is

2016
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,800
we don't know

2017
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,500
Information about who we are personally

2018
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:57,500
by what kind of person

2019
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:00,100
By what means does he collect

2020
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,460
We don't know where he's stored

2021
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,860
Then how he was used we don't know

2022
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,460
We don't know what the result of his use is.

2023
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:08,960
this is now

2024
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,460
To be honest, for me to do a research on shadow rights

2025
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:14,460
To be honest, I have been talking to foreign scholars

2026
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:17,960
I'm sorry, a lot of things are actually in my imagination

2027
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,960
because we have no data

2028
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,960
if you do research

2029
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,960
Of course you need to know what reality is

2030
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,960
You don't know reality, that's all you're imagining

2031
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,960
but what is the reality

2032
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,960
reality is we don't know

2033
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,960
Our profile Says our profile on the Internet

2034
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,960
I don't know if I'm used to it

2035
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,960
Do you have our information over there? We don't know either.

2036
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,960
No matter how our data is used, we don’t know

2037
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,960
Do not know at all

2038
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,960
In this case, it is irresistible to care

2039
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,960
So today we will follow

2040
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,960
Sorry, I should have said this earlier today.

2041
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:52,960
In fact, one important thing is

2042
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,960
we have to understand

2043
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,960
The exchange of social information today

2044
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,560
It is indispensable in our daily life

2045
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:05,120
There's really no way around this

2046
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:06,660
but

2047
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:09,980
He should be a norm that must be justified

2048
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,780
reasonable management

2049
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,600
But we don't know what the mechanism is

2050
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:17,920
Thanks

2051
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,500
So this is a question we want to talk to you today

2052
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:24,840
Well, we actually have some regulations in the law.

2053
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:28,160
What about this law? For example, we just talked about the Personal Data Protection Law.

2054
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,460
Or like some legal regulations just mentioned

2055
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,260
He actually had a hypothesis

2056
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,040
because we just talked about privacy

2057
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:36,860
In privacy, there is one thing he calls

2058
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,420
I want to be in charge, I want to make my own decisions

2059
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:44,540
So, when protecting everyone's privacy through the law through the right to privacy of the law?

2060
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:45,560
he has one thing

2061
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,400
It's very important, everyone may have heard it.

2062
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:50,440
Hidden consent

2063
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,480
be informed first

2064
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:54,520
Then with your consent

2065
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:57,080
Then this becomes everything looks legal

2066
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:00,100
access to information

2067
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,100
The collection, storage and utilization of this collection

2068
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,640
is also true

2069
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,440
If you have the consent of the parties

2070
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:09,720
ok

2071
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,280
Then we'll look at the consent of the parties.

2072
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,600
In fact, everyone

2073
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,920
We agree to so many things without knowing it

2074
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:20,480
Yes or no

2075
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,560
Like say you are using your phone today

2076
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:26,360
use your computer use your many things

2077
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:29,960
He always asks if you agree or not

2078
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,780
can you disagree

2079
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:34,060
if you disagree

2080
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:36,360
then it's gone

2081
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,660
so it's an exchange

2082
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,720
One more troublesome thing is to say

2083
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:45,580
i have no idea what i'm agreeing to

2084
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:46,860
Yes or no

2085
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:50,700
Because he said so many terms

2086
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:53,260
Turns out we're more fun

2087
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,800
The contradictory thing is this

2088
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:55,560
that is

2089
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:58,380
You can't protect consumers

2090
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:59,920
You can't speak so clearly

2091
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
As a result, he wanted to speak more clearly and longer

2092
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
then you don't even want to see

2093
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Isn't that right? And a lot of them are weak in principle, weak in principle.

2094
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
He thinks about it very carefully

2095
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
But will you watch it?

2096
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I'm bored. Maybe your first time will look good.

2097
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
After reading the first page, there are still so many pages to read. Forget it.

2098
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
agree agree agree

2099
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Has anyone disagreed?

2100
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
If you don't agree, don't use him

2101
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
But the troublesome thing is that we have no way today not to use

2102
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:41,000
He has become an indispensable part of our daily life, so many of our services are like this

2103
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
But everyone, you can take your time to see more and more things

2104
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Tell us right now that the internal Fins IoT is coming

2105
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Then today's words, the words of data collection

2106
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:55,000
He is no longer his collection of data intruding on these things you use

2107
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Objects are collecting data anytime, anywhere

2108
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
The bigger technology behind that

2109
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,400
Everyone heard big data

2110
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,500
Here comes the technology

2111
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,300
technology, the better the technology

2112
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,400
Everyone just needs more information

2113
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,200
Yes or no

2114
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,700
then hear it say

2115
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,500
Our new AI for you is here

2116
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:11,700
so we used to

2117
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:13,500
We were telling a joke the other day

2118
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,500
Well, in the future we are actually very convenient

2119
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,000
Because we all have AI in front

2120
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,200
So what if I continue with you?

2121
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,800
Actually we were saying

2122
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,600
How do you know that what you make is not written by AI

2123
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,800
Then another sentence says

2124
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,200
Then how do you know that what I wrote to you was not written by AI

2125
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,200
They communicate with each other than directly

2126
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,800
In fact, we are all doing next to

2127
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,800
In fact, AI is doing everything for us

2128
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:37,000
In fact, he may be like this in the future

2129
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,800
So in this situation

2130
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,200
what should we do

2131
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,700
We just talked about the fact

2132
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:44,500
The thing that should matter is a transparent

2133
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:45,900
Actually we don't need much

2134
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:47,800
one thing you want is

2135
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,900
please let us know

2136
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,300
you are probably currently

2137
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,200
what technology do you use

2138
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:56,400
What kind of information is being collected from me

2139
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,600
How do you use this information?

2140
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,000
what did he do

2141
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,600
Today, maybe we can ask the government like this

2142
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,100
But the government did not respond

2143
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,800
Maybe today, you see, there's no way to respond except the government

2144
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,700
We also want the government to help us fight some

2145
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:13,900
These private, these large corporations

2146
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:16,900
In fact, if we look from the other side

2147
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,900
In fact, some phenomena can also be seen

2148
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:24,200
Facebook Google these two big three

2149
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:28,200
This is a so-called mid-level media service industry in the middle of the Internet

2150
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:29,800
intermediaries

2151
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:33,300
In fact, their services are almost in the

2152
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,800
in the middle of our daily life

2153
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:38,900
That's what we can see developing in the U.S.

2154
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,700
Following the development in Europe, the impact on these two companies

2155
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:42,900
maybe too same

2156
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:46,900
Then we have recently seen a series of words in the United States

2157
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:48,200
they will think that

2158
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,800
because they want to maintain a so-called

2159
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,300
The technology of this technology

2160
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,800
or from the Internet

2161
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,200
Should be a new chart

2162
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:00,100
So these should

2163
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,200
For the intermediary part, he should be neutral

2164
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,800
So speaking neutral means to say

2165
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,600
The government basically does not intervene

2166
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:08,100
What about his kind of service?

2167
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:09,500
he will flourish

2168
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,500
Then you can think about it

2169
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,600
What if today's intermediary service industry

2170
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,300
He has a lot of liability

2171
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:16,800
he has many legal responsibilities

2172
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,600
He may worry at every turn

2173
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,200
What if I will be sued?

2174
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,200
On the other hand, he told you

2175
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,700
as long as you don't intervene yourself

2176
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,400
don't write it yourself

2177
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:29,700
you don't edit

2178
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,600
you don't check

2179
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,500
you are all right

2180
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:33,800
this is in america

2181
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,200
But what about today?

2182
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,700
you can see europe he's not like that

2183
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,300
So we can see what the EU says

2184
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:39,200
he has some cases

2185
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,100
Even Canada has some cases

2186
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,500
for Facebook or for Google

2187
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:46,300
So this is basically thinking

2188
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:47,700
what are we looking at

2189
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:48,700
we see now

2190
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:50,700
these other advanced countries

2191
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,600
how do they come through

2192
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,700
what mechanism to protect these

2193
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:57,100
General user or consumer

2194
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:59,900
Then we can first see that

2195
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,760
there are some strange

2196
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,560
So how does Taiwan go?

2197
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:07,680
Taiwan is a relatively difficult place, we must face the reality

2198
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:08,960
we are small

2199
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,260
how much leverage do we have

2200
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,100
If today, I'll go somewhere, I'll deal with one

2201
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,400
An intermediaries of transnational

2202
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:19,960
I said you have to conform, if you don’t conform, you can’t do it

2203
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,240
will he talk to us

2204
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:27,140
So this is also some reality, so we all know these realities

2205
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:29,440
what should we do

2206
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,800
In fact, this is something we should think about

2207
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,380
There are actually a lot of words today

2208
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:38,960
We just cut this information from the perspective of film and television rights

2209
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:42,800
When it comes in, everyone will say that I don’t want to circulate information. I don’t want to circulate information.

2210
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:43,820
not that

2211
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:44,600
not that

2212
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:50,220
The open circulation of information is a very important aspect of the progress of human civilization.

2213
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:50,740
Base

2214
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:52,520
you can think about it

2215
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:57,900
If there is a free flow of information, our knowledge exchange and our access to information can promote our

2216
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:58,420
Knowledge

2217
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Let us have a lot of new developments

2218
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
It's all a human being exchanging information with each other.

2219
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Say we can't ignore this

2220
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
But in the free flow of information

2221
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Between the protection of personal privacy

2222
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
we have to have a balance

2223
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
If the balance

2224
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Today is not about us closing our eyes and covering them

2225
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
If your head is in the sand

2226
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
we don't care

2227
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
it will naturally become good

2228
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
In fact, what we see today is that

2229
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Your government must be very real to face such things

2230
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
that information

2231
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
you if you say yes

2232
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I should develop Big Data today

2233
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I want to develop AI

2234
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I want to develop many, many things

2235
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
In fact, I have to provide a lot of information

2236
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I have to collect a lot of information

2237
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I want to develop my business industry

2238
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I also need a lot of information

2239
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
we all know that

2240
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
But on the other hand

2241
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
that person's privacy

2242
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
personal information

2243
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Shouldn't it also be properly protected?

2244
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
the protection that now provides

2245
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Those words are actually what we have to face.

2246
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
So I because of time

2247
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
The last thing I want to share with you is

2248
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
if we personally

2249
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Each of us cares about our personal privacy

2250
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
then you really have to care about privacy

2251
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
you have to think about it

2252
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
if you do anything today

2253
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
that with your personal privacy

2254
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
is it related

2255
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
On the other hand, of course

2256
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
we probably know

2257
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
words in the middle of modern society

2258
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
many of our services

2259
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Or something we want to use in our daily life

2260
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
words of essential things today

2261
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
It is through the exchange of personal data

2262
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
exchanged like this

2263
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
there is no way

2264
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
On the other hand

2265
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
We must also use these words of appeal

2266
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
may make everyone understand

2267
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
You can't just sit there and wait

2268
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Because if you just sit there and wait

2269
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
If the government does nothing

2270
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Then in this situation

2271
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Many things are only getting worse

2272
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
And then when you start going in like for example

2273
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,360
you can op out

2274
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:04,640
you can op out

2275
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:06,840
you can refuse

2276
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:08,000
i terminated

2277
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,640
But here comes the next controversy

2278
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:11,640
What should I do if the front has already flowed out?

2279
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
information our most difficult place

2280
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,160
Just when the shadow sealed Kang Sheng

2281
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,640
We think the hardest part is

2282
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:18,640
Let's assume

2283
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,000
i am one i know

2284
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
i love my privacy

2285
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
I also know a lot of things

2286
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
But the next thing is

2287
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Because the current information

2288
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
the development of a technology

2289
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
we just talked about big data

2290
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
such a development

2291
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
It actually becomes a situation

2292
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
is out of our control

2293
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
is information

2294
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
It data its cumulative effect

2295
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
original words

2296
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
You can see the words in the Personal Data Protection Act

2297
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
it talks a lot

2298
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
This is also a worldwide

2299
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Everyone can only talk

2300
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
If you want to protect a personal data

2301
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Under such circumstances

2302
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
there is one thing you can do

2303
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
if you do this

2304
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Let's just assume it's like this

2305
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
what's the matter

2306
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
de-identification

2307
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,120
We study the words of many colleagues

2308
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,360
What everyone can understand is to say

2309
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:05,960
In the personal data protection law

2310
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,360
referred to in Article 6

2311
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,160
Or in 19, 20

2312
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:11,200
It was mentioned on 19 and 80

2313
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,160
he talked about it

2314
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:13,640
de-identification

2315
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,200
He means de-identification

2316
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,320
This is actually in the EU

2317
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:18,640
He also talks about de-identification

2318
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,840
You just have to de-identify

2319
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,760
Information flow should be no problem

2320
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,480
But he ignored the development of information technology

2321
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:27,160
After de-identification, he can re-identify

2322
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:28,920
That's the problem now

2323
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,840
What is it in the words of identification?

2324
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,080
more information

2325
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,880
The easier it is for him to recognize

2326
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,400
So re-identification

2327
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,120
Originally de-identification

2328
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:40,360
Now it's re-identification

2329
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:42,000
that on the other hand is

2330
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,240
we don't know what to say

2331
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:46,200
Even if we really all know about it

2332
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:47,200
Everything

2333
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,120
If I personally know what went out

2334
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,320
thought about it

2335
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:53,200
But we don't know the information going out

2336
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:56,000
What is the effect of the addition behind him?

2337
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
this is what we don't know

2338
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
so many things are

2339
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,020
we do not know

2340
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:02,300
we know

2341
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,580
no way to control

2342
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,120
Under such circumstances

2343
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:05,880
what should we do

2344
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:07,180
we may ask the government

2345
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:09,220
If the government does nothing

2346
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:09,720
also have problems

2347
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:11,520
So I personally would think that

2348
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,820
In fact, the government should deal with this matter

2349
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,360
then put some

2350
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:16,900
such a difficulty

2351
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,940
He should discuss it openly

2352
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,500
Therefore, if we pass legislation

2353
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,560
At least in the middle of the halls of Congress

2354
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:25,340
he has room for discussion

2355
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:26,120
Bundle

2356
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:27,400
spread out

2357
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:28,680
we make choices

2358
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,540
What about before this?

2359
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:33,840
can only say

2360
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:35,640
Good luck to everyone

2361
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,980
ok thank you guys i'll stop here for now

2362
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:47,920
this

2363
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:48,940
make this

2364
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:51,500
take a breath in your hand

2365
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:52,780
give him a break

2366
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,600
this i think we just heard this

2367
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:59,180
Professor Lin has many very enlightening talks

2368
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:00,140
That

2369
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I find this very interesting

2370
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:04,160
I also think that means

2371
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,640
what he talks about you can see this

2372
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:10,200
How is modern society different from traditional society?

2373
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:12,800
What is he talking about about privacy?

2374
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:15,560
What do you talk about in traditional society?

2375
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:17,600
must be fun

2376
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:21,320
Because the first we know that this traditional society follows

2377
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:23,520
between public and private

2378
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:24,480
Change

2379
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,760
what do you think you can't tell others

2380
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:29,720
should tell others

2381
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,960
you have nothing to hide like this

2382
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:36,800
It can be seen that the changes in this society are indeed very fast.

2383
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:41,080
Then I think this is called a study of intellectual history

2384
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:41,960
very interesting

2385
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:45,920
You can look at traditional people's views on public and private

2386
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,040
with us modern

2387
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:49,560
Because of the changes in social technology

2388
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:51,360
he is very different

2389
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,400
So while he was talking I was comparing

2390
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,680
How would Song-Ming Neo-Confucians respond to him?

2391
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,100
So I think the person who said this wants to talk about this right to privacy

2392
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:04,060
very problematic

2393
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:07,820
This he becomes you to talk about privacy

2394
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:09,900
means you must be morally flawed

2395
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:12,700
so this is fun

2396
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:13,660
i just heard

2397
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:17,260
This is what you told Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming in ancient times

2398
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:18,940
You must be a villain

2399
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:23,500
What right do you have to defend your rights?

2400
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:24,860
this is even weirder

2401
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,900
So the society is actually

2402
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:29,880
This has changed a lot

2403
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:34,860
But now I will leave this time open for you to ask questions

2404
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:37,180
Then there is an encouragement among us

2405
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:39,300
Anyone who asks a question

2406
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:43,220
We'll send a Scientist magazine

2407
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:45,060
Only those who have questions

2408
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:48,380
This is what I was ordered to announce to you just now

2409
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:50,020
then we stay

2410
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:53,260
You can see it there in a little while

2411
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:55,060
this is very beautiful

2412
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:57,300
very good magazine

2413
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,060
then i miss everyone

2414
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,780
Will use the industry to feel expensive

2415
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:04,860
Many of the high-tech technologies that the teacher just talked about

2416
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:07,160
The helplessness of using electronic products

2417
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:08,200
I am

2418
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,000
I don't feel anything

2419
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,540
because there is no way

2420
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:17,160
But you have observed a phenomenon over the past few years

2421
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:19,960
It means you watch any news

2422
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:21,000
any one

2423
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,560
news at any time

2424
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:26,620
You will see that our news seems to have become one

2425
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:29,440
Surveillance Video News

2426
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:30,200
That

2427
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:37,640
In the early years and a few years ago, there was a big debate in the society whether to install a lot of monitors

2428
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:43,520
Of course, the reason of the security unit of the police force is that this is a problem of public security.

2429
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:48,640
Human rights can be compromised a bit, basically I can barely accept it.

2430
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:49,920
brought in

2431
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,500
after playing on tv

2432
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,060
Someone may speak next

2433
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:59,840
It's almost a mold to operate like this

2434
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,700
Some things after sacrificing human rights

2435
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:06,400
But if you question this phenomenon today

2436
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,400
Then they will also say that we have mosaics

2437
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:11,400
No, we have to cover our faces too.

2438
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:14,400
Just like what the teacher said just now

2439
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,400
so-called differentiation

2440
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,900
What does the teacher think about this phenomenon?

2441
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:19,900
Thanks

2442
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:22,200
In fact, it is useless in the end to say goodbye

2443
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:24,200
Because Xiao Min found you out soon

2444
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:27,600
Of course, this phenomenon is actually a

2445
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,100
It is also a last resort

2446
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,500
That's called the Great Wall of Electronics

2447
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:35,500
That many of our governments, local governments or communities

2448
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,700
he will feel that we need to restructure

2449
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:38,900
Our Great Wall of Electronics

2450
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:41,800
That's because they figured out that monitors are basically

2451
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:45,000
A very low cost but

2452
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,000
The psychological effect is great

2453
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:49,600
as long as he is there

2454
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,000
For many others, as we just said, he has a disciplinary function.

2455
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:54,100
You don't know if he has it there

2456
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,400
Is it useful, you don't know if it is really useful

2457
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,000
On the other hand, I don’t know if anyone

2458
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,500
I'm really looking at you and I don't know

2459
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,300
this is a problem

2460
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:04,300
Well, what you just said actually involved a few things.

2461
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:06,300
One is to say what we see is to say

2462
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:08,300
there are these monitors everywhere

2463
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:09,800
What about these monitors?

2464
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:14,300
Everyone knows that now with the facial recognition system

2465
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:15,300
basically

2466
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:19,600
There is probably nowhere for a man to escape

2467
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,600
Wherever you go, everyone will know who you are

2468
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,800
that is fast

2469
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,500
Because the facial recognition system is better now

2470
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:29,300
That day my assistant showed me the new Economics

2471
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:32,000
He has said that he is not just a facial recognition system

2472
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:32,800
He is through technology

2473
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,200
He even backtracked and said

2474
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,500
if i knew your genes

2475
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,000
I also know what you'll look like

2476
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,600
Then I heard wow how could this be like this

2477
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,700
it's not that's another thing

2478
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:43,700
But that means there's nothing to hide from

2479
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:44,800
what about this

2480
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,200
There is actually something deeper behind that

2481
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,200
Can the media do something like this?

2482
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:51,500
of course

2483
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,400
who gave it to the media

2484
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,400
Of course people are our parties

2485
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:58,400
Like, for example, we used to have a dispute

2486
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,000
it's you

2487
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Let's not talk about the normal one

2488
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
you passed through you if we were driving today

2489
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
For driving, we have a driving recorder installed.

2490
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
What about the driving recorder? When can you use it?

2491
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Use the record in that driving recorder

2492
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:18,000
The truth is, it should be your own car accident.

2493
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
or when there is a flip gain

2494
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,000
You can take out the record of your driving recorder

2495
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Can you tell someone else what you said in your driving record?

2496
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,000
to report on someone, to report on someone, to report on someone

2497
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
This place actually has problems

2498
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Then what I was talking about just now is that behind this

2499
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
If we don't talk about the media today, we were talking about it just now.

2500
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,000
We're doing something else to encourage everyone to report

2501
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
For some traffic safety accidents, we will report

2502
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
How about a culture like this?

2503
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
What about everyone we meet in the future?

2504
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Is it just

2505
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
In fact, what we need is between people

2506
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
There is also a certain degree of mutual trust

2507
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
If the result is slow now

2508
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,000
For such a mutual trust, it may take

2509
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
have to reach

2510
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,200
Is that right?

2511
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:03,500
I think it's some problem

2512
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:05,060
really some problems

2513
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:09,900
I know it's a surveillance camera

2514
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:10,800
surveillance video recorder

2515
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:12,000
the back looks like this

2516
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,100
Surveillance video recorder if it goes down

2517
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:14,800
it goes like this

2518
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:17,200
Surveillance video camera current situation

2519
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:18,660
before we usually

2520
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:20,160
if we do anything

2521
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,360
what is usually

2522
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:23,860
after what happened to you

2523
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:26,400
We're just starting to hold people accountable

2524
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:27,420
let's go find

2525
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:28,660
like for example happened bro

2526
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:30,660
For some administrative cases

2527
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:32,160
Let's go find the criminal rights suspect

2528
01:39:32,660 --> 01:39:33,800
not now

2529
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,260
now our way words

2530
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:36,760
already called prevention

2531
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:39,820
we're not here to punish after the fact

2532
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:41,060
but by preventing

2533
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,120
prevention is now

2534
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:44,560
we are actually

2535
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:45,960
imagine

2536
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:48,520
data to basically do anything

2537
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:50,560
In fact, it provides some preventive

2538
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:51,920
and it's immediate

2539
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:52,960
then immediately

2540
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,360
and even he can tell you

2541
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:55,320
I don't just react immediately

2542
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:57,020
I can prevent you again right away

2543
01:39:57,220 --> 01:39:57,900
I can tell you

2544
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:59,960
What about those places?

2545
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,160
may be crime area

2546
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:03,660
who speaks for himself

2547
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:05,000
he may have some

2548
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,460
may be guilty

2549
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:08,460
that or something

2550
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:10,660
Then this thing becomes preventive

2551
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:12,660
That's what we have now

2552
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:13,860
maybe some problems

2553
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:15,160
so what do you want now

2554
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:17,300
It's called Video on the Mac

2555
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:20,160
so i took it all

2556
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:21,660
Because of current technology

2557
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:22,960
let me have this situation

2558
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:23,960
I can put social

2559
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:25,260
take everything

2560
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:26,760
through my official

2561
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:27,500
what else

2562
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:29,260
Private Service Efforts

2563
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:31,260
official with what

2564
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:33,260
Public and private partnerships

2565
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:34,760
I put all the information

2566
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:36,260
A person's information has been collected

2567
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:38,260
wait till it happens

2568
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:40,260
I'll look for it again

2569
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:43,760
This was what I was thinking

2570
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:44,260
is ok

2571
01:40:44,260 --> 01:40:46,260
ok then you record first

2572
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:47,260
words after recording

2573
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:48,260
if you want to use videotape

2574
01:40:48,260 --> 01:40:48,760
sorry

2575
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:50,260
you must have certain

2576
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:51,760
due process

2577
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,260
you can use this

2578
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:54,760
that now now

2579
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:56,760
do we do something like this

2580
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:57,760
This is

2581
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,760
possible concerns

2582
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
when did you my personal information

2583
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,500
collected by someone out of town

2584
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:09,000
Then how is he used

2585
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
announced

2586
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
not very clear

2587
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,500
many people raised their hands

2588
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,000
It can be seen that the reaction is very enthusiastic

2589
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Hello

2590
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,500
Thank you for your brilliant presentation

2591
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:29,000
just ask a question

2592
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Two questions should be asked

2593
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
The first question is

2594
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Why do people need privacy

2595
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
there may be a range of answers

2596
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Then ask the vice president about this question at the same time

2597
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Physician

2598
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I studied law with Mr. Lin

2599
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
I personally think

2600
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
people need privacy

2601
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
on the first list

2602
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
The first is to say

2603
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Privacy Helps Creativity

2604
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
If the individual has no privacy

2605
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
society cannot progress

2606
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
no creativity

2607
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Then I will ask the two teachers to accept

2608
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
The second question is to say

2609
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,840
Living in a situation where all housing and transportation are under surveillance

2610
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:05,380
everything is traceable

2611
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:08,960
In the past we said that the law is not subject to

2612
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:10,760
All can now be mailed to

2613
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:13,320
Essay Questions Sexuality Questions

2614
01:42:13,820 --> 01:42:14,840
can be sent to

2615
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:16,640
age-leading problem

2616
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:17,920
retirement machine problem

2617
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:20,740
So the whole principle of the law is broken

2618
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,040
The whole system logic system is gone

2619
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:24,320
That

2620
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:27,900
For insurance, we have to go out for oil and fill in a lot of insurance information

2621
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:29,440
ID card phone

2622
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:33,240
Then when you see a doctor, you have to log in online

2623
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,820
And when there is a traffic violation, it will be registered on the Internet.

2624
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:39,900
Traffic Hear me sorry

2625
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:41,420
when traffic violation

2626
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:44,240
You can register on the Internet, you know it when you go online

2627
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:47,820
When declaring money to a certain political party or religious group

2628
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:49,100
above all

2629
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:53,460
So as soon as these big data comes out, we will already know the result of the next election.

2630
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:57,040
We live in such an era that everyone has the opportunity to be

2631
01:42:57,300 --> 01:42:58,580
protagonist of a news scandal

2632
01:42:58,580 --> 01:42:59,580
Excuse me

2633
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
just say when something like this happens

2634
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,340
how to protect yourself

2635
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:04,460
Is it procedural justice?

2636
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:05,860
or is there a better way

2637
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:07,360
Thanks

2638
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:09,300
and facebook recognition

2639
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:13,560
Can you tell if a person is homosexual?

2640
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:16,760
Especially in the era when Qiyin is developed

2641
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:17,660
before birth

2642
01:43:17,660 --> 01:43:19,500
We knew this kid was a genius

2643
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:21,660
there are still handicapped people

2644
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:23,660
So we live in a time long gone

2645
01:43:23,660 --> 01:43:24,760
full of challenges

2646
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:26,460
Thanks

2647
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:29,660
You speak

2648
01:43:29,660 --> 01:43:30,920
I speak

2649
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:35,420
I basically don't like living in a society like this

2650
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:40,860
So I was very concerned about privacy a long time ago

2651
01:43:40,860 --> 01:43:42,160
district

2652
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:44,320
very different requirements

2653
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,960
very very go

2654
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:47,520
A Thousand Cups Request

2655
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,520
I just want to give me a space

2656
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:51,220
words in this space

2657
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:53,820
I can be close to someone I choose

2658
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:55,520
partner or friend

2659
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,260
we can have very intimate conversations

2660
01:43:58,260 --> 01:44:00,120
at least in that space

2661
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
In the middle of the space, I'm still alone

2662
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
What about the words in the middle of this space?

2663
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
this my friends

2664
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
he knows what i am

2665
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
So for some existing

2666
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,000
ups and downs they will basically

2667
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
that's how it looks

2668
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
so you are at least alone

2669
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
But living in what you just described

2670
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
this era

2671
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
basically feel very

2672
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
special

2673
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
very strange

2674
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Then everyone can watch that movie too

2675
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
The Truman Show, isn't it?

2676
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
We like to live in the middle of that world

2677
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
But the future is like that

2678
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
what shall we do

2679
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
actually

2680
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
I should tell you one thing

2681
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Wasn't it one of the things I talked about just now?

2682
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
That is to say, we protect the rights of photographers

2683
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
He actually has a saying

2684
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Just afraid of being wronged by others

2685
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
understand

2686
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
twisted by others

2687
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Now what you just said about DNA

2688
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
that's been talking about one thing

2689
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Human DNA is read

2690
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
then what about the enemy

2691
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,360
Even after all the enemies are done

2692
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:03,800
You get another person out again

2693
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:06,160
Is that the original person of that person?

2694
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:07,560
you know this information

2695
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:10,360
You put together all the information on this person

2696
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:12,160
is this the person

2697
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:14,160
Probably not

2698
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:15,560
Therefore, among our society today

2699
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:16,560
kind of missing something

2700
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,560
In fact, we just talked about each other

2701
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:21,960
some degree of respect and trust

2702
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:22,960
is actually important

2703
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:25,000
When you take these basic things

2704
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,360
when everything is knocked out

2705
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:29,560
In fact, what has become of human nature

2706
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:31,720
so that privacy it exists

2707
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:33,720
It's about humanity

2708
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:36,720
Or you say that the earliest start is the instinct of animals

2709
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:39,720
Animals, apart from taking each other's eggs

2710
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:42,720
Others basically still have some degree of one

2711
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:45,720
on a body it will have a

2712
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:47,720
I hope there is still a distance

2713
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:49,720
Human basically except for that distance

2714
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:51,720
What you just said is correct

2715
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,720
Actually some things

2716
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:55,720
very immature

2717
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:57,720
My privacy also protects what I am

2718
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:58,880
I don't need to carry

2719
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,720
That's a bit different from speech

2720
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
kinda about where he is the focus

2721
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
i don't need to tell you

2722
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,000
i have no reason to tell you

2723
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
because it's my privacy

2724
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
That also protects me a lot

2725
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
give me plenty to think about

2726
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
You said you just talked about human knowledge

2727
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Human civilization is actually related to this thing

2728
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
It's important that he has some protection.

2729
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,000
but one thing you just mentioned

2730
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
actually took us to another level of discussion

2731
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
what is human nature

2732
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
What kind of society do we want to pursue?

2733
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
words in the middle of this society

2734
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
how each person is treated

2735
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Actually we make

2736
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
In fact, the reason why this society is like this

2737
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,000
we made

2738
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:40,000
because we like a very safe

2739
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,000
no society in which danger can occur

2740
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
We hope to provide very much

2741
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
a service that we use very much

2742
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
what do we want

2743
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,000
what do we want

2744
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
This is what each of us wants

2745
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
and create a society like ours

2746
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
So what you need to understand is that

2747
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
we demand more and more

2748
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,300
Because of the development of technology, it is actually beyond our

2749
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:05,600
it's beyond our imagination

2750
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,300
growing faster

2751
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:09,200
but i've always been here

2752
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:11,300
Of course, we are doing some technological humanization

2753
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:14,500
I was just thinking about saying that in the middle, we actually need to be more senior.

2754
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:16,300
What about some things?

2755
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:19,100
we should think about it

2756
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:20,300
think about it

2757
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:24,100
So like for example we were doing

2758
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:25,900
When the Human General Project

2759
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:28,900
When the United States was doing the Human General Project

2760
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:31,000
then-leader Watson

2761
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
The Watson that Norgoi talked about

2762
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,400
He basically did one thing by saying

2763
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:38,100
He asked for 3% to 5% of those doing research

2764
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:42,600
Take it out and do Elsie Ethic

2765
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:44,800
Legal and Social Impact

2766
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:45,800
a study

2767
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:47,100
i think he is important

2768
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:48,500
we are now

2769
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:49,700
Actually, we don't want to talk about this anymore.

2770
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:52,400
Let's talk about AI first

2771
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:53,800
AI development

2772
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:56,400
You immediately see the development of AI

2773
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:58,000
amazing, isn't it

2774
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,900
The AI ​​is also pretty amazing

2775
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
What if his development continues

2776
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:05,800
words at this time

2777
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,800
This is what we keep saying we can control

2778
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:10,200
is that true

2779
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:14,100
I think this is what we all have in common

2780
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:15,700
common mission

2781
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:17,900
honestly no solution

2782
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:21,500
We give young people a chance to speak

2783
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:22,900
Gai, are you starting?

2784
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:23,900
good

2785
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:25,400
that

2786
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:26,900
Hello President Lin

2787
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:28,200
Then what I also want to ask is

2788
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:29,700
Because of the recent EU

2789
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:31,900
It should have been last year or the year before the EU

2790
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:34,900
through a so-called right of memorandum judgment

2791
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:36,400
The true meaning of this judgment

2792
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,900
I think the main thing is to say

2793
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,400
When personal film and television rights and freedom of speech rights

2794
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:41,900
when a collision occurs

2795
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:42,900
the court of the European Union

2796
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:44,900
He chose to use his personal film and television rights

2797
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:46,900
there is a more important part

2798
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:47,900
so he said

2799
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:48,900
he just said

2800
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:49,900
he just said

2801
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:51,900
He said that with personal film and television rights

2802
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:53,900
there is a more important part

2803
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:54,900
i want to ask

2804
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:55,900
that

2805
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:57,900
The professor's or director's view on this matter

2806
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:58,900
right

2807
01:48:58,900 --> 01:48:59,900
Thanks

2808
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,200
In fact, there is still a lot of research that can be done.

2809
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:03,800
But basically it's like this

2810
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:06,040
I'll start with a basic response that says

2811
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:09,120
He wants to become concrete and feasible

2812
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:10,480
yes still need to spend

2813
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,840
He actually has to be a little more detailed

2814
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,040
Of course you know the right to be forgotten

2815
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:16,240
if the experiment

2816
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:18,760
What price do we pay for this

2817
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:23,000
When the judgment was first

2818
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:23,920
some people just say

2819
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:25,520
Well, the history of mankind will

2820
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:27,960
there will be no history

2821
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:29,640
because everyone can

2822
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:30,720
forgotten

2823
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:33,400
The history of mankind is basically

2824
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:34,680
everyone's behavior

2825
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:35,520
He said

2826
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:37,760
this constructed

2827
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:39,280
As a result, each piece was removed

2828
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:40,440
Take this piece off this piece

2829
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:41,680
so you can see the right to be forgotten

2830
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:43,080
There must be many exceptions behind him

2831
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:44,880
he must have many exceptions

2832
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,200
including what you just mentioned

2833
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:47,440
free speech part

2834
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:48,560
he will have an exception

2835
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:50,320
but where is that specific thing

2836
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:51,600
this stuff needs to be talked about

2837
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:54,440
Then from my legal point of view

2838
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:55,560
when you come to see this

2839
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:56,960
I think there is an American scholar

2840
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:58,120
he speaks very well

2841
01:49:58,120 --> 01:49:59,600
He said we really need

2842
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,260
not the right to be forgotten

2843
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:03,100
but should be

2844
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:04,900
the right to be forgiven

2845
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:06,960
not forget but forgiven

2846
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:09,000
everyone should know

2847
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,200
you and i can both make mistakes

2848
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:13,160
Everyone should have second chance

2849
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,100
Will we hold on to this one

2850
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:20,400
You and I have empathy over there

2851
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:22,060
Then look at such a thing

2852
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:23,600
that might

2853
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:25,100
would maybe

2854
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:26,360
we are not sure

2855
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:28,500
But what he said about the right to be forgotten

2856
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:29,800
Behind him is actually everyone else

2857
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:30,560
you can watch

2858
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:32,260
because you can watch another thing

2859
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:33,500
is behind some

2860
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:35,060
political economy issues

2861
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:37,900
This is what the EU ruled

2862
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:39,700
Canada then

2863
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:40,760
that's american

2864
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:42,100
company

2865
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:43,860
behind him he has many other

2866
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:44,860
can be discussed

2867
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:46,860
But he is a very important question

2868
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,060
he is a very problem

2869
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:52,560
Me you wish I had a yes no or something

2870
01:50:56,660 --> 01:50:59,500
The gentleman in the back, he goes to the back

2871
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Hello Professor Lin

2872
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Well, actually, thank you very much for your wonderful speech just now.

2873
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,000
right from your speech

2874
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
You will know that in fact the development of technology

2875
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Including AI, including IoT, including BDIR

2876
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
These actually come from all over the world

2877
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Here, if you look at both sides

2878
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
On the one hand, this force of privacy infringement

2879
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,000
It's like what I just said

2880
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
we wish good luck

2881
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,000
But that is actually the current technology

2882
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:37,000
This is the strength of our Protect Private side

2883
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Obviously asymmetrical

2884
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
or this part of our effort

2885
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Asymmetrical on both sides

2886
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Here is actually already

2887
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I don't know what will happen in the future

2888
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
invasion of privacy

2889
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,000
So sometimes I think a lot

2890
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,000
then more helpless

2891
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Then the more afraid

2892
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
the one who just mentioned to you

2893
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
There are many of these in our country

2894
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
This Ethical or this Effort of Private C

2895
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Maybe a few Percent or not even a few Percent

2896
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Effort is not big enough so I don't know how to say this two

2897
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Several levels and one level means from the perspective of the country

2898
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,000
In addition, from the perspective of dealing with these large enterprises

2899
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,000
And what do we personally want from Sebastian's perspective?

2900
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Maybe it means that the situation develops like this

2901
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Sometimes the more you understand, the more helpless you will be

2902
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
It's happening so I don't know what we should do

2903
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Look at this matter with a more positive attitude

2904
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
thanks for this difficult question

2905
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,000
There is another saying that goes like this

2906
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Everyone is a real villain

2907
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,000
It means that I have something to hide

2908
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I am like this, but you are also like this

2909
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,000
The Song and Ming Dynasties just mentioned

2910
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
That is our predecessor Wang Fuyuan

2911
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
At that time, I asked him about film and television rights.

2912
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,000
He told me a few things

2913
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,040
be the first to talk about this

2914
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,080
He said that the husband of the Song Dynasty

2915
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:06,040
Basically think that there is nothing to hide

2916
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:07,240
other than that

2917
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:09,400
He also told me about the May 4th Movement

2918
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:11,680
the words of these workers

2919
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:14,240
Just like Hu's leaders

2920
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,840
Basically they are exchanging diaries

2921
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:18,340
The exchange of diaries is to let you know

2922
01:53:18,340 --> 01:53:20,040
what am i doing what are you doing

2923
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:22,840
Everyone has one like that

2924
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:24,800
A case of interior

2925
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:26,680
Well, on the other hand?

2926
01:53:26,680 --> 01:53:28,540
I found that when he was talking to me about this

2927
01:53:28,540 --> 01:53:30,280
I just wanted to say oops

2928
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:32,780
At that time my daughter was in primary school

2929
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:34,880
They also exchange diaries

2930
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:36,380
Then you can see today

2931
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:39,280
I don't use Facebook yet

2932
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:41,180
But all my friends around me are using Facebook

2933
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:42,880
All my friends are on facebook

2934
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:43,880
Under such circumstances

2935
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:46,040
you'll think it's ok

2936
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:50,080
Is it a change of mind?

2937
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:53,280
Because we may the environment in which we grow

2938
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:54,780
because we grew up in that

2939
01:53:54,780 --> 01:53:57,380
The era of authoritarian regimes

2940
01:53:57,420 --> 01:53:58,780
So for our individual

2941
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:00,120
personal privacy

2942
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,120
is very caring

2943
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:02,580
but us

2944
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:03,720
I'm like Pew my daughter

2945
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:04,580
words of their generation

2946
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:06,460
they live in a happy

2947
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:08,920
Looks like a happy time

2948
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:10,420
So basically speaking

2949
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:11,380
like

2950
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:13,160
nothing

2951
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:14,460
nothing

2952
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:15,580
Then on the other hand

2953
01:54:15,580 --> 01:54:16,820
Is it real

2954
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:18,660
Notions of privacy change

2955
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:21,500
I used to think I didn't want to give you

2956
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:24,120
The current concept has become called Sharing

2957
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:26,420
like this one on facebook

2958
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:27,800
the founder

2959
01:54:28,220 --> 01:54:30,420
Zuber was in 2002

2960
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:31,600
Note that it is 2002

2961
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:32,600
he just said

2962
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:34,220
actually

2963
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:36,160
I just mentioned that because

2964
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:38,760
Behind Privacy, he is actually related to Social Know

2965
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:41,920
He said that the current Social Know has changed

2966
01:54:42,120 --> 01:54:42,920
So what?

2967
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:45,160
Don't talk to me about Privacy anymore

2968
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:46,800
Because now Social Know has changed

2969
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,520
so stop talking about this

2970
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:50,020
As a result he was in 2002

2971
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:50,860
he was pushing

2972
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:53,660
That Facebook is pushing a new Privacy Policy

2973
01:54:53,860 --> 01:54:54,960
The result is immediately

2974
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:55,920
slap in the face

2975
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:56,800
Immediately changed again

2976
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,960
But what he said later was actually

2977
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,720
is worth saying

2978
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:04,000
Is it true that Social norms have changed

2979
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:06,720
What we cared about in the past is what we care about now

2980
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:08,480
its new generation it may

2981
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:09,560
it feels nothing

2982
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:13,320
It feels like nothing needs to be like this

2983
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:16,120
But in the end, of course, there is a question of

2984
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:18,520
no matter how you look

2985
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:20,200
can have so many friends

2986
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:21,280
and then there are so many

2987
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:23,600
So much information that can be exchanged with friends

2988
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:24,600
then the last words

2989
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:26,120
do you keep a little bit

2990
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:27,800
I don't want others to know

2991
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:28,960
I'm quite curious

2992
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:30,960
We also need to pass

2993
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,760
Maybe big data

2994
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:34,600
should be through the fact

2995
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:37,360
Some empirical research should be done

2996
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,960
Really do some empirical research

2997
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:40,480
what can we dare say

2998
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:42,480
Then what we just talked about are some

2999
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,160
Relatively general

3000
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,760
Everyone seems to think it's something like this

3001
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:47,760
a concept

3002
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:49,960
So has a concept changed?

3003
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,120
On the other hand, of course

3004
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:53,960
there is another possibility

3005
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:54,960
i've been thinking about this

3006
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:56,600
That means you like, say, Facebook

3007
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:57,560
you are so old

3008
01:55:57,560 --> 01:55:58,760
it is already transnational

3009
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:00,080
what else can you do

3010
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Of course one thing we want to do is say

3011
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,000
We have seen them in order to compete

3012
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:09,000
So their words they will take this seriously

3013
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
User consumer

3014
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,000
So find a way to keep the market open to competition

3015
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Basically, the other side of technology we see is

3016
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
He is soon to be as big as he is today

3017
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
He will be gone tomorrow, right?

3018
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
he is like this sometimes

3019
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,000
But what we're more worried about is where the information goes.

3020
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
It's not the problem that you didn't introduce that information.

3021
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
but that information

3022
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,000
That information may be like this, he has always existed, right?

3023
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
That's what we just mentioned

3024
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:39,000
That question of Right to be, to forget, forgotten

3025
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
The words in that place are information

3026
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,000
because at any time and forever he always exists

3027
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,000
We hope he doesn't exist, don't act like this

3028
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Then we have to think about it now

3029
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
very practical question

3030
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,000
What kind of time did these things happen?

3031
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
don't be so scared

3032
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
You don't have to be so fearful

3033
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Then I'll be melancholy over there every day

3034
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,460
what happened

3035
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:03,660
That's what we have to know after

3036
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:05,200
we can find a solution

3037
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:09,160
But the problem is we don't know what's going on right now

3038
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:12,960
that's the trouble

3039
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:15,600
So what I said just now is to say

3040
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:17,660
Everyone worked hard to find a way to get him out

3041
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:19,800
Because of this time constraint

3042
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:21,960
I want to ask a few people to answer together

3043
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:24,560
Then you stay until 12 o'clock in the evening

3044
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:26,000
The rest is to discuss with him

3045
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,160
You can go up front and discuss with him

3046
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:32,320
Just this one, these three, okay?

3047
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:35,120
You all asked together and you answered together

3048
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:40,520
Wait a minute, you can ask the second person and the third person

3049
01:57:44,860 --> 01:57:47,520
Sorry, that teacher just mentioned that

3050
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,120
This is the age of the Internet of Things

3051
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:50,960
Because of the Internet of Things era

3052
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:52,320
we know he collects

3053
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:54,320
The information is quite comprehensive

3054
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:56,320
But look at this in our country

3055
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:58,880
personal protection law

3056
01:57:58,880 --> 01:57:59,680
he actually still

3057
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,620
Is it possible to identify individuals

3058
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:04,500
Then fine no longer go to authorize the competent authority

3059
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:07,660
Do some enumerated behaviors to determine whether it is an asset

3060
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:10,420
But in the era when the teacher just mentioned the Internet of Things

3061
01:58:11,060 --> 01:58:13,540
With the data you collected so comprehensive,

3062
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:16,060
data set

3063
01:58:16,780 --> 01:58:18,900
Use it to de-identify a person

3064
01:58:18,940 --> 01:58:22,180
Then I was thinking about this part. I don’t know if I can ask the teacher for advice.

3065
01:58:22,700 --> 01:58:26,580
Is there a more suitable way

3066
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:31,980
To confirm what level of information is considered a qualification

3067
01:58:32,380 --> 01:58:35,780
Or make it a more

3068
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:39,180
It is more in line with a definition like this used in practice

3069
01:58:39,700 --> 01:58:41,380
Ask the teacher this question, thank you

3070
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:53,860
Hello Professor Lin

3071
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:59,780
I want to go along with the concept of privacy you just said

3072
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,500
Let's talk about this place

3073
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:03,900
Because I listened to tonight's lecture and felt

3074
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:07,800
Your right to privacy in the context of the current information society

3075
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:10,200
There is a deep worry about being violated

3076
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:12,700
There is also a pessimistic mood

3077
01:59:12,700 --> 01:59:14,100
what about me

3078
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:17,400
Think about it from another perspective

3079
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:18,200
because

3080
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:24,300
I think maybe the concept of privacy may indeed undergo some changes under the background of this information

3081
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:29,200
Then I would like to propose the concepts of absolute privacy, relative privacy and bottom-line privacy

3082
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:31,400
because the bottom line is

3083
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:32,700
because

3084
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:35,000
I think in this context of information

3085
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,300
we enjoyed the message

3086
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:39,600
as a resource or a

3087
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:42,500
a convenience of exchange

3088
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:46,800
We don't just see a privacy violation

3089
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,100
harm to person or personality

3090
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:50,400
at the same time

3091
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,800
have some rights

3092
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:55,800
There are some private rights before the public interest

3093
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:57,900
Is it necessary to release

3094
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:59,700
just for personal sake

3095
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,120
in the public interest or for the benefit of others

3096
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:06,320
He may want to release some of his personal space and private information

3097
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:08,680
For example, as a public figure or political figure

3098
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:10,560
we have a right to know about him

3099
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:15,360
In addition, how should the so-called reporting and supervision rights be divided?

3100
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:19,120
Yeah, I thought maybe those powers needed to be protected.

3101
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:24,520
It's just that when balancing the various powers

3102
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:26,800
When the law is established

3103
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:29,000
how to set a rule or boundary

3104
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,280
This may be something we need to think about

3105
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:32,840
you are studying law

3106
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:34,840
Yes, Thanks

3107
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:39,640
and that little girl

3108
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:45,400
hello professor

3109
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:47,000
what i want to ask is

3110
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,440
just during the speech

3111
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:52,800
You will hear that the development of science and technology

3112
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:57,440
is that they actually depend on some of the privacy that we the people provide

3113
02:00:57,440 --> 02:01:00,280
It feels like our right to privacy has nothing to do with the development of modern technology

3114
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,600
is a bit like interdependence

3115
02:01:02,600 --> 02:01:04,400
Then there is also the concept of interlocking

3116
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:06,000
Then what I want to ask is

3117
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,800
just in technological progress

3118
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:10,700
That moment when we still need our privacy

3119
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:13,300
It just feels a little bit about our power

3120
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:15,300
There is a feeling of conflict

3121
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:18,700
Then what I want to ask is this kind of public welfare part

3122
02:01:18,700 --> 02:01:20,600
It is a technological advancement

3123
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:21,900
with human rights

3124
02:01:21,900 --> 02:01:24,800
between our own privacy

3125
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:28,000
That's how to measure the legitimacy

3126
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,900
yes thank you

3127
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:31,800
I just came back to say

3128
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:33,300
i'm not totally pessimistic

3129
02:01:33,300 --> 02:01:35,800
I just meant to mention

3130
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:39,500
A free flow of information is very important

3131
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:43,100
the free flow of information

3132
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:45,100
Of course including his free collection

3133
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:47,500
So I will answer from the back first

3134
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:48,300
that is

3135
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:50,700
In this part I just mentioned a suggestion

3136
02:01:50,700 --> 02:01:51,600
in fact it is

3137
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:54,400
make it public for debate

3138
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:56,400
in the final analysis

3139
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:57,800
what about today

3140
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:00,200
These data relate to personal data

3141
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Or related to personal film and television materials

3142
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,600
why is it so important

3143
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:08,700
Need to become technology development

3144
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:12,300
or a necessity for its development

3145
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:13,900
let everyone understand

3146
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:15,100
If so

3147
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:18,000
Maybe we can make a comparison

3148
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,700
We all know the situation and do something very understanding

3149
02:02:20,700 --> 02:02:22,400
Now we don't know

3150
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:24,700
is a possibly abstract statement

3151
02:02:24,700 --> 02:02:26,000
Of course we understand that

3152
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,000
the more the merrier

3153
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,800
how much is that

3154
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,400
to what extent

3155
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:32,200
I just started talking

3156
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:33,400
I just need to identify

3157
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:35,700
Then start to get a little bit out of touch with the individual

3158
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:37,100
you use that data

3159
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:38,300
but sometimes

3160
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:40,900
it needs that identifying information

3161
02:02:40,900 --> 02:02:42,000
So this middle word

3162
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,600
Trade-offs are up for debate

3163
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:47,500
i think it should be

3164
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:50,600
After IoT comes out, basically

3165
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:52,400
In fact, the current difficulty is like this

3166
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:54,400
That is to say, I feel that the Personal Data Protection Act

3167
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:56,800
It has to face a new problem which is to say

3168
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:58,300
you thought you meant

3169
02:02:58,300 --> 02:03:00,300
identify

3170
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
that thing that is identifiable enough

3171
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
The so-called teaching profile

3172
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Now if we look at it with our current technology

3173
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Almost every piece of information is sufficient to identify

3174
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Insufficient recognition today becomes sufficient recognition tomorrow

3175
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
So how do you face such a problem?

3176
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
I think our current personal data protection law

3177
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
his words in many places

3178
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,000
He hasn't put a question like this

3179
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:25,000
He brought into his normative thinking

3180
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:28,000
So I think he's thinking about this part of the question

3181
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
It should be like what I just mentioned

3182
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
should be opened

3183
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Let's discuss and debate

3184
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
What should be like is a reasonable

3185
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,000
As I said just now, it is not one-sided

3186
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
he should be a balanced

3187
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,000
he should be a balanced

3188
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
We want to give people a certain degree of space

3189
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
as mentioned earlier

3190
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
may be an underlying

3191
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
look at the words you use, sorry

3192
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,000
The word you use is the bottom line is the bottom line

3193
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
That's what I don't exchange with you

3194
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Other words depend on your personal status

3195
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
or comtest

3196
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
maybe he's somehow

3197
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,600
is required may be can be collected

3198
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:04,000
can be revealed

3199
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,160
so it is true

3200
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:06,600
So to resist the contest

3201
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:07,920
I think it is to resist the contest

3202
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:09,800
That's basically true in Taiwan

3203
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:11,920
some people basically

3204
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:14,120
He enjoys less

3205
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:15,360
some people have more

3206
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:17,600
But of course this is not the case now

3207
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:19,200
What we are talking about today is his general

3208
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:23,760
He basically wants more information

3209
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:25,600
more information

3210
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:28,160
is better

3211
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:32,400
Because I'm not an expert on this

3212
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:33,960
so i thought it meant

3213
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:36,960
need to talk

3214
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,200
And then this dialogue

3215
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:43,320
comparative intellectual circles

3216
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:44,920
probably general public

3217
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:46,400
let's get to know

3218
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:48,320
because we talk a lot about

3219
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:50,120
The final decision is yours

3220
02:04:50,120 --> 02:04:51,600
may affect everyone

3221
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:53,120
so he needs to be like this

3222
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:55,800
I think I'm not that pessimistic

3223
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:56,800
i just feel like saying

3224
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:58,560
If this kind of development continues

3225
02:04:58,560 --> 02:04:59,960
at least we need to know

3226
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,720
This is after I made a choice

3227
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:04,520
I made a choice

3228
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:07,800
if there is no answer

3229
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:09,400
Those three come back later

3230
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:10,300
let's go on

3231
02:05:10,300 --> 02:05:12,960
I think because the time has come

3232
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:16,860
Then I think before officially announcing the end

3233
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:19,860
I have one more thing to announce

3234
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:22,500
this is the trailer

3235
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:23,700
this is a teaser

3236
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:29,500
First on October 17th in October 106

3237
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Center for Academic Activities at Southport at the Midshore Institute

3238
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:38,200
The first meeting on the second floor of the Zhonghe Research Institute is

3239
02:05:38,900 --> 02:05:40,600
The same feast of knowledge

3240
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:44,960
We have an Earth Science Institute

3241
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:46,860
Researcher Xu Yaru

3242
02:05:47,300 --> 02:05:50,800
The lecture will be based on the Great Earthquake of the Last Era

3243
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:51,800
take the tsunami

3244
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:53,060
Frequent earthquakes recently

3245
02:05:53,300 --> 02:05:56,600
So you may also be interested in this topic

3246
02:05:57,300 --> 02:05:59,760
Well I think we see you today

3247
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:04,600
Interacting with this teacher Lin so enthusiastically

3248
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:08,900
Then said that this speech resonated a lot

3249
02:06:09,100 --> 02:06:11,500
i think wait there may be a little time

3250
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:15,500
Let everyone who is intrepid can ask him for advice

3251
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:18,800
Then let's applaud now and thank Team Leader Lin

3252
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:20,400
thank you thank you thank you

3253
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:21,800
thank you all thank you
