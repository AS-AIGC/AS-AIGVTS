00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,780
COLLEGE

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
COLLEGE

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
COLLEGE

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
COLLEGE

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
COLLEGE

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
COLLEGE

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,260
this is a test

8
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,900
Our topic today is

9
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,440
I'll see later

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,440
It's Taipei Metropolis vs. Pompeii

11
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,500
Then we invited to this court

12
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,140
Researcher Lin Zhengxiong of the Institute of Earth Sciences

13
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,840
Come give us a special presentation

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,140
I think everyone has heard of Pompeii

15
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,080
its an ancient city in italy

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,780
more than 2000 years ago

17
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,780
because of a volcanic eruption

18
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,480
So it was a very prosperous ancient city

19
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,620
It's gone all night

20
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,220
Then we associate it with Taipei

21
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,280
It’s because it’s actually next to Taipei City

22
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,620
there is a volcano

23
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,520
This is our special presentation today

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,480
I'm here to tell you about this

25
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,520
Our Datun Mountain is actually a volcano

26
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,960
so today's speech

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,060
Let's wait for Researcher Lin to explain

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,500
How do we determine that our Tatun volcano is a volcanic volcano

29
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,700
Observations using our SeismicNet

30
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,500
To prove the existence of the magma reservoir under the Tatun Volcanic Group

31
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,000
Then we cover how to use technology to work

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,500
The early warning data provided by these volcanic eruptions

33
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,000
then do some analysis

34
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,000
and then be able to know that

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Fire volcano next to our volcano

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
what is its current condition

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We want to be able to coexist with volcanoes

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
These are very important things

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The whole of Taipei is next to the volcano

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
so i want to introduce

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
our speakers today

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Researcher Lin Zhenghong

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000

Researcher and Deputy Director

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Also National Taiwan University

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Professor of Peace in the Department of Geological Sciences

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He is now in the Ministry of Science and Technology

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Director of the Tatun Volcanic Observatory

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and the Executive Yuan Central Disaster

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
member of fire prevention committee

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Researcher Lin's research focus

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The focus of the past five years

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
including the use of Taiwan's very intensive

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Earthquake Observation Network

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's talk about volcanoes

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Two important sciences and landslides

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Issues related to disaster prevention

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
For seismic data

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
innovative applications

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So it will develop landslide monitoring

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
principles and methods

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Others have a big contribution

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It is the building of the Tatun Volcano

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
His research has been awarded twice by the Ministry of Science and Technology

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
or former National Science Council Distinguished Research Award

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It is also the year of the Geophysical Society of the Republic of China

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Geophysical Contribution Award

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and many other earth science studies

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Related Young Food Paper Awards

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So he brings a very interesting topic today

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We also have quite a few guests here today

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Come on, everyone is very interested in this issue

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm wasting too much time

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let us welcome Researcher Lin Zhenghou with warm applause

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Vice President Ye

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Thank you for your participation

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
hot summer weather

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Everyone also made a special trip here, very touched

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
that mainly i think

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Of course, you may be interested in this topic

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
is we put

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Laser Jam

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
anyway good

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
that's mainly this

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
How can we in Taipei follow

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Pompeii linked together

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's actually this

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
especially in recent years

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We do a lot of work on the mainland site

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
of course

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This world happens to have

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Pompeii film in 2014 also

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
played

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So the whole world is especially Taiwanese

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
special

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Notice

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
In fact, for such a topic,

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
many of my colleagues

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
or some friends say

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
My topic is too sensational

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
so

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You give this title

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
just want it

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to trick everyone

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Actually this topic is not

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I shouldn't have given it to you

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
conversely

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Because I did work for the mainland website

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,560
So I went to many places regardless of assisting in speeches

113
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,840
or popular science speech

114
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,440
In fact, after each speech

115
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,840
Mostly people will come to me and ask

116
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,280
Will Taipei become Pompeii?

117
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,240
So this is what a lot of people care about

118
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,640
then i hope today this

119
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,480
This is more than an hour of these materials

120
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,800
After sharing with you

121
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,560
I think everyone will have the answer

122
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,680
This very clear answer must be presented

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,680
especially in recent months

124
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,840
Last one or two years

125
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,680
we'll start with this

126
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,480
At the end of last year, the Lihua Institute

127
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,240
Turn the volcanic disaster into Taiwan's

128
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,080
like earthquake typhoon

129
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,720
This natural disaster like flooding

130
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,560
add volcanic disaster

131
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,280
But everyone knows this is a new thing

132
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,680
the past was never

133
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,880
That's because the Lihua Institute passed this amendment

134
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,920
Therefore, the Executive Yuan and local governments have many

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,200
related action

136
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,600
especially taipei

137
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,800
Taipei at the end of March this year

138
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,700
Volcanic disasters that are also drills

139
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,000
especially for

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,400
These Beitou under the Yangming Mountain

141
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,300
The inhabitants of Tianmu

142
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,200
let them know in case of volcanic activity

143
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,700
It should be dealt with by the Shenbai District

144
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,700
because in human history

145
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,100
Taiwan does not have volcanic disasters

146
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,700
Around us, the Philippines, Japan, Indonesia

147
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,600
In fact, there are volcanic disasters at both ends of the three days

148
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,200
Their people and the government have more ideas

149
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,600
how to face him

150
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,700
But Taiwan is really strange

151
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,400
So hopefully we're not ashamed of the volcanic disaster

152
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,200
have more understanding

153
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,700
especially in recent months

154
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,800
This midnight volcano in Hawaii

155
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,300
This Longyinliu is on the road

156
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,600
Everyone knows Longyinliu

157
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,300
It's very hot and very scary

158
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,500
Anything that touches it is completely destroyed.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,820
If you go to Google and read a lot of reports like this

160
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,500
Whether it's a direct lava flow or some breathing

161
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,620
Or poisonous gas, there are actually a lot of them.

162
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,620
In fact, here I would like to point out the following

163
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,940
This time, the eruption of this volcano

164
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,500
Caused a 6.9 earthquake

165
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:29,300
Well, this is actually something that the scientific community or many people are curious about.

166
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,900
Do volcanoes cause earthquakes?

167
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,900
Then Hawaii not only had a volcanic eruption in 1975

168
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,100
Also triggered a larger 7.1 earthquake

169
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,500
So what's the point of this?

170
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,400
In fact, if you are interested in earth science or Taiwan

171
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,800
If there are some concepts of these geology in northern Taiwan

172
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,800
In fact, it will be associated with saying that there is something next to the volcano on the mainland

173
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,500
We're actually pretty much the triangular fault that seismologists worry about

174
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,900
Then some people talked about whether the volcanic activity would cause

175
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,400
Triangular Fault Activity

176
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,100
Evaluation of Triangular Faults by Experts and Scholars

177
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,200
If his entire triangular fault shifts

178
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,300
The earthquake that is likely to be triggered is probably around 6.5 or 6.6

179
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,100
Although not very big compared with this

180
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,000
But he is on the edge of Taipei city

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,900
Well, according to some assessments made by the National Earthquake Engineering Center

182
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,900
If the triangle fault is active

183
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,700
Thousands of houses in Taipei may collapse

184
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,100
Of course thousands of lives were lost

185
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,400
it's a potential threat

186
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,900
so of course this is extra

187
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,900
It's the relationship between volcanoes and earthquakes.

188
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,000
volcanoes cause earthquakes

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,500
Earthquakes trigger volcanoes

190
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,300
but not necessarily

191
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,400
it's a matter of chance

192
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,100
in some cases there will be

193
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,700
Fire and rain in May

194
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,000
volcanic activity

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,100
June 2

196
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,100
Gualimara, Central and South America

197
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,100
This is also the scene of the volcano

198
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,900
There can be these lava flows, debris flows

199
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,100
you

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,600
Look at Xia Haorui's volcanic eruption

201
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
from the past few decades

202
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,600
hardly a single life was lost

203
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
But relatively Central and South America

204
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Look at this a volcanic eruption

205
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
dozens of people died

206
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,100
hundreds of people missing

207
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Most of that believed to be missing

208
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Roughly equal to the number of deaths

209
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,600
then you can see

210
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,100
This Central and South American and Xia Haorui

211
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,600
why is there such a big difference

212
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
In addition to the difference in volcanic characteristics

213
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
actually very important very important what is

214
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,800
this

215
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,500
Xia Haorui has done a lot of work

216
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,200
Japan has done a lot

217
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,700
Volcanoes like Japan are often erupting

218
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,700
But the threat to human life

219
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,700
really very few

220
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,700
that's like this

221
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,700
June is the middle of last June

222
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,200
Yindao volcano is erupting

223
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,700
that dragon smoke

224
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Because Yindao is across the sea

225
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,700
so to this

226
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,700
In fact, this city has no direct

227
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,700
Dragon Smoke, The Threat of the Cracked Hole

228
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,800
But volcanic ash is actually causing a lot of trouble, too.

229
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,900
Then this Bali, Indonesian Bali

230
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,900
This is also the last volcanic activity at the end of June

231
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,900
Then some single things that cause the crowds of tourists

232
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,900
Well, I'm actually going to tell a little story about this.

233
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,400
It's the end of June this year

234
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,400
In fact, Agong Volcano was in October last year

235
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,700
If everyone has the impression

236
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,400
He also sprayed once

237
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:34,100
Then this was two months before the eruption of Agong Volcano

238
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,100
One day I arrived at the office at eight o'clock in the morning

239
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,900
I got a call from this certain reporter.

240
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,000
radio reporter

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,300
he called

242
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,400
Hello, Mr. Lin, I'm Momo reporter

243
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,300
so and so

244
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,500
Actually I can't remember

245
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,200
Well, it's really because of too many reporters.

246
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Then I said yes I remembered

247
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,400
He said let me ask you a question

248
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
I said I thought there was another news

249
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:54,900
he said no

250
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,000
it's a personal accident

251
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,600
The reason is that he is going to Paris Island

252
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
he wants to celebrate his birthday

253
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
25 or something

254
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,500
Just invited a few friends to go to Paris Island to play

255
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,280
As a result, when he was going

256
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,740
Paris Island announced that

257
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,540
The volcano begins to stir

258
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,540
Then he called me and asked me if I wanted to go

259
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,920
then i will talk to him

260
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,720
This Indonesian survey

261
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,680
Because I don't have the data

262
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,580
I don't understand very clearly

263
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,160
but i told him

264
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
if you are not in such a hurry

265
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,920
you may wait a little while

266
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,200
After Indonesia or the official announcement

267
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,360
then you have to judge

268
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,400
Then he probably listened to me

269
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,120
After two months

270
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,560
another morning

271
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,160
he just called

272
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,660
I am a reporter from Mongolia

273
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,920
He said sorry I am now

274
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,920
Chung Cheng Airport

275
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,320
then the night before

276
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,620
that waited for two months

277
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,200
The volcano has finally erupted to the surface

278
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,460
He said, should I go?

279
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,920
really two months

280
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,060
I said you are amazing

281
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,960
you can really count the votes

282
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,660
It was just when the volcano erupted.

283
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,860
Then I told him that you might go

284
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,160
Maybe there will be a delay at the airport like this

285
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,160
But because the eruption of the Grand Agong volcano is the same as

286
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,900
This Paris Island tourist place is about 60 kilometers away

287
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,200
Maybe the volcano will have some impact on the airport

288
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,100
But at least your life is safe

289
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
should have no scruples

290
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,400
so he went

291
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,900
so what does this represent

292
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,400
In fact, the volcano does not come instantly

293
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,700
unlike an earthquake

294
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,800
We can't predict earthquakes yet.

295
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,400
when will you come

296
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,900
no one can tell

297
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,600
But volcanoes basically

298
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,700
Just like the Japanese and American

299
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,600
or these Indonesian islands of Paris

300
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,400
they make some audience

301
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
In fact, I can warn you

302
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,800
He started to move purely

303
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
you may have to prepare

304
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,800
or do something

305
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,400
So overall

306
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,000
In fact, the simplest way is to say

307
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You may well imagine that

308
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,100
this is our taipei

309
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,900
this is 101

310
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This is a photo I took when I climbed to the top of the Jiuwu Peak

311
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Then I put the ancient city of Pompeii and cover it with seven seven seven three

312
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
will that be the case

313
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's something that many people imagine

314
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
then we want to talk today

315
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Pompeii and Taipei, or this, this, Dalun and Vesvi volcanoes

316
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
do some comparisons what is the same and what is the difference

317
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Then we'll know what happens to him

318
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So according to this very simple introduction, I will divide it into six parts to tell you about it.

319
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The first one is of course nothing more than introducing the relationship between Pompeii and Vesvi to everyone.

320
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We all know each other well

321
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Maybe some people are a little blurry

322
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Let us now briefly introduce the space-time background

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
let everyone know a little bit

324
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And the main part is when the volcano erupts

325
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Why did the entire city of Pompeii be submerged?

326
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,560
What kind of disaster, let's introduce it by the way

327
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,840
Then the second is

328
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,640
Taipei and Datong volcanoes

329
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,900
Just now the vice president also said

330
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,440
He is a volcano

331
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,040
In fact, this is what we have done in the past 10 years

332
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,640
Some like-minded friends in the academic circles

333
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,440
Results from different observations

334
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,000
Looks like he's a volcano

335
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,800
that especially myself for this

336
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,640
The work of the magma chamber is actually

337
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,940
took me a lot of time

338
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,000
Sometimes I'm embarrassed to speak in private

339
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,840
In ancient times, I heard people say

340
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,300
It's a ten-year grind

341
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,300
I have that deep feeling

342
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,900
I spent more than ten years

343
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,200
Finally, do some questions that you want to answer

344
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,040
find some answers

345
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,380
The fourth part is

346
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,140
TVO stands for Datong Volcano and Mountain

347
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,880
Although volcanic

348
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,340
and threatening

349
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,900
But it's not such a scary thing

350
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,800
as long as we are ready

351
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,900
That preparation is actually based on scientific monitoring

352
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,840
Scientific knowledge can actually provide us with many coping methods

353
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,580
that fifth part is fun

354
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,580
This is not for fun

355
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,080
for me personally

356
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,420
I studied ninth subject ninth science

357
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,580
And it specializes in the study of earthquakes.

358
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,420
When I saw the place name of this volcano and the heartbeat of the volcano

359
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,260
I'm really a detective

360
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,460
That heartbeat like a volcano

361
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,460
I believe no one in the world has seen

362
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,300
when i first saw

363
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,620
I don't think there is such a thing

364
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,620
I will report to you later

365
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,460
Finally, a summary and discussion

366
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,740
So I took advantage of this explanation with everyone's doctrine

367
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,780
Let's talk about Pompeii and Mount Vesve first

368
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,380
this is the italian peninsula

369
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:48,180
Rome, and south of it is the ancient city of Pompeii

370
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,140
Next to the ancient city is the volcano of Weiswei

371
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,580
that feeling is

372
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:59,460
When the Roman Empire was very powerful

373
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,640
good in every way

374
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:10,600
In fact, there are many achievements or VIPs.

375
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,800
very simple VIP

376
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,400
It will be next to the ancient city here

377
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,800
to buy a villa

378
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,400
just come here for vacation

379
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,800
why come here for vacation

380
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,600
Actually, it's like this all over the world.

381
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,400
The volcano is the most beautiful

382
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,100
like tokyo in japan

383
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,100
everybody knows

384
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,500
Mount Fuji next to it is also about 60 kilometers away

385
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,700
That's the spirit of the Japanese

386
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,300
Or fly to an impossible place

387
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,200
that's actually like

388
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,700
I will bring it back to Taipei

389
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,500
Where will the rich people in Taipei be

390
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,700
You have to be able to afford some mansions

391
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,700
Because there are mountains and water

392
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,500
just beautiful

393
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,700
so like the whole world

394
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,100
as long as there are volcanoes

395
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,000
basically just pretty

396
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
that is

397
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's a place that makes you feel comfortable

398
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,340
but of course it has its threats

399
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,080
2000 years ago

400
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,180
The science of course is almost zero

401
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,140
So they didn't think of these things

402
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,740
So the ancient city next to it was built here.

403
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,180
If you have the opportunity to go now

404
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,320
or have the opportunity to

405
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,120
This is Vizvi

406
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,860
This is the current appearance of the ancient city

407
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,620
After everyone is excavated

408
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,660
The rest becomes a very

409
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,860
A museum that many people visit

410
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,380
or attractions

411
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,880
Then of course the result of this is

412
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,380
When Vizvi volcano erupted

413
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,840
Think of this as the plot of the movie

414
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,740
Just cover the entire ancient city next to it.

415
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,020
Then review these relevant knowledge

416
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,860
This Vizvi and the ancient city next to it

417
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,800
In fact, the ancient city next to Vizwe is to the south of it.

418
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,500
About 10 kilometers away

419
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,800
That Huihui's representative said

420
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
When the volcano erupted, the volcanic ash covered the entire area.

421
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So when it erupted in 2000, it was covered with 6 meters of volcanic ash

422
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
In fact, nothing is gone

423
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
At that time, the survey said that there were about 20,000 people living in Gai Gai

424
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And with particular emphasis on holiday villas

425
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Everyone is very leisurely in the process of vacationing there

426
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It wasn't until the 16th century when the canal was opened that the ancient wall was discovered.

427
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But in the 18th century

428
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The king for these ancient artistic incentives

429
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So he spent a lot of money to put this street in Pompey

430
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
A lot of antiquities, just dig it out

431
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's why people know

432
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
This used to be a very large city

433
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Although only 20,000

434
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
But you can imagine 20,000 before 2000

435
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
that was very lively

436
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
a city

437
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Then they dug this

438
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You see, the streets are very well planned

439
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
futures-worthy

440
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
and especially this

441
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
This is above the house of a giant merchant

442
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
The money will be written on the ground

443
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
this welcome money

444
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Welcome

445
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It means they are extravagant

446
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
In fact, if you go to Google to find this document

447
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
There are many, many criticisms

448
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It was the Romans at that time

449
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
life of luxury or a lot of negative

450
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
delay is in it

451
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Then of course the last

452
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
They don't know the money is waiting for you

453
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But the volcano is there too

454
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
In fact, two sides of the same body

455
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Then why did this happen in the end?

456
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
This is what we want to convey to you

457
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What kind of threat does the volcano pose to me?

458
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Then this is the original

459
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
These residents were instantly overwhelmed by high temperature

460
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
volcano

461
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,960
When the volcano will also be buried

462
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,000
In fact, your bone and flesh tissue is

463
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,800
disappeared in an instant

464
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,400
but your body

465
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,500
become hollow

466
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
So this is because they poured plaster into it.

467
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,200
look like people at that time

468
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,500
bailed it out

469
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
why is that so

470
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,700
In fact, I want to introduce to you

471
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,200
this pyroclastic flow

472
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,000
this

473
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,100
this is real

474
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,600
Because Pompeii in the 2000s has

475
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,200
I can't prove it

476
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,600
But volcanic activity

477
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,400
Actually

478
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,200
always have

479
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,100
different places

480
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,200
debris flow

481
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,800
what do you look like in this photo

482
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,600
super like this

483
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,100
Sand Leopard

484
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,600
Anyway, it's just a cloud of ashes.

485
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
so you can't see

486
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,500
shiplike

487
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,200
But this is totally different from the Dust Leopard

488
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,500
Sand Leopard

489
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
look

490
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,400
this is very fast

491
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,840
100 kilometers per hour 200 kilometers per hour

492
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,400
Then this is very hot

493
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,000
hundreds of degrees of high temperature

494
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,200
It means you can't escape

495
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,700
if you are touched by it

496
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,800
actually probably

497
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,200
Just like the inhabitants of the valley of Pompeii

498
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,640
almost identical

499
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,240
so you see this

500
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,200
this

501
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,500
There are these villages and houses on the hillside

502
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,160
actually

503
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,640
you can imagine this

504
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,160
In fact, there will be nothing left

505
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,640
Pompeii Valley

506
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,080
exactly the same result

507
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,280
That

508
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,680
you are all real

509
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,000
this is the philippines

510
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,140
brand apple

511
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,780
when the volcano erupts

512
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,800
you can see right

513
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,880
in the lower left corner there is a

514
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,480
a little truck

515
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,880
see this stream

516
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:46,980
certainly

517
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
run if you can

518
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,980
hop in the car if you can

519
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,980
run fast

520
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,240
But like I just said

521
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,580
Can these people escape?

522
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,280
basically can't run away

523
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,120
Because the flow velocity of the broken hole is higher than

524
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,400
All road cars are faster

525
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,200
What's more, this is a path in the field

526
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,140
that same year

527
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,140
This silver circle volcano in Japan

528
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,900
You can Google this

529
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,740
you can see this video

530
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,980
He is here, the car is here

531
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,340
Run when you see the tax stream

532
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,080
Then the tax stream keeps coming and going.

533
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,280
Then the screen goes black

534
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
Then why do you see

535
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,680
Later, they took the camera out of him

536
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,680
Since that record is still

537
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,680
he played it back

538
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,680
Then restore it to the process at that time

539
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,680
So the tax and interest flow is actually for the volcanic disaster

540
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
it's number one

541
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,680
it's inevitable

542
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,680
And you see it probably can't escape

543
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,680
it's very very scary

544
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Then why is there a tax stream

545
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,680
This has a very simple cartoon explanation diagram

546
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,680
Because when the magma keeps coming up from the crater

547
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,680
That's a thousand-degree high-temperature thing

548
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
when coming up vertically

549
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,680
after here it starts

550
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,600
It's going to cool down a bit, but it's still a few hundred degrees left

551
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,200
But he starts off kind of turning into something solid

552
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,300
It's turning into stone energy

553
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,100
Slowly feel a little cold

554
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,600
Then but when he keeps piling up

555
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,800
because of gravity

556
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,900
he will run to him at last

557
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,200
So when he accumulates a lot

558
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,600
when running to him for a moment

559
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,100
debris flow

560
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,100
Underneath are small rocks or these

561
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
large and small stones

562
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,400
volcanic ash

563
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,700
then the whole thing comes down

564
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,300
So this is the one that threatens the most

565
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,300
Then what I just said

566
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,500
because it is high temperature

567
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,300
so you see this just come down

568
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,100
At this moment, the whole house burns down

569
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,200
which one is the most

570
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,500
most modern

571
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,700
And the best example is

572
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,200
Ginsen Volcano in Japan

573
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,300
This is the eruption of this Yinxian volcano

574
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,300
Then this is the Shimahara room

575
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,700
at the foot of the mountain

576
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,400
And then this debris flow comes from this hilltop

577
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,100
Just go down the whole valley

578
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,900
what happened

579
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,000
something like this

580
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
This is, the debris will come down along this ancient land

581
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
This lower digging is like a river

582
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Mainly these crushed stones

583
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
will walk along this low ancient land

584
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
but here it takes a twist

585
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
turn these stones

586
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's heavier, just go this way

587
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
but what does this arrow represent

588
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's just ash, a lighter substance

589
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
moshali it didn't touch the ground

590
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
it goes straight from here

591
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
just rush over

592
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Then rush over here is the village

593
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
There is a primary school in the village

594
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
we look at this elementary school

595
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
what happened

596
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
This is this crumb coming from here

597
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
so we are

598
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Debris is coming from the back of this classroom

599
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Of course you can see the glass

600
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Everything is owned by that crumb

601
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Those ashes broke it apart

602
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Whole

603
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But if you look at the other side

604
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
This is Li Doors and Windows

605
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,240
You can imagine how high that temperature is

606
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,680
That is the temperature of hundreds of degrees of volcanic ash

607
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:13,880
When it came over in an instant, the entire door and window of Li, which was resistant to a considerable temperature, was deformed.

608
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,840
So if you imagine that this thing is very hot, the doors and windows are all deformed.

609
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,120
Then you can imagine people or all these houses

610
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,600
Ordinary traditional wood or houses burn instantly

611
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,840
In fact, Yingquan Volcano is in history

612
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,240
In fact, it is a very, very painful lesson for Japan.

613
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,520
this 1792

614
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,560
Fifteen thousand deaths from this

615
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,360
why hundreds of years ago

616
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:49,760
This is actually one of these natural disasters worthy of our world

617
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,360
This model of understanding

618
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,560
what's going on

619
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,160
when a volcano erupts

620
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,600
Just like the eruption of the Xiahaoyi volcano just now triggered a

621
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
about seven earthquakes

622
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
then the earthquake

623
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,200
Of course, we can imagine the damage caused by the earthquake.

624
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,560
even more frightening

625
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,480
It put this silver inlaid on the other side there was originally a hill

626
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,680
knocked it all down

627
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,800
It just slides into the sea

628
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,200
If it slips into the sea, it will generate a tsunami

629
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,080
So this typical compound disaster

630
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,160
It's a volcanic earthquake and a tsunami

631
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,200
The real 15,000 people may exceed 10,000

632
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,280
They all died from the impact of this tsunami

633
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,920
Then this is the silver inlaid volcano in Kyushu

634
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,680
it's here

635
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,400
So you see after this landslide falls into the sea

636
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,240
In fact, the seaside villages around the entire Inland Sea

637
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,920
All residents suffer

638
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,000
That's why there are so many mountain tiles

639
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,600
So the Fowles disaster is now more familiar to everyone.

640
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,480
Like Japan's Three World Wars and One Earthquake

641
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:53,800
right

642
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,960
everybody knows

643
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:55,760
earthquake

644
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:56,880
tsunami

645
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,920
river disaster

646
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,080
The river disaster may actually be

647
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,440
In fact, it is more endless than earthquakes and tsunamis.

648
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,680
So this event from the very beginning

649
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,960
but triggered to the end

650
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,160
In fact, the most serious is the last

651
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,480
So this loaded disaster

652
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,760
In fact, for what we are talking about now

653
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,360
This disaster prevention is very important

654
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,880
if i know soon

655
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,080
what happened to this

656
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,120
I have time to avoid subsequent actions

657
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,240
or some disaster

658
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,680
So the loading hazard is

659
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,520
you are now the whole world for

660
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,640
A very important concept of disaster prevention

661
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,840
OK, then say the same

662
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,360
this of course hasn't happened yet

663
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,680
This is what many American advanced European scientists worry about

664
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,240
This is Africa This is North America South America

665
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,200
That's here on the west coast of Africa

666
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,440
there is a volcanic island

667
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,800
The volcanic island is the same

668
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
When they worry about a volcanic eruption

669
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,160
volcanic island will collapse

670
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,480
or these terrific terrains

671
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,240
As long as it collapses, there will be a tsunami

672
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,520
that scientist

673
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,360
It's okay to do some simulations

674
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,080
but

675
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,560
It's scary look at these numbers

676
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,560
it's 132 meters

677
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,840
which city or 132 if we

678
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,640
132 meters, we may all soak in the sea here

679
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,940
inside sea water

680
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,960
That

681
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,400
Although in the west of Africa

682
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,840
But New York, Boston or many cities on the East Coast of the United States

683
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,040
As long as this tsunami comes

684
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,680
This is really out of hand

685
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,320
It is a great threat to human beings and the United States

686
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,640
Will this be an auspicious question?

687
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,320
None of us can tell now

688
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,000
But what day does a real volcanic activity turn into a disaster caused by a tsunami

689
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,760
auspicious

690
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,560
is a question worth thinking about

691
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,680
That

692
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,360
Although in Africa, every week seems to have nothing to do with us

693
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,560
Then I take this opportunity to point out that

694
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
Everyone knows that Guishan Island

695
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,960
We didn't talk about Guishan Island today

696
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,280
But Guishan Island is

697
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,480
Taiwan's outside of Big Butt Volcano

698
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,840
volcanic activity volcanic island

699
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,560
Guishan Island

700
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,060
if

701
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,160
If you haven't been there, you can see that these terrains are very steep

702
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:09,500
If a volcanic event took this piece it arrayed it

703
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,340
This is of course a simulation like this

704
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,340
It also creates waves or tsunamis

705
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,240
In particular, our Yilan Plain is actually very flat, right?

706
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,700
A wave of 5 meters in the Yilan Plain may be a tsunami

707
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,540
Maybe the beach is the same

708
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:29,040
If it is 10 meters, there is no need for 1.3 Yilan to be soaked in water

709
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,680
Of course we don't want this to happen

710
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,680
But things in nature are not about whether we like it or not

711
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,680
that we have to be prepared

712
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,680
Can't wait until we wish it didn't happen

713
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,180
ok , so let ' s go back to this volcanic disaster

714
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,980
The downdrafts I just told you about are the scariest.

715
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,480
That longan stream is like this shrimp fish

716
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,980
The longan stream seems to be very hot, but it's not terrible

717
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,980
There is one that is actually very slow

718
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,480
you see it , you run probably past it

719
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
so longan flow

720
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,740
The damage is relatively limited.

721
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,620
In addition, the earthquake we just talked about has also been mentioned.

722
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,120
We're talking about volcanic ash and mudflows

723
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,520
special volcanic ash

724
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,860
The flowing dragons we just talked about are all at close range

725
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,900
it's only dangerous if you touch it

726
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,960
But volcanic ash is not

727
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,020
it can go far

728
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,100
cause you a lot of trouble

729
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,600
This was also last month

730
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,480
Yindao volcano erupts again

731
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,880
Luer Island

732
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,240
This is Yindao

733
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,080
This is Luer Island City

734
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,360
About Luer Island

735
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,560
No more than about 500,000 people

736
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,560
small city

737
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,720
this volcanic ash

738
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,960
Yin Island is hyperactive

739
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,160
I go to Yindao

740
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,360
No more than 5 to 10 times

741
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,560
I don't remember either

742
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,240
but about twice

743
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,040
one time you will encounter volcanic ash

744
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,440
I have a high memory

745
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,680
often just go and see

746
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,480
That volcanic ash is like a chimney in Asia

747
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
This Kagoshima city is like this

748
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
This is either the sea or the volcanic ash

749
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So Kagoshima city is very used to

750
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
This volcanic ash lives with them

751
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Mount Aso two years ago

752
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Just these cars in the whole neighboring city

753
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
all covered

754
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Of course it just makes your life very inconvenient

755
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It will not pose a great threat to your life and property

756
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
That's a small volcanic eruption

757
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
But volcanoes have big eruptions and small eruptions

758
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Like the Pinnatus in the Philippines that erupted here 900 million years ago

759
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
This is where Manila is located

760
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Pingna Tutu is in its northwest

761
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
This volcano has actually been in the past ten or twenty years

762
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Already a relatively large volcano

763
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
what effect it has

764
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
But this volcano is very lucky

765
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
why lucky

766
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Because the United States has a so-called this in the Philippines

767
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,440
This Air Force GT is the Clark Air Force GT

768
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
They were two weeks before the eruption

769
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,640
Because the USGS in the United States helped with the investigation

770
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,560
because of the problems with their F-16 fighter jets

771
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,400
So they found out they couldn't do it.

772
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,160
This volcano should erupt within 10 days

773
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,880
All Clark Air Force GT F-16's are scrapped

774
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,400
only this one left

775
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,680
This is a broken plane

776
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,680
it can't run so keep it

777
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,680
So a lot of volcanoes were built

778
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,280
This is a very successful example of a very successful volcano monitoring

779
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,680
That is of course the result of the cooperation between the United States and the Philippines

780
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,680
then look at this

781
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,080
This though with these volcanoes at close range will

782
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,080
But this volcano will not only

783
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,080
nearby will affect

784
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,080
You see this is the one before the eruption

785
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,080
tens of kilometers of this

786
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,480
Six layers of these ash

787
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
When it erupts in June, the whole thing turns red

788
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
The volcanic ash floats to very, very high altitudes

789
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Then you see it's July, August

790
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It was only in December that it slowly returned to its original position.

791
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So for about half a year, the entire volcanic ash floated high above the earth.

792
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Although this is a relatively large volcano this year

793
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But if a large volcanic eruption like geological time

794
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
could cover the entire atmosphere of the entire earth

795
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
the sun does not come in

796
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Life on Earth may even become extinct

797
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
This is history

798
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
That's what the historical evidence says

799
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
The extinction of some organisms may actually be related to volcanoes

800
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Large volcanic eruptions are closely related

801
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Then in 2010 this Icelandic volcano

802
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Maybe everyone has the impression

803
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,800
The entire volcano will float to the continent of Europe

804
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,200
All flights across continental Europe are suspended

805
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,000
What about the whole passenger or the economy?

806
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,600
They assess a whole bunch of losses

807
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,200
Then this is a bigger volcano

808
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,300
In fact, it's not just the effect of close range.

809
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,200
In fact, all human beings will be affected

810
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,800
Let's see how much it erupts

811
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,900
Probably the biggest volcano is this one

812
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,400
This is the United States on the address

813
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,500
they have three different colors

814
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,700
That's 2.2 million years

815
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,700
1.3 million years

816
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,600
640,000 years

817
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,500
Area covered by three eruptions of different ages

818
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,900
This geologist does career research

819
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,100
outlined

820
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,300
So there's a super nutrition store under Yellowstone Park

821
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,600
This also has a movie in production

822
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,900
is also very sensational or very scary

823
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,680
So the United States actually treats this civil servant of the Huang family very, very seriously.

824
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,680
Why?

825
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:15,040
Of course, if you divide 2.2 by 3, it will come once every 700,000 years.

826
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,840
So the last time it was 640,000 seems to be coming soon

827
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,640
If round by cycle

828
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:29,960
If it is true, it means that they seem to be about to erupt in the tenth time in the tenth time

829
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,640
This is the result of a supervolcano

830
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,840
Volcanic ash certainly has a big impact

831
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,840
Let's go back to this lahar

832
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,560
This is a volcanic mudflow in Colombia and the Americas

833
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,560
What is a volcanic mudflow?

834
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,640
Everyone knows that we have landslides in Taiwan

835
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,920
It's just water, mud or he just flows down

836
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,400
It's even scarier at the volcano

837
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,400
volcanic ash is lighter

838
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,800
so it is easier to flow

839
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,040
And the ash in the volcanic area

840
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,240
So as soon as you touch the sea, the whole mudslide will come

841
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,640
Especially in these high mountains in Central America

842
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:14,320
usually like jade mountain or this

843
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,920
or higher these mountains

844
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,880
it is covered with snow

845
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,880
But once the volcano came up,

846
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,560
It's just a high temperature and ice and snow

847
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,760
Touch some of that snow and it will melt

848
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,520
produce a lot of water

849
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,480
Then the water brings down the ash

850
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,360
The whole shock

851
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,120
There are tens of thousands of people at every turn

852
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,760
gone

853
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,520
This is because it is far away from us in Central America

854
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,400
But in fact, the transmission of information

855
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,560
if you look carefully

856
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,600
This is five years or ten years

857
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,920
There is such a big disaster that will come out

858
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,120
The mud flow is like this the whole

859
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,400
this

860
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,000
Landslides in the South before Typhoon August 8

861
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,640
In fact, after blocking these rivers,

862
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,160
Then the water goes to the village to flood

863
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,120
This is the moment of volcanic eruption

864
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,920
Just now we thought that ash lahars

865
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,400
Volcanic ash lava flow Water system flow

866
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,840
This is an instant disaster

867
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,160
But this mudslide

868
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,040
this is endless

869
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,200
Why

870
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,880
just a typhoon

871
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,880
When the water comes, it will bring a mud flow

872
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,600
especially the philippines

873
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,440
Philippines at every turn

874
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,480
as long as a typhoon comes

875
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,360
Of course Taiwan is also often affected by typhoons

876
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,520
big threat

877
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,120
But like the brand car next to me

878
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,880
That is the volcanic fan has been carrying

879
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,960
poison the river

880
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,560
Then the flood called the whole

881
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,120
to many villages

882
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,400
that may be 30 years

883
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,120
I can't take that volcanic fan away

884
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,920
that has always been

885
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,640
repeat these menacing things

886
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,120
Well, the Vesvi and Pompeii

887
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,440
Or Volcano brings an introduction

888
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,440
we'll go right back to

889
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,960
Our Taipei and Chancellor Hill

890
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,400
Of course this is imaginary

891
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,400
This is our 101 Dalun Volcano in Taipei Basin

892
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,000
If the Great Looming Volcano erupted

893
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,600
If these lava flows, crater flows, or lahars

894
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,800
Anyway, after the advanced stage, they may all go to the Taipei Basin

895
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,400
Then if these lava flows block the mouth of Guandu

896
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,000
Danshui and Keelung can't get out

897
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,200
Will there be this legendary Kangxi Taipei Lake?

898
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,200
won't run out

899
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,200
This is a possibility as long as it happens

900
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,600
In fact, I really hope to compare 101 with Qixing Mountain at this distance.

901
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,800
Seven Star Mountain is the area we think is most likely to be active

902
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,000
Well, it's actually less than 15 kilometers

903
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,600
is a very very short distance

904
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,000
Very short straight line distance

905
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,200
You can imagine this volcano will come up

906
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,800
The whole of Taipei is probably similar to that one

907
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,400
The guided one has almost the same impact on the city next to it

908
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Then we also do a little bit of simulation

909
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
This is assuming that there is a volcanic eruption in Qixing Mountain

910
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
What will happen to Longweiliu

911
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
This is the simulated location

912
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Then you give me a little closer look

913
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
The different colors are its thickness

914
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
or its area of ​​influence

915
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Don't look carefully at this

916
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
because you will see where my home is

917
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
In fact, I have always

918
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I made it about four or five years ago

919
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I have never dared to show off

920
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Until recently because of volcanic eruptions it has been

921
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Legislated

922
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
when the government has to face

923
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So this is just for reference

924
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
that's for

925
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
If Huangzuishan

926
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
This is the bottom and this is the golden mountain

927
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
just to the north

928
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
We know Jinshan is very capable

929
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
In fact, many people are very concerned

930
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Will it affect the very energy field?

931
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I don't comment on this

932
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
just do a little mock work

933
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Of course it will affect the range

934
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It all depends on the amount it erupts

935
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,200
If the eruption is a little bit smaller, it will certainly affect a small area

936
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,500
If the eruption volume is large

937
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,200
It certainly has a large reach

938
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,400
that eruption is small

939
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,900
now we don't know

940
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,900
but i'll tell you later

941
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,200
if it erupts next month

942
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
I have a very high chance

943
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,300
will tell everyone

944
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,800
Will the eruption be big or small

945
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,200
This is based on some scientific estimates

946
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,300
Well, then this volcanic ash is also what everyone often talks about.

947
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,500
This is some simulations done with the help of Mr. Wang Guowei from CUHK

948
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,200
In fact, he did it 365 days a year

949
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,500
Different directions according to different seasons

950
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,400
when the volcano comes up

951
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,300
how it should float

952
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,300
Then of course we have 365 days of data and we are running

953
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm here only spring and autumn

954
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,100
Of course spring, summer, autumn and winter are different

955
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:55,800
Every day actually has something to do with the direction of the wind

956
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,200
This is from our TVO 6 years ago

957
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,980
We just want to say that if the volcano erupts that day

958
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,160
How should a volcano spread?

959
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,080
Just go to Japan, and spread in the direction of Hainan Island.

960
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,280
This is an impression

961
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,720
Just tell these phenomena

962
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,680
Okay, we talked for a long time, actually.

963
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,240
This is what I've always wanted to say if if if

964
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,880
if the volcano erupts if the volcano erupts

965
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,400
But the real question is whether continental volcanoes will ever erupt

966
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,680
So that's back to our serious scientific question

967
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,680
That is, we have been around for about ten years

968
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,680
A group of people trying to find the answer

969
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,680
before finding the answer

970
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,280
When I was a student or earth science person

971
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,280
If you read it, you can probably know

972
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,680
This is our topographic map of Taipei

973
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,680
The red area is the fire dust rock

974
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,180
Fire dust rocks represent the volcanic eruption

975
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,680
lava on the surface

976
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,180
igneous rock body

977
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,180
So this is probably like this

978
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,580
That's because in Taiwan we don't have

979
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,480
There is no record of volcanic eruptions in history

980
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,980
So most people want to say

981
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,300
Volcanic eruption, Taiwan does not do our business

982
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,340
Taipei will never

983
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,660
But according to geologists, the stones in these red areas

984
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,660
do some dating

985
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,900
The so-called dating is to find out the age of its eruption

986
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,900
Was it 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago, or 1,000,000 years ago?

987
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,420
They can do it based on that parity year

988
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,220
Do the comparison and get the result

989
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:25,740
This is an old picture from the 1980s

990
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,620
That could have had a little eruption about a million years ago

991
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,620
By 800,000 years

992
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:35,620
Volcanoes began to emerge from the Chancellor Volcano

993
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,620
then 400,000 years more

994
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:40,620
Then came this 100,000 years

995
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:43,620
feel like stopped

996
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,620
So because the data is provided until 100,000 years

997
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,620
There is no data for 0.1 million years

998
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,620
So there is no eruption in history

999
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,620
This geological researcher told us that it seems to be gone in 100,000 years.

1000
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,620
So for a long, long time in the past

1001
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,620
Minister Volcano

1002
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,200
Or Yang Mingzhang National Park is for fun

1003
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,200
he's not threatening to me

1004
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,480
But about ten years of work

1005
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,840
If we go to mainland volcanoes to see

1006
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,520
This is a surface fumarole hot spring, right?

1007
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,440
This is a typical volcanic area

1008
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,080
Especially this geochemical analysis

1009
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,240
This is the work done by the professors raised by the National Taiwan University

1010
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,960
He is still equal to the pioneer

1011
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,200
He did some of these chemical analyzes of the fumaroles

1012
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,440
just tell us

1013
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,400
That thing is not a feature of the surface

1014
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,560
but what

1015
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,960
If you step deep into the earth, you will come slowly

1016
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,800
That's Teacher Yang Canran

1017
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,360
met me once and said

1018
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,080
Geochemistry

1019
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,040
Chemically it looks like it's alive

1020
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,120
But no one does physics

1021
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,760
so he advised me to do it

1022
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,520
At that time, I just returned from a one-year visit to Japan.

1023
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,080
Saw a lot of volcanoes in Japan

1024
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,600
I gladly jumped in and did it

1025
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,640
Then I jumped in and now I can't come back

1026
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,280
more and more miracles

1027
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,600
Then anyway, I will cast the Earthquake King

1028
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,200
so i watched a lot

1029
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,480
There are many, many earthquakes in Daren Mountain

1030
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,080
Then in these earthquakes

1031
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,040
What particularly attracts me is

1032
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,440
There are quite

1033
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,640
This volcanic earthquake can be seen

1034
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,360
The traditional one is an earthquake on a general fault

1035
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,440
Its appearance is similar to that of volcanoes and earthquakes

1036
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,320
Its physical properties are completely different

1037
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,080
He has a person and he introduces several

1038
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,520
Then like this air-built radar

1039
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,720
see the crater burst

1040
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,880
it's all new

1041
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,160
The rep said he wasn't weathered

1042
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,360
didn't get overshadowed by the 10th

1043
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,920
mean he's new

1044
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,840
Then level the vehicle

1045
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,120
it's a japanese one

1046
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,040
one of my uncles

1047
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,120
sit with me

1048
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,440
There may be a drop in the platform when it is found

1049
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,200
It means he seems to be moving

1050
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,240
rather than stable

1051
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,800
Then this dating

1052
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,040
Especially the last one is the most important

1053
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,920
This is what we used to reason about

1054
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,400
Chen Zonghua Deputy Director

1055
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,800
he found russia

1056
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,120
found a german

1057
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,240
I found it because Russia

1058
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,500
Then there are quite a lot of volcanoes

1059
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,200
Then comes the year of the Volcano Society

1060
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,840
Because we don't have good experts in this field

1061
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,940
So I invite these foreign scholars to help

1062
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,100
He set out about 5000 to 6000 years

1063
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,940
Anyway, he made a mistake.

1064
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,140
But whether it's 5000 or 6000

1065
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,980
This means very high. What does it mean?

1066
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,680
In the neighboring country in 99 years

1067
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,020
We will open one at the Geological Survey

1068
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,320
Conference of experts and scholars

1069
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,020
Then we talked about Taitai Volcano for a long time

1070
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:33,480
Although there are very strong disputes in the middle

1071
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,080
Some people say Yes and No

1072
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,920
But the final conclusion is that

1073
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,720
general volcano

1074
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,220
Extinct volcanoes or volcanic volcanoes after the whole world

1075
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,860
The result of our last discussion on Taitai Volcano

1076
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,060
It's a dormant volcano

1077
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,160
What is a dormant volcano

1078
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,200
it is a volcano

1079
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,100
but it's sleeping now

1080
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,940
someday you won't wake up

1081
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,180
What is the name of this volcano that appeared?

1082
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,340
like Xia Haoyi

1083
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,960
You can go to see that magma anytime

1084
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,960
Or go to Aso Volcano

1085
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,200
it's smoking

1086
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,060
boot smoke

1087
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,900
This is the volcano that appeared

1088
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,660
So the big round volcano is alive

1089
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,300
It's just that it doesn't look active right now

1090
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,900
Then with this result

1091
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,960
So this is the definition of volcanology, which means

1092
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,460
Active in ten thousand years

1093
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,160
you have this record

1094
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,060
I classify it as a volcano

1095
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,560
just have a bad record

1096
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,000
special management

1097
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,460
pay attention to it

1098
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,060
This is the experience above

1099
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,360
But the phenomenon is

1100
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,960
I personally feel the phenomenon

1101
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,500
maybe it has more scientific significance

1102
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,060
That is, if you can confirm that there is a magma chamber

1103
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,100
like yellowstone park

1104
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,160
the scientist said

1105
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,160
There is a big magma chamber underneath

1106
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,300
of course it's alive

1107
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,300
If Yellowstone Park just talked about

1108
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,160
last eruption

1109
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,760
The main eruption is 640,000 years old

1110
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,360
This is ten thousand years old

1111
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,000
That should be ten volcanic

1112
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,460
But Yellowstone can't use rules of thumb

1113
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,160
law of phenomena

1114
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,920
It's the magma chamber that you found

1115
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
live without meaning

1116
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
This is a general definition of something like

1117
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
So the process is

1118
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
In fact, for the past five or six years

1119
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Every time because I do Daheng Volcano

1120
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Tell the Ministry of Science and Technology that this is a volcano

1121
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Looks like I'm a volcano

1122
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
At that time, the natural Sisi of the Ministry of Science and Technology

1123
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Chen Yigao is also the 17th student of National Taiwan University

1124
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
we are still mature

1125
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
every time i meet you i say

1126
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Where did you say the volcanic magma chamber is?

1127
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
When you meet me, ask me where the magma chamber is

1128
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I was asked by him for five or six years

1129
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I actually want to talk more

1130
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
In fact, I probably have a spectrum how to do it

1131
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
but no evidence

1132
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Then I came up with a very simple concept

1133
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Just use the shadow of the magma chamber

1134
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
The concept of this shadow is very simple

1135
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
we see the shadow of this plane

1136
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
We don't need to look up to know

1137
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
there is a plane in the sky

1138
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Because the sun hits the plane

1139
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Can't penetrate the plane

1140
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
There is a shadow on the surface

1141
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,480
it's clear

1142
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,240
The X-ray in medicine is the same for everyone

1143
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,920
This X-ray hits the bones and tissues

1144
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,480
Because the absorption is different

1145
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,600
So if the finger breaks off

1146
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,040
see the crack

1147
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,360
So this is because of the X-ray test

1148
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,360
difference between tissue and bone

1149
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,160
Then earth science actually started more than 100 years ago

1150
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,640
There is such a concept that

1151
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,440
when the earthquake happened

1152
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,440
Earth science has long known that

1153
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,200
This external combination is AutoCore

1154
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,680
it is a liquid

1155
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,280
This is 2900 kilometers from the surface to the outside

1156
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,520
is a very, very deep distance

1157
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,960
But why do scientists know it's a liquid

1158
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,880
It is based on the shadow of the S wave

1159
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,160
Seismic waves hit the red part

1160
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,160
you can see in this section

1161
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,080
From this S wave signal

1162
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:57,400
but you're on the brown side of the back

1163
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,200
You can't find a straight S wave

1164
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,760
It was blocked by OtherCode

1165
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,160
It's just a liquid substance, it can't go through it.

1166
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,800
S waves can't penetrate

1167
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,760
Then maybe it's easier to tell you

1168
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,100
That is to say, this is the P wave

1169
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,600
Whenever there is an earthquake

1170
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,800
Anyway, elastic waves will produce P and S

1171
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,800
This is a heavy or compression wave

1172
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,560
it's a bump

1173
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,800
Look at this black

1174
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,400
it shrinks and then stretches

1175
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,160
It's like hitting a pool ball

1176
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,960
So the energy is transferred in one

1177
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,160
What is the S wave

1178
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,560
S waves are like snakes

1179
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,560
it just twists and shears

1180
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,160
So one is a linear motion

1181
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,060
a sideways twist

1182
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,160
Then this is of course simpler

1183
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,160
for simplicity

1184
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,960
That is to say, if the left side is a solid

1185
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,360
on the right is a liquid

1186
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,160
What is the difference between solid and liquid

1187
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,400
solid is this

1188
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,160
Between each molecule and the powder molecule

1189
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,260
caught by chemical pieces caught well

1190
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,960
it can't run around

1191
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,700
It means you're on my left and you're on the left

1192
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,760
you can't run to the right

1193
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,960
but what about liquid

1194
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,440
You can run with liquid

1195
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,440
is liquid or gas

1196
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,560
Meaning it doesn't have these brown sugars

1197
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,560
see you grab

1198
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:15,360
So what do these two different behaviors cause?

1199
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,360
P4 If you turn around from this side by external force

1200
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,640
it will

1201
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,640
it will be like this

1202
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,600
and then this

1203
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,240
this shape this

1204
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,760
So P4 will transfer energy

1205
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,760
Then you when this one comes running

1206
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,320
This S wave because it has sugar yellow

1207
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,680
it will pull over and the sugar yellow will elongate

1208
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,280
so this will bring

1209
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,440
then take one by one

1210
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,280
So the S wave will pass like this

1211
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,240
So when solid

1212
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,760
Both P and S pass

1213
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,280
but when liquid

1214
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,240
P4 can pass

1215
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,960
S wave because these two don't have any

1216
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,040
that relationship

1217
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,120
so

1218
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,520
This hole this one won't move

1219
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,520
Take a very simple ratio

1220
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,600
everyone sit here

1221
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,360
if we hold hands

1222
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,440
is solid

1223
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,760
when one of them leans back

1224
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,120
The one next to it will also treat it

1225
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
so it will pull one by one

1226
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
So this is the characteristic of S wave

1227
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
If we don't hold hands, it will be liquid

1228
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
one of them lay forward

1229
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Lie forward, the one next to it won't be dried

1230
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
is a property of solid liquids

1231
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Based on this, we can test that

1232
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Is there any liquid or solid in the earth?

1233
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
this just

1234
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Okay, so we imagine that

1235
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Except for Otocore, the earth is external and liquid

1236
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
kernel

1237
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Not this magma chamber

1238
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
It should be that the magma with high temperature is liquid

1239
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
So I was thinking that S wave will definitely disappear after hitting this point, right?

1240
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Okay, then I have deployed a lot of seismographs here in Yangmingshan.

1241
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Then take advantage of the very deep bottom

1242
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
We have many large and deep earthquakes off the coast of Yilan

1243
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
and then straight up from the bottom

1244
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
then hit our area

1245
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Then I'll check

1246
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:10,000
You will see the blue seismic stations all can see the S-Bow

1247
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
The only thing is that the red area cannot see S-Bow

1248
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Of course, P-Bow and S-Bow look a bit professional

1249
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
but it's not that hard

1250
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I put the red and blue records on the next one

1251
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Here's where P-Bow arrives

1252
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Then the S-Bow arrives like it's clear

1253
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
But when the seismic waves hit the magma chamber

1254
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
P-Bow is penetrable

1255
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
S-Bow can't find it at all

1256
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
It just disappears, disappears, and there is a shadow

1257
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So this diagram says

1258
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
S-Bow disappeared when hitting the magma chamber

1259
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
S-Bow runs out when you miss it

1260
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
According to this is very simple, we will draw a cartoon picture

1261
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
The magma chamber is here. If you hit yellow, this side station

1262
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
If you can't see it, you're blocked

1263
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,800
If this is true, we also repeat the verification that

1264
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:08,700
If the magma is fixed here, the S wave cannot pass through it, but what about the P wave and the heavy wave,

1265
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,800
Heavy waves, solids and liquids are all fine, they can penetrate all of them,

1266
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,800
Although it can penetrate, but it will slow down,

1267
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,500
Because it is liquid, it will go slower,

1268
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,400
So I will walk here together as the side,

1269
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,200
These two it only goes so far,

1270
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:27,500
This is a group of four, but it is very clear that we see the earthquake hit here,

1271
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,400
We got a signal on the surface,

1272
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,000
Then this is a simulation, if you hit the magma, it will slow down here,

1273
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,500
Then the S wave disappears, and the right hand side is our observation,

1274
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,800
That is, the wave that does not hit the magma solid will follow the distance,

1275
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,200
Arrive here at the appearance of probably black,

1276
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,200
But once the magma is solidified, it will not be here, it is a little slower,

1277
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,400
So when you look at the S wave, you can’t see it, and then the P wave is similar again,

1278
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,500
To me, this is the space of no doubt,

1279
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,200
There is a liquid substance under the ground,

1280
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,600
It is said that the liquid substance is, um, what is missing is magma, it is water,

1281
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,900
That's impossible,

1282
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,340
Why? At 20 km the water will be squeezed out

1283
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,840
Because the density of magma is closer to that of rock

1284
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,340
it can be retained so it can't be water

1285
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,240
So of course magma is the best and only explanation

1286
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,240
Then its size is about

1287
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,440
GOO la 70 square kilometers

1288
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,840
How big is 70 square kilometers

1289
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,140
It's its area

1290
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:26,180
About a quarter of the size of the administrative district of Taipei City

1291
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:27,580
let everyone be grateful

1292
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,920
A little bigger than Siling District, a little more than Xinyi Songshan in the East District.

1293
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,420
slightly smaller

1294
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,420
what's the point of this

1295
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:41,620
As long as one cubic kilometer of magma comes up

1296
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,120
probably just like

1297
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,620
It is so big before reaching the platform

1298
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:51,620
Maybe the deep sea is a little bigger than the deep sea eruption

1299
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,880
that would be terrible

1300
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,420
So it's not like all this magma will burst the surface

1301
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,420
Actually it's only 1%

1302
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,460
A percentage of the earth's surface will actually cause a volcanic eruption

1303
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,500
So it's very dangerous

1304
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,500
Well, of course this is

1305
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,000
Because of the results of these studies

1306
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
So the central

1307
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
except the legislature

1308
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Then the Executive Yuan has done some

1309
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
this coping

1310
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,500
So a business plan for a volcanic disaster

1311
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,000
no matter central place now

1312
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
must follow above

1313
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Some mechanisms of this strain

1314
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,500
Alright, let's find out the sales and trading team

1315
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,500
but for me

1316
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,000
In fact, the challenge is greater

1317
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,500
The reason is that this is

1318
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,000
Our so-called colleague Huang Xinhua did it

1319
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
what to do at this yellowstone park

1320
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
There is a extension library under it

1321
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
there is a

1322
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
that's in taiwan

1323
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,500
I think it's 20 kilometers

1324
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,000
what we see is this one

1325
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
actually more worried

1326
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
do you have this money

1327
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,500
That's because our resolution is limited

1328
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,000
so I dare not speak

1329
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Is there any upper land?

1330
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
So the Ministry of Science and Technology gave me an order saying

1331
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
keep looking

1332
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
we'll just mention one

1333
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,500
pretty big plan

1334
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,000
Make them like this for the ninth month

1335
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
we are in northern taiwan

1336
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Ministry of Secret Codes for Seismic Stations

1337
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I hope that Datun Mountain and Guishan

1338
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,680
Find it in the magma chambers of these two volcanoes

1339
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:07,000
In fact, we also found the magma chamber on Guishan Island.

1340
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
The article is under review

1341
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,500
should be out soon

1342
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,500
So there is definitely a magma reservoir under Guishan

1343
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:17,500
So we want to take this size depth

1344
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,500
Hope to find it out

1345
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,500
So I hope to finish this project in four years

1346
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,500
That's the black street station of our first year department

1347
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,500
Then the next year I hope to fill the white

1348
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Then in the third and fourth years, I can really do some analysis and research

1349
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,500
Next is this TVU

1350
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,500
This volcano looks like it's on fire

1351
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,000
eruption cannot be ruled out

1352
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,500
what shall we do

1353
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,000
This fear is often rooted in ignorance

1354
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,500
This is the Aso volcano just mentioned in Japan

1355
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,000
There are railroad houses and a lot of residents inside.

1356
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
This is a big crater

1357
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,000
people live in it

1358
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
lived for decades

1359
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
20 years, hundreds of years, maybe a thousand years

1360
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
they didn't panic

1361
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
live inside the crater

1362
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Where is that reason?

1363
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
This one is more interesting

1364
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
This is Chapelle May 1 spray 8

1365
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Director Chen of the NCD

1366
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
send me this one and say

1367
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
wow this is great

1368
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
You see, this old beauty seems very handsome

1369
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
The volcano is covered in ashes

1370
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
he plays golf there

1371
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
The reason is that they are not afraid

1372
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
The reason not to be afraid is not because you have courage

1373
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
because of what ? with this backer

1374
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
This is Chapelle Volcano off this station

1375
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Bottom this next to this

1376
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Less than 100 meters to the crater

1377
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
When I visited last year, I asked him

1378
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
How deep is your crater along the river?

1379
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
He said 3 kilometers

1380
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I said wow, 3 kilometers away, you still dare to live here

1381
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
This has a history of 100 years

1382
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Why?

1383
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
The volcano will erupt 8 will not be instant

1384
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
There will be action, there will be warning

1385
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
so they can

1386
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
so they are in good hands

1387
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:08,160
Therefore, they use earth sciences to monitor all kinds of air, surface or underground.

1388
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,880
as long as there is movement

1389
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,480
Before the volcano erupts, there should be

1390
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,320
Like the one from Weisway just now, it is the oldest one a few years ago

1391
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,360
18.4 billion years old

1392
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,360
This is a very old painting

1393
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,960
that is the status quo

1394
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,240
Isn't this Pompeii already covered?

1395
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,240
Why is there still a volcano observatory?

1396
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,600
original intention is

1397
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,280
sorry

1398
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,200
Pompeii south of Visway

1399
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,600
There is also a Napolis to the north of him

1400
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,560
So this also needs to be Watched

1401
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,600
to observe

1402
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,760
That day the volcano will

1403
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,640
unlucky for these people

1404
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,800
so they have to monitor

1405
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,040
So we are at Datong Volcano

1406
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,040
We're going to set up an observatory

1407
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,520
This is the hardware provided by Yangmingnan National Park

1408
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,080
it's a nice environment

1409
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,900
We have borrowed four or five offices here

1410
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,900
Then build this observatory

1411
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:10,900
At the beginning, the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of the Interior

1412
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,400
Because the national public health belongs to the Ministry of the Interior

1413
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,400
We have a MEMO

1414
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,900
and then construct this

1415
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,900
So the Ministry of Science and Technology paid the main money

1416
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,400
Our Chinese is also the main person

1417
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,400
not only me

1418
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,900
Many technicians at our Earth Institute

1419
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,900
researchers participate in

1420
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,400
Ministry of Science and Technology

1421
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,400
Hardware equipment from the Ministry of the Interior

1422
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,400
Out of electricity, out of house, out of air-conditioning

1423
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,400
Because this is not actually a

1424
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,400
Very simple one unit can perform

1425
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,400
So we integrated a lot of

1426
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,400
Then this is our observatory

1427
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,400
The location of the instrument distribution

1428
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,400
This is the triangular fault just mentioned

1429
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,400
This is the entire area of ​​Yangmingshan

1430
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,400
Conceptually this is a picture

1431
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,400
That is, we have spread a lot on the surface

1432
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:55,900
different instruments

1433
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,900
Including seismographs Crustal deformation Geochemistry

1434
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,900
ground temperature sprayed in

1435
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I always hope that as long as the volcano has erupted before

1436
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
We believe that there should be some anomalies in these

1437
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Then we have to report to the government, the people and everyone.

1438
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Said the volcano may have started to restless

1439
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
This is our real-time monitoring station

1440
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
So we send a lot of real-time news to this screen for discussion

1441
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Then this picture is the enlarged one just now

1442
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
This four-one picture is if people go up

1443
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
In fact, the surface of the earth will deform the crust, right?

1444
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
be raised or arched

1445
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
We have to rely on GPS to tilt the level

1446
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
we can measure the deformation of its crust

1447
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
And then here's like volcanic gas

1448
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Because its concentration composition will also change

1449
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
It is conceivable that the temperature will also increase

1450
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
that special seismic activity

1451
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Because my specialty is seismic activity

1452
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
that seismic activity is

1453
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Of course I know best

1454
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
and I believe the most useful

1455
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
a concept map

1456
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,400
The usual magma has not changed for 10 kilometers, 20 kilometers I don’t know

1457
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,700
Because the magma is hot

1458
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,300
So there's a little bit of an earthquake on it

1459
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,900
But if the magma runs from A to B like this

1460
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,300
Lava will come up

1461
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,700
what will happen to this incredible thing

1462
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,200
Due to the change of temperature and pressure above

1463
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,500
There will be many, many earthquakes

1464
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,700
For example, our Yangmingshan is now one month

1465
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,500
Maybe only three or five earthquakes every day

1466
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,900
If the magma goes up

1467
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,400
i predict or i imagine

1468
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,900
There may be 500 to 1000 earthquakes in one day

1469
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,900
That's obviously different

1470
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,900
Our record map is secretly referring to earthquakes

1471
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,500
I don't want to see but when I see

1472
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,400
That means there is follow-up action

1473
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,300
when the moon goes up

1474
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,200
This is called a volcanic eruption.

1475
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,500
But you can say from B to C

1476
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,600
When this earthquake B, the earthquake may be 3 kilometers

1477
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,700
There is one kilometer left at C

1478
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,000
here maybe

1479
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,600
5km or 10km

1480
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,600
what does this mean

1481
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,600
We only need the depth of the earthquake to determine it

1482
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:09,500
Must slowly change from deep to front

1483
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:13,300
It's maybe 20 days from here to here

1484
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,600
I know it runs 0.5 kilometers a day

1485
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,300
If it is 3 days from here to here

1486
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:22,700
I just saw it run 0.2km a day or something

1487
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,100
can i estimate

1488
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,500
I guess it's okay

1489
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,100
That could be 10 days or a week to the surface

1490
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,900
so i can't tell you guys

1491
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,500
Will the volcano erupt next year?

1492
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,800
This time is too far away, I can't follow

1493
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:39,200
But if say a month the volcano will

1494
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,000
The volcano will erupt in a month

1495
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,200
I am sure I will see the exception

1496
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,500
I'll see a spike in these earthquakes

1497
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,500
Of course it's not just an earthquake

1498
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:52,000
That is, the volcanic gas is immediately deformed, low temperature

1499
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,900
There should always be exceptions to this

1500
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:57,700
When integrated, there should be good information to judge

1501
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,900
That also means that this is the approximate timeline

1502
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,760
I can roughly estimate how long it might take to reach the surface

1503
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,500
Similarly, if I see Huangzui Mountain

1504
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,300
Earthquakes are coming out of Huangzui Mountain

1505
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,400
I just want to say that Huangzui Mountain may approach the surface along the river.

1506
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,860
If it is in the big oil pit

1507
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:15,800
I knew that the big oil pit might move around along the river

1508
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,300
so i know something

1509
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,600
Then if I see a big oil pit, a small oil pit

1510
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,600
Why is Huang Zuishan so troublesome?

1511
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,200
The rep said, wow, it's serious all of a sudden.

1512
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,200
it's comprehensive, right?

1513
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,200
So the size time

1514
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,800
Probably scientifically, I can make an estimate

1515
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,000
So we did a lot of observations

1516
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,400
But of course there have been no volcanic eruptions since

1517
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,200
it's very lucky

1518
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,600
But even if we don't have volcanic eruptions

1519
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,000
we do scientific research

1520
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,600
We still found a lot of interesting things

1521
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,300
what is interesting

1522
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,100
we are earthquake

1523
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,300
I will talk about the earthquake part

1524
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,000
this is

1525
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,500
Each line is a record of twenty hours a day

1526
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,000
A black is fifteen minutes

1527
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,100
and then the blue one for an hour

1528
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,720
It's two hours, twenty-four hours

1529
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:05,760
Show you four or five hours in the middle of the night

1530
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,600
The ground is shaking

1531
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,520
When I first saw this ten years ago I wanted to say

1532
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,520
That's the car

1533
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,400
What is the wind and tide?

1534
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,200
That is, there are many people in Yangmingshan anyway.

1535
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,400
but i want to say

1536
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:24,000
The time pair is ten o'clock in the middle of the night to two and three o'clock in the morning

1537
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,960
impossible to have a car

1538
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,800
unless it's something weird

1539
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,040
Well, based on science, we certainly believe it is

1540
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,320
is to believe in science

1541
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,720
So there should be no human activity

1542
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:39,120
That should be this natural phenomenon

1543
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,040
So it's as simple as

1544
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,640
You can imagine if this pot is slapping and burning

1545
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,760
if heated

1546
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,760
when the pressure builds

1547
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,840
Doesn't the lid of the pot cause steam?

1548
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,240
will it vibrate all the time

1549
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,920
The vibration is likely to cause

1550
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,000
The concept that the entire surface of the earth is shaking

1551
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,720
That's also very interesting

1552
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,920
This is a certain earthquake

1553
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,000
is one, two, three, four

1554
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,260
More than a dozen earthquake battles all counted a signal at the same time

1555
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,800
Then this signal is called to look like a drop

1556
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:10,160
This is an earthquake record in the shape of a water drop in the scientific community

1557
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,260
This is similar to the earthquake in Hualien, Chiayi, for example.

1558
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,760
completely different shape

1559
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,760
These earthquakes in Hualien, Chiayi look

1560
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,600
We look at P wave X wave Heptathlon people

1561
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,960
They all do this every day

1562
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,200
But this one can't see the P wave at all

1563
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,000
X wave saw a very special

1564
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,460
Just like a drop of energy

1565
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:27,960
Then if you look closely at its frequency

1566
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,420
that's more interesting

1567
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:31,420
it is single frequency

1568
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,420
it's about three to a few hertz

1569
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:35,920
single frequency signal

1570
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,760
How can there be a single-frequency signal in nature?

1571
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,460
it's incredible

1572
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,660
That's easy, of course, let's talk about

1573
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:44,660
Everyone play enough instruments

1574
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:46,460
If you wave the strings of one of the lamps

1575
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,320
It's all single frequency, right?

1576
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,220
That means it looks like someone is rippling a string underground

1577
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,620
Of course it's impossible

1578
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:55,820
The real reason is that

1579
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,580
Because the magma under the ground

1580
01:06:58,580 --> 01:06:59,820
it actually has these

1581
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,500
When the gas or liquid in these cracks

1582
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,800
It only takes a change in pressure

1583
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,300
or move quickly

1584
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,300
The whole rock wall will shake

1585
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:15,700
The frequency of shaking is determined by its width and length

1586
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,300
like peeling a spin

1587
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:20,000
If the thickness and length of its spin are fixed

1588
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,300
its frequency is fixed

1589
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,500
the width of the crack

1590
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,300
Its geometry is the same as it is a single frequency

1591
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,700
This is really our interpretation

1592
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,300
Rothstein

1593
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:32,800
super like rostin

1594
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,600
called English they called Tornitos

1595
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,300
this is very famous

1596
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:43,300
Anyone who does volcanoes and earthquakes knows

1597
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,500
Why

1598
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,400
In Central America just those volcanoes

1599
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,200
They usually see this first when they erupt

1600
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,200
Seeing this allergy has a volcano erupts

1601
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,000
So this turns out to be an indicator of volcanoes in Central America

1602
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,600
but can't say

1603
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,000
Taiwan sees this volcanic eruption

1604
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,400
Because different volcanoes behave differently

1605
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,400
some volcanoes

1606
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
It can be used as a reference, but what we saw on Dalun Mountain

1607
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,000
It does not mean that the volcano is going to erupt, but it means that it is the color of some activities of the volcano

1608
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Then you look at its frequency which is more interesting, it is 2.1, 4.2, 6.3, 8.4

1609
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
It's just a few special multiplier signals

1610
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Of course, this is also a ratio, as if you plucked 3 strings on the pipa

1611
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Those three different frequencies come out, so there can't be these options underneath.

1612
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
The same is when you have an extension to a different column seam at the same time

1613
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,000
A row of seams is a frequency, B row of seams is a series of seams with a frequency

1614
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,000
If it is blown at the same time, it will come out with some fixed frequencies when bitten.

1615
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,000
There is also this low frequency, in fact its frequency is very low

1616
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Then this one is also very classic, the eruption of the Pinda Tubo volcano just mentioned

1617
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Do it for me on January 17th, at the erupting...

1618
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
in the first ten days or so

1619
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
they see these things

1620
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Hundreds of low-frequency earthquakes came out

1621
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Finally they explained

1622
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
When the magma runs in the cracks of the rock

1623
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
low frequency signal

1624
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
So this is also a good indicator

1625
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
If Dalinshan we see

1626
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
a lot of this words

1627
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
It's also a big warning sign

1628
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
That also has the Cheung Chau flag

1629
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
In fact, there are quite a lot of pigs of this kind.

1630
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I will speed up a little bit

1631
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Then let's take what the chairman told us at the time.

1632
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Academician Mr. Li You

1633
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Later, he was also the director of our Earth Science Rescue Institute.

1634
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
After he chaired the committee here

1635
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Then we finish this volcano observatory

1636
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Of course the mission of the Volcano Observatory

1637
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
mainly volcanic disasters

1638
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
But it actually seems to be a negative

1639
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
But there are also positive

1640
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
this volcanic resource

1641
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Seismic Development

1642
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
In fact, they are two sides of the same body.

1643
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
If we take these magma

1644
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
These earthquake surveys are clear

1645
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,280
In fact, it can be applied

1646
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,940
Two Yamada Production Axis

1647
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:05,800
what is it

1648
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:10,460
Huo Garden is very beautiful natural landscape

1649
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:13,000
There are also volcanic fumaroles

1650
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,760
The hole of exile is a landscape unique to these volcanoes

1651
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,880
different time periods

1652
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,520
Huang Wen during the day

1653
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,560
very beautiful

1654
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,960
These are some photos taken by our TVU colleagues over there

1655
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:29,240
It has snowed in the past two years

1656
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,240
It's also very rare

1657
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:35,200
The snow scene throughout our TVU

1658
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,000
that hot spring

1659
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,920
After these beautiful landscapes

1660
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,200
If in the development of hot springs

1661
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,560
The development of four

1662
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,440
Could provide a better tour

1663
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,560
An area for leisure

1664
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:54,560
Then these are these snow monkeys in Hokkaido, Japan

1665
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,600
they also know

1666
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,640
Take a hot spring when it's cold

1667
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,160
The largest seismic development is the

1668
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
is Iceland

1669
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,000
Iceland actually they

1670
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,400
In addition to enjoying these hot springs

1671
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,600
They are also the world's geothermal development

1672
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,800
About Iceland's Energy Roughly

1673
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,600
More than 80% are geothermal

1674
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,200
So they don't need Henan factory

1675
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,200
Henan plant does not need to burn coal

1676
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,200
they enjoy the natural

1677
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,400
Since Taiwan has these volcanic geothermal

1678
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,600
actually

1679
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:25,200
Conceptually, we should do some work here

1680
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,400
So will continental volcanoes have geothermal development?

1681
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,600
In addition to volcanic construction

1682
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,200
In fact, I also spent some time thinking

1683
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,000
doing these jobs

1684
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,600
We put up some seismic stations that look like

1685
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,800
There seems to be a big one here

1686
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,200
Hot discussion storage area

1687
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,600
if science

1688
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,000
This should be

1689
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,000
Geothermal development should be a good place

1690
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,600
But I don't believe he's in a national park.

1691
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,600
This environmental protection regulation may also design customer service

1692
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,600
but anyway

1693
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,760
At the level of technology, we can do some related things

1694
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,720
Well, the map part is more fun

1695
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,640
this voice

1696
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,140
This is actually the media or something

1697
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,820
You may also have the impression

1698
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:15,020
After a while, it was said that someone heard a strange sound

1699
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:17,980
That's 15 years

1700
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:19,220
someone heard something

1701
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:21,940
Anyway, some descriptions mean that there is sound

1702
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:26,020
Someone over here heard someone over here

1703
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:27,420
In fact, when the media came to ask us

1704
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:30,140
I probably have a score but it wasn't organized well at that time

1705
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:32,140
so just pretend not to know

1706
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,380
I probably know it all by now

1707
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:36,060
also in history

1708
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,900
You see, this is 1835 and 53 years

1709
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:42,380
Three Days of Summer Big Butt Sandwich

1710
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:44,180
it will be very noisy

1711
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:45,580
then we

1712
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:48,020
Since we do these our TBO colleagues

1713
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:49,820
Now I often call and say

1714
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:52,860
The teacher heard the name of the place this morning

1715
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,060
It's just that some people can hear it and some people can't.

1716
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,500
of course

1717
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:59,220
some say some don't

1718
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:00,020
is there any

1719
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,400
we rely on evidence

1720
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,000
There are of course many reasons for place names

1721
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
There are various other place names with earthquakes

1722
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Today we're going to talk about the place names of Huo Zhan

1723
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
this is our sacrificial

1724
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
this is about five minutes long

1725
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
But I'd say it's like five seconds or less

1726
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
The reason is because everyone may fall asleep after listening to it for five minutes.

1727
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
The first reason is that if five minutes ago

1728
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
In fact, its frequency is very low

1729
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
you can't hear

1730
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Because our ears are from 20Hz to 20,000Hz

1731
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
normal person

1732
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
If it is 10Hz

1733
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
we can't hear

1734
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
just too low frequency

1735
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
or too high frequency

1736
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
So for everyone to hear

1737
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I call it a little time-lapse sound

1738
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
turn five minutes into five seconds

1739
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
this is overclocking

1740
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
But the five flavors are just like a plane flying past

1741
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
But this we based on these signals

1742
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
actually you see

1743
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,400
This is a different kind of earthquake warfare

1744
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,700
Why Earthquake Warfare Receives Sound

1745
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:05,600
In fact, the sound is the vibration of air

1746
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,900
air shaken to the surface

1747
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,300
our ruins on the surface

1748
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:11,800
Shake our relics too

1749
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,400
Because shaking the ground shakes the ruins

1750
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,500
relics will shake holes

1751
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,000
So let's take these cases into account

1752
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,800
Then these earthquake shadows we can see

1753
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,900
You see this is every earthquake video received

1754
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,700
Then we according to its sequence

1755
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,200
we can go and find out where it is

1756
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,300
For example, we found it in a small oil pit

1757
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,300
very clear

1758
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,000
I don't know if it's here or here

1759
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,700
About 10 meters to 50 meters

1760
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:37,200
But it won't go outside the small oil pit

1761
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,400
Anyway, it's here in three minutes

1762
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,800
very sure

1763
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,100
This is just about one hundred and two minutes

1764
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:50,700
I put it like two seconds

1765
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:51,600
you will hear

1766
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,400
Actually, look carefully at this

1767
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,400
This picture alone is enough to write an article

1768
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:00,000
This, this, this scientific international article

1769
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,420
I will discuss this

1770
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:03,800
this is time

1771
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,160
this is the frequency

1772
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:08,360
This is when the whole thing explodes

1773
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,560
Then before it explodes it has frequency from

1774
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,600
70Hz has been adjusted to almost 40Hz

1775
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,260
The frequency is always deactivated and then detonated

1776
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:20,360
In fact, there is a very simple description, just like playing that heavy sky cannon when I was a child

1777
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:23,200
You chirp at one point and it explodes in the sky

1778
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,560
That's certainly not a heavy sky cannon

1779
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,760
This actually has good physics behind it

1780
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,360
We probably don't have time to talk about deeper things

1781
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:33,120
Xiaoerkeng is actually

1782
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,060
These things are often recorded

1783
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:36,260
That child's pit is more interesting

1784
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:37,520
This is the location of the children's pit

1785
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,160
You climbed up to Qiqisan in Xiaoerkeng

1786
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,220
this is the trail

1787
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:44,220
You can see these little pits along the trail

1788
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:46,860
Then it actually becomes a series of cracks

1789
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:49,660
How did these cracks come about?

1790
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:52,860
In fact, I know where these place names come from.

1791
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:54,560
Actually this is every

1792
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,620
Just now the one that exploded like a heavy sky cannon

1793
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:58,480
result

1794
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,980
mean to say

1795
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,800
Of course, this small hole was not dropped when it rained.

1796
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,400
In turn it is a gas explosion from within

1797
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,400
It's when there's a lot of pressure underneath

1798
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,080
it explodes instantly

1799
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,440
It's a hole when it explodes

1800
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,280
so it goes along this fault line

1801
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,880
just a hole a hole a hole

1802
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:20,680
It's just that the geological age has been exploding.

1803
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,920
That's how it flows on the surface

1804
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:26,320
Then if you briefly show the entire fracture hole

1805
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,360
These are all one by one

1806
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:31,920
It seems that these pits are connected when it rains

1807
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,120
very very many

1808
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,600
The rep says it's actually been active

1809
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,800
It's just that we haven't paid attention to it

1810
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,200
Generally speaking, when we talk about volcanic eruptions, it is flames that come out.

1811
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,600
That like this steam explosion just wanted to look like

1812
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,400
That's the sound of that explosion

1813
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,360
That's like Hawaii

1814
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,360
Or a lot of it is the flame plasma to the surface

1815
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,840
There are lava flows and broken cave flows

1816
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,000
what is this one

1817
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,600
It's just like Kaohsiung gas explosion

1818
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:57,800
exploded

1819
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,000
only this

1820
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
That's why we can burn the pot and blow it up to gain strength

1821
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Then don't say it doesn't seem threatening.

1822
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,000
On January 3, 2014, he was an explosive

1823
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
He also caused the deaths of more than 60 people

1824
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
That death is really unfortunate

1825
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,000
it's autumn and it's noon

1826
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
then he is saturday

1827
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Because this January 3rd is like our neutral mountains

1828
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Usually no one lives nearby

1829
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
But the autumn wind is also super beautiful

1830
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
A group of people went hiking on Saturday

1831
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Then when I ran to the top of the mountain

1832
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Their habit is when they reach the top of the mountain

1833
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
reach the top of the mountain before noon

1834
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Come down for a crispy or bento

1835
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
So it's almost noon and everybody's at the top of the mountain

1836
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
As a result, the explosion at that time

1837
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
That's why six or seventy

1838
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
if it's monday or three o'clock in the afternoon

1839
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
a cat is fine

1840
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
it's such an unfortunate thing

1841
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
this is every day

1842
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
This is Yang Mingzhang, we counted

1843
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
because it sounds like a bird

1844
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
is still in the woods

1845
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
this one is a little longer

1846
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
about two minutes

1847
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
In fact, I have collected a lot of these

1848
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
no i can't listen

1849
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
This is like a train

1850
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
played the sound of a train

1851
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,000
This is like a giant tree

1852
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
that's good

1853
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Then this giant tree just now

1854
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Actually, I'm going to write another article

1855
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Let's just talk about it. It's a volcano conversation.

1856
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
In fact, it is one by one

1857
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
This jet tube happens and the other is this one

1858
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
So A and B are over there

1859
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
sing together

1860
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
super interesting

1861
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
It's the dialogue of the volcano

1862
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,600
Then this is Zhongshan Luo and Ziping after spraying

1863
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,800
Then it's like the two are talking

1864
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,800
The last one is

1865
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:20,800
It was an accident that the dean of Guoyun

1866
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,800
I'll skip it first

1867
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:27,200
That's the sound of Dean Guoyun seeing my volcanoes

1868
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:35,200
He went to the Academy of Performing Arts

1869
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,200
He said this voice can be used as background

1870
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,200
they played for two hours

1871
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,200
Just those pictures over there

1872
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,200
I'm going to listen to this kind of wow, this is really exciting

1873
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:49,200
This is the combination of science and humanities

1874
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,200
final volcano heartbeat

1875
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:55,200
Seismic.com has recorded many earthquakes

1876
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,200
nothing special

1877
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,200
But the funny thing is that we are here in Dayoukeng

1878
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,760
remember hundreds of earthquakes

1879
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,060
What's so special about this earthquake?

1880
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:07,700
This is the new electrogram

1881
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:10,060
Every black line here is

1882
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,000
This one is an earthquake station

1883
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,440
Every earthquake also has a

1884
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,940
just an earthquake

1885
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:18,240
So when an earthquake occurs

1886
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,440
For all stations received

1887
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,540
This one bar after another is an earthquake

1888
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:25,740
For example, if I look at a single one, it's fine.

1889
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:27,640
single station you see

1890
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:30,540
When each vertical bar

1891
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:32,540
just a small earthquake

1892
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:35,540
Then this small earthquake turned out to be periodic

1893
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:36,540
Hualien Earthquake

1894
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,740
probably no one can understand

1895
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:39,640
when will the next earthquake occur

1896
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,440
But I'm here to tell you

1897
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,640
Now there's another 18 minutes

1898
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:44,640
in 18 minutes

1899
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,640
do statistics here

1900
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:49,340
Of course not, it's just a few seconds off.

1901
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:51,840
There will be one in these 18 or 19 minutes

1902
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,640
This is about 1, 200 earthquakes

1903
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,740
every 18 minutes

1904
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:56,840
We know our new tickets are

1905
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,440
Seventy to eighty beats per minute

1906
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,140
But you count this 18 minutes

1907
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Seventy or eighty times a day

1908
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
means he dances very slowly

1909
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,000
But it's more interesting to say when this heartbeat started

1910
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,000
He is from a 4.8 earthquake in Hualien

1911
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
When the earthquake wave reaches Yangmingshan

1912
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
heartbeat starts beating

1913
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
He's not Moby

1914
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
He looks like someone is going to wake him up and bite him

1915
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
It's time for a heartbeat

1916
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
This is another Taichung earthquake

1917
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
3.7 As soon as the earthquake came, Bobobo's heartbeat came

1918
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
it happened three times

1919
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Although there were three times I was super excited

1920
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Earthquakes are periodic

1921
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
This is something I've never heard of in the whole world

1922
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
then i will make a metaphor

1923
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
normal heartbeat

1924
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Then there is a problem with the image

1925
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Start trimmer, start jumping wildly, stop jumping after jumping

1926
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
then jump again

1927
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Then sent to the hospital, of course the electric shock

1928
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Shock again jump jump jump jump up

1929
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
So the Hualien earthquake Taichung reporter seemed to be telegraphed

1930
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
So Yang Mingshan may have fallen asleep

1931
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
It's just a new dance. I haven't danced for a long time.

1932
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
The earthquake shocked him and made him start jumping

1933
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
But it's a metaphor, not a real thing

1934
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
a fun thing

1935
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
It's this new jump that kills

1936
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Animal Xiao Laozi jumped hundreds of times

1937
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
his life is short

1938
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Elephants are good at jumping very slowly

1939
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
then live longer

1940
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Of course that man is no longer an animal.

1941
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Humans are no longer ordinary animals

1942
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
This quote means

1943
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Anyway, the faster the new jump, the shorter the life

1944
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Well if this extends it to volcanoes

1945
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
In those 18 minutes, he danced super slow and super slow

1946
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
so he can live a long time

1947
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I'm unscientific

1948
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
a bit silly

1949
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
that last summary

1950
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
we're back at mainland mountain

1951
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,000
cooperate with this health committee

1952
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,800
Metropolis and Old Town of Taipei

1953
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,600
Taipei City is a city of millions of people

1954
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:08,200
Of course Vesuvius, Pompeii, has 20,000 people

1955
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,980
This is much worse

1956
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,800
That's about 10 kilometers away.

1957
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,840
are very similar distances

1958
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,640
that is volcanic

1959
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:18,440
The continent's volcanoes

1960
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:20,740
This date may be 6000 years

1961
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:24,060
But Vesuvius actually sprayed it again in 1914

1962
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:28,160
The height of Seven Star Mountain and Vesuvi is actually over a thousand

1963
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:30,460
That's mainly interesting

1964
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,780
The area of ​​our magma chamber is about 70 square kilometers

1965
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:34,820
Vesuvius probably

1966
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:35,840
400

1967
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:37,380
actually bigger

1968
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,660
6, 7 times

1969
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,700
6 times is actually bigger

1970
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,240
The top of the volcanic block is relatively large

1971
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:43,780
The depth is relatively shallow

1972
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,320
So we go a little deeper

1973
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:46,600
deeper

1974
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:47,360
but

1975
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:50,440
We are now trying to find out if there is a 5km or 10km

1976
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:51,460
Magma reservoir

1977
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:52,740
then this is us

1978
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,520
work in recent years

1979
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,840
history in the sea of ​​course this

1980
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,840
The side is also terrible

1981
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Yangmingshan no

1982
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,440
The last one is what we want to convey today

1983
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,440
Whether it's a big volcano or a small volcano

1984
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,440
Population nearby or far away

1985
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,440
In fact, in the past, science can tell us

1986
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,440
you just do monitoring

1987
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,440
very easy thing

1988
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:19,440
There is probably a considerable degree of protection

1989
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,440
Monitoring is a simple matter in terms of science

1990
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:25,440
You just put the instrument down and do some analysis

1991
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,440
and then probably give us some

1992
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,440
good reference instrument

1993
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,440
The ancient city of Weishuwei is here

1994
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,440
But Napoli so they keep doing it

1995
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,440
This is a volcanic city

1996
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:39,440
cities on or around volcanoes

1997
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,440
Taipei is also one of the volcano cities

1998
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,440
the problem is that

1999
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,440
Will the volcano move?

2000
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,440
we do not know

2001
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,440
but we have to be prepared

2002
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,440
if one day it moves

2003
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,440
we need to know in advance

2004
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,440
That's the job of the Big Volcano Spectator Station

2005
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,440
so simple question

2006
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,440
I am often asked by many people

2007
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,800
So maybe now you guys can answer

2008
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Will the first one be active again? Yes

2009
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,800
I usually don't dare to speak

2010
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,800
I usually want to say that it cannot be ruled out

2011
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,600
more like this

2012
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:18,400
And the second question is, will spending money be attractive? Yes

2013
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,800
everyone trust me

2014
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,400
I often give speeches here and there and tell people that's what I say

2015
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,600
But actually I'm pretty stressed when I go home

2016
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,400
Where did it come from? A volcanic eruption

2017
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,800
I still haven't told everyone that I might

2018
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,400
may have to kill himself

2019
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,800
And where did the millions of citizens flee to?

2020
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,800
This is the section chief of the Taipei exercise

2021
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,400
been looking up i mean

2022
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,200
What should I do? What should Mr. Lin do?

2023
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,600
He said where are our six million people going?

2024
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,400
I said don't scare yourself

2025
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:51,800
There is no such thing as six million people, right?

2026
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,200
That Qiandu also wanted to say that we will move to Taichung.

2027
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:59,800
The last question has an answer

2028
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
We should not be the ancient city of Pangbei

2029
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
In addition to many natural conditions

2030
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
what is the most important

2031
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Time and space are different, right?

2032
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
2000 years ago there was no science

2033
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
people don't know what's going on

2034
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
but we now have science

2035
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Science can tell us many answers

2036
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
So the simple answer is no

2037
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
so this is the festival

2038
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
just want us to be with the volcano

2039
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Coexistence king but through science

2040
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Finally, I would like to thank the relevant units

2041
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Because this plan has actually been in the works for more than ten years.

2042
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
It's this big plan that has been in the works for more than ten years.

2043
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,000
The process is not a single

2044
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
this this department

2045
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
or Chinese

2046
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
can pay for all this

2047
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
So we use various channels

2048
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
and then go to convince people

2049
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
give money to people

2050
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
So let's build this volcano-official battle

2051
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
ok this took a while

2052
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Very sorry

2053
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Thanks

2054
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Well, we thank Researcher Lin for a very good presentation.

2055
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Now the rest of our time is open to questions

2056
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:21,000
We have prepared exquisite gifts on site

2057
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
hand over here

2058
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:27,000
We have ten, so the first ten

2059
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
If the first ten people ask questions, they will get a small gift

2060
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
There's that microphone in front of you guys

2061
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
wait a minute for a question

2062
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
please use the microphone

2063
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Click on a green part

2064
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
This will turn the microphone on

2065
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,000
now what's your question

2066
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
here

2067
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Hello Mr. Lin

2068
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,000
ok actually what i want to ask is

2069
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
If an alert occurs

2070
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
There will be a volcanic eruption in the next ten days

2071
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
no results

2072
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
seems more serious

2073
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
It's like a typhoon is coming, and it's a holiday

2074
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
No, my question is actually

2075
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
The characteristics of Tatun Volcano are different from other volcanoes

2076
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
For example, are the volcanoes in Hawaii different?

2077
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
In other words, just ten days ago

2078
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
That dense vibration thing

2079
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
In fact, I have no way to prove the Datun Volcano

2080
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Really like that, time really explodes in the future

2081
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
unless it really explodes

2082
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Then this experience comes from the situation of the volcano in Hawaii

2083
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Will they be the same

2084
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
still may be different thanks

2085
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
this is a very good question

2086
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
and you're an insider

2087
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Volcanic outbreaks are not 100%

2088
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
And every volcano behaves differently

2089
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
In fact, the Hawaiian volcano and Mount Fuji

2090
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Or that there are actually many types of volcanoes

2091
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Hawaii is relatively annual magma

2092
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
so it just won't explode

2093
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
This one was blasted

2094
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
It actually flows more like water

2095
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
That's like this volcano in the Pacific Rim

2096
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
it will explode like

2097
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
That's because of its annual consistency

2098
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Or we say its acid-base scientifically

2099
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,920
Its ratio of that SIO2

2100
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,200
you can imagine that

2101
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,160
as a pot of water

2102
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:06,760
rain is like a pot of water

2103
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:08,760
when you heat it up the water boils

2104
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:12,040
But if you cook a pot of porridge

2105
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,440
or corn chowder with words

2106
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,440
when the viscosity is high

2107
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,840
as soon as you boil it it will

2108
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:17,240
it will

2109
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:18,240
pop

2110
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:18,680
right

2111
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:19,600
it's sticky

2112
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,800
it keeps accumulating energy

2113
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:21,040
energy

2114
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,920
then it's about to explode

2115
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:24,520
so different volcanoes

2116
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:26,480
In fact, its composition is different

2117
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,840
it behaves differently

2118
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:28,920
So we can't put

2119
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,520
Xia Yao Pooh or usual Toubot

2120
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:33,360
or any volcanic act to bring

2121
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,360
Predicting what will happen to our big volcanoes

2122
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,560
In fact, it is everyone

2123
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:38,560
or each volcano

2124
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,360
has its own unique personality

2125
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:42,760
So we want to predict the behavior of a person

2126
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,800
We can't put people in A

2127
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,640
past to predict B's

2128
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:48,360
In fact, the risk is great

2129
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,360
we better be

2130
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:52,200
Make a good observation and understanding of A

2131
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,840
See how it behaves

2132
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,640
Then we make predictions based on this

2133
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,040
but even so

2134
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,240
we can't

2135
01:29:59,240 --> 01:29:59,960
Actually there are

2136
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,700
Several volcanoes have said that they think they will erupt.

2137
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,200
This is sometimes because of a very simple reason

2138
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,100
Your magma keeps going up and down, and your successor is unreasonable

2139
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:13,900
In fact, Mount Fuji used to be this year in 2001.

2140
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:16,900
Japanese scientists are extremely nervous with the government

2141
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:19,600
Why did they keep running from 20 kilometers away from the earthquake

2142
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,500
After running 2 kilometers, he thought he might come up tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

2143
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,300
be quiet from now on

2144
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:28,400
So this is still his

2145
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:32,100
With this uncertainty, we can only do our best

2146
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:40,400
Hello teacher, what I want to ask is

2147
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:43,900
It's the shadow of the S wave you mentioned earlier

2148
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:48,400
There is also P-wave's smoke call, which is the place where smoke call arrives

2149
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:52,700
These two phenomena, these two phenomena are what I just said from the teacher.

2150
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,100
I think all I know is that he reflects

2151
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:59,800
He represents the existence of liquid substances under the ground

2152
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Then how can we infer from the existence of this substance

2153
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,080
It is possible to estimate the volume of the magma reservoir and

2154
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:10,080
Is it the depth of these queries Thanks

2155
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:15,120
The volume is calculated according to the surface of our land

2156
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,480
yes or no

2157
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,080
We can probably heat up a range

2158
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:20,720
that depth is a good question

2159
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,680
Depth because of more scientific issues

2160
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,480
That is to say, I didn't talk much here.

2161
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:29,200
That is to say, I use earthquakes at different depths for cross-comparison

2162
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,720
There is a little bit of this depth past and this depth

2163
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:34,240
If cut to yes or no

2164
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:35,840
That is, it has an angle, right?

2165
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,440
If at the very surface it doesn't have both

2166
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:41,920
If it's 10 kilometers maybe it starts a little bit on this side and this side

2167
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,160
there is a gap

2168
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:44,240
So take it slow

2169
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:46,200
But this is just a rough estimate

2170
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,280
That's why we have our second big plan.

2171
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:51,720
Hope to make more accurate

2172
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,680
So something like this

2173
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:56,200
At present, the preliminary results can only reach this

2174
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,860
To make his relationship with that family from four angles

2175
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:11,100
Because of this probably in the whole world I think I'm the first to do this

2176
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:14,840
Because, for example, Mt. Fuji, theirs, or Mount Aso

2177
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:19,360
They are very clear about the evidence of Yeonjangku

2178
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,300
people don't need to do this

2179
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:23,240
That's because it's too controversial in Taiwan

2180
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,200
We can't see that thing on the surface

2181
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:29,060
That's why I worked so hard to come up with a way to verify it.

2182
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:31,560
So this should be the only

2183
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:36,660
The only scientifically I know of anyone doing this

2184
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:37,960
yes

2185
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:42,060
Hello Mr. Lin

2186
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:46,460
I want to ask is in the past geological records

2187
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:50,000
Is the Datong volcanic group like that?

2188
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,060
Is there a record of such spontaneous pyroclastic activity at Yunhyen Volcano?

2189
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:58,060
In history, in our human history, there is no

2190
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:00,060
But in geology

2191
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
If you're interested, I can show you the trail where the debris flows

2192
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:06,760
what's that called

2193
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:11,260
There are several places where there are debris streams on the road.

2194
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,040
We haven't ordered that one yet

2195
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:17,880
We're just like 6,000 years now, just a volcanic ash date

2196
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:22,720
The dating on the other side of the debris flow has not been overcome

2197
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:27,000
But at least there's evidence out there

2198
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,500
is visible from the surface

2199
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:36,500
So I'm not sure if it's possible to be as serious as the suicide in Japan

2200
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:40,000
Are you sure you know there is such a record?

2201
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
There is this record, but the history of our humanity is

2202
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
In Taiwan, it is only possible that there will be no such records in a thousand years or more

2203
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,500
ok thank you teacher

2204
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:53,500
Hello teacher

2205
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:58,500
Invite that Datong Volcanic Group because his age is quite old

2206
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,500
there are two thousand

2207
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,160
More than 8 million to 200,000

2208
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:05,160
Recently, it was just about 50 million

2209
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,880
around 5000 years

2210
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:11,000
So the distribution of a magma chamber in this place

2211
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,920
From a historical point of view, should it be centralized?

2212
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:16,280
because when it's about to spray flowers

2213
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:17,720
There must be cracks sucked out

2214
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:18,520
right

2215
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:23,520
In the period of Big Butt Foshan in Triangular Broken City

2216
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:27,280
Is it possible that there will be cracking and sucking out?

2217
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:31,520
The volume of possible magma chambers relative to

2218
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:35,640
There must also be a match with the split suction

2219
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,560
So when it comes to spraying flowers

2220
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:41,400
Is there one of these two

2221
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,880
a proof

2222
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:44,280
yes

2223
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,520
Now many academic circles or our experts

2224
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,600
probably think it is

2225
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,920
The current triangular city

2226
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:53,440
It's actually a crack

2227
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:57,000
The magma is likely to be on this fissure

2228
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,720
this run up

2229
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:00,160
It is along this line of development

2230
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,000
In fact, we are not sure about the future.

2231
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
But the possibility is possible

2232
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,000
So on this trend along the triangular fault

2233
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Seven Seven Three is right next to the Triangle Fault

2234
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
The big oil pit is not far away

2235
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
We saw that seismic activity

2236
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,000
As far as the seismic activity is concerned, it is on the side of the Seven Seventh Three Oil Pit.

2237
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
It seems to be quite consistent with the geometry of the triangular fault.

2238
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
So it's very likely along the fault knee of the Triangular Fault

2239
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Yan will come up

2240
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
This is guesswork

2241
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
There is one and another inference that says

2242
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
because the triangular fault it belongs to a

2243
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Only one thing on the earthquake fault will have a cracked knee

2244
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Yeah

2245
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
so many years till now

2246
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
200,000 years to the last 50 million years

2247
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Because it is time in the crust to the geology

2248
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
is it going to stabilize

2249
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
or there will be signs of activity

2250
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Research says there is a comparison problem with the magma chamber

2251
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Because if the magma chamber is on the other side

2252
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
There can't be a problem with spraying at this end either.

2253
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Yes, this is actually a good question, that is

2254
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
because of how we do research now

2255
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
mostly now

2256
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Then you have to compare with the past

2257
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
to know whether it is regionally stable or regionally unstable

2258
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,000
But the past evidence is actually super vague.

2259
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
So we just can't compare

2260
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,000
So many people say that the magma is in the process of cooling

2261
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Then of course nothing will happen in the future

2262
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
not cooling but warming

2263
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Then we don't have good evidence to control this

2264
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:47,000
It is now moving up and down

2265
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,000
yes yes yes of course

2266
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Because of the triangular triple island

2267
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Yes Yes Yes

2268
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,600
Yes Yes Yes

2269
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:07,000
Yes Yes Yes

2270
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Yes Yes Yes

2271
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Yes Yes Yes

2272
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Yes Yes Yes

2273
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
There is still a lot of work to be done in this aftermath.

2274
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Thanks

2275
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Hello Professor Li

2276
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
two questions

2277
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
The first one is like our landslides

2278
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
When we all have to issue alerts

2279
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Yellow alert when rainfall exceeds how much

2280
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Or the amount of rainfall exceeds the red alert

2281
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Don't know about our TVO

2282
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Is there any data now

2283
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
when the earthquake exceeds how much

2284
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
or how much the ground temperature exceeds

2285
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
or when the concentration of carbon dioxide reaches

2286
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
we're going to issue an alert

2287
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
We live right under the cape of the volcano

2288
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
we care about that

2289
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
In addition, the second problem is the small travel pit

2290
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
We now call him to the mouth of the mouth

2291
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
he didn't stand in burst

2292
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Let's call him a blowout

2293
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Or call him Collapsing Fire

2294
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
would be more appropriate

2295
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,500
First the second question should be the burst hole

2296
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:08,500
because ben he actually

2297
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:12,000
because most of them think

2298
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,500
He's a breach in a fault zone

2299
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:18,000
that ben his behavior is not like that

2300
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,500
ben he just offline

2301
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:23,500
but he is a concave whole

2302
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:25,500
like a pit

2303
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:28,000
So it's not the same as his line

2304
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
he is a blast

2305
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
so we have a lot to contend with

2306
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
jet

2307
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
the first question is

2308
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
vigilance

2309
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
very difficult

2310
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
But NCDR is the center of the national battlefield

2311
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
or the Executive Yuan or something like that

2312
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Forces me to talk about this every day

2313
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
But I'm here to be honest

2314
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Actually, I know very little

2315
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
But the people or the government need a standard

2316
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,000
So what we are forced to do is a

2317
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:05,880
We try to have no history, no context

2318
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:11,520
So we don't know how crazy this volcano is before it erupts

2319
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:15,620
If it has previous records we can probably use it as a reference

2320
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:17,660
But we don't have any record of this

2321
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:21,760
So we can only put the compulsive ones on the other volcanoes

2322
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:24,840
Many volcanoes in Japan are used as a reference

2323
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:28,920
But I must say that this reference is really just for reference

2324
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:31,680
cannot...

2325
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:35,080
much is still unknown

2326
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:41,080
It is very difficult, because many people and most of the civil government have been asking about this matter

2327
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:43,720
this needs to be worked on

2328
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:46,080
the lady

2329
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:51,840
Mr. Lin, I would like to ask you for advice, because I often take Chinese and foreign tourists to small tourists

2330
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:56,760
I remember that there was a magnitude 5.5 earthquake about half a year ago this year

2331
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:58,360
very close to taipei

2332
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,840
In a few days, I will take tourists to Xiaoyoukeng

2333
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:04,280
I just realized I haven't gone yet

2334
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:05,140
I'm going to the parking lot

2335
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:09,280
I heard a loud noise like a jet plane

2336
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,720
i never heard

2337
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:12,960
wow you're the first to hear

2338
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:13,540
I always

2339
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:14,820
the airport is very big

2340
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:19,460
Because I often take Chinese and foreign tourists to that scenic spot

2341
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:21,360
I've never heard of such a big

2342
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:24,260
as big as a jet plane right next to your ear

2343
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,060
I was thinking then

2344
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:28,260
My video should start leading everyone away

2345
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:29,800
escape with everyone

2346
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,060
But two months later

2347
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:33,160
when i go

2348
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,300
that voice is gone

2349
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:35,900
Then you often monitor over there

2350
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:36,700
i don't know

2351
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,300
This is a very common phenomenon

2352
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:40,860
it's just that loud

2353
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:43,700
The sound of that jet is different from what I usually go to

2354
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:46,860
The other one is that the information I read is that

2355
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:49,200
Are the two judgments

2356
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,400
Volcano

2357
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,860
one that you just listed

2358
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:55,600
All I've read is that

2359
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:56,560
two hundred thousand years

2360
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,600
The first condition is two hundred thousand years

2361
01:40:58,600 --> 01:40:59,660
The second condition is

2362
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Is there a magma chamber

2363
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,500
Then I know that the magma chamber

2364
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:04,800
we now know there is

2365
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,300
So we used to define it as repairing volcanoes

2366
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:08,500
or even a stone volcano

2367
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:10,500
Should be changed now, yes

2368
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:11,800
Then I also read about Guishan Island

2369
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:14,900
The last eruption seems to be 200,000 years ago, isn't it?

2370
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:16,300
four times

2371
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:17,700
then i want to know

2372
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:20,000
I compare the correct dating method

2373
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,200
i should say

2374
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:22,300
which one should be used

2375
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:24,100
Which one was the last eruption?

2376
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,500
Because I obviously 200,000 is out of the question

2377
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:26,300
200,000 is not

2378
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:27,800
ten thousand years

2379
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:29,800
Ten thousand years is actually related to the central

2380
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:30,900
the Geological Survey

2381
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:32,800
active fault

2382
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,700
That is, the most active active fault is 10,000 years old.

2383
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:37,100
So ten thousand years is them

2384
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:39,500
In the geological world, they are equivalent to having a

2385
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:42,000
As long as it is a living geological thing

2386
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,900
regardless of volcanic faults

2387
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:45,400
10,000 is used as a reference

2388
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:46,400
200,000 is too long

2389
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,200
200,000 that carbon

2390
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:50,500
and you just heard me really

2391
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:52,000
also hope that

2392
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,800
if you can take your time

2393
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:55,800
probably tell me

2394
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:58,100
Because we now have a 24 hour record

2395
01:41:58,100 --> 01:41:58,900
That

2396
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,520
If you probably have, how often do you say

2397
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:07,160
In my impression, I watched it carefully for half a year

2398
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:09,120
I spent a lot of time carefully

2399
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:11,560
Just 20 hours of constant inspection

2400
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:14,660
About 10 days on average

2401
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:17,360
two weeks

2402
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:19,600
Anyway, about 10 days or so

2403
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,800
I can probably add to the sound of this so-called place name

2404
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,040
But sometimes very often

2405
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,800
Sometimes it's 3 days

2406
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,800
always have

2407
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,800
sometimes sporadically

2408
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:34,800
Just once or twice a week

2409
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,800
so if you can really hear

2410
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:39,800
Because I often ask people

2411
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:42,800
Because of my information, I see that there is really

2412
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,800
but i didn't really hear anyone

2413
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:48,800
So you probably have this very precious

2414
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,800
is that I believe he usually looks like

2415
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,800
just pissed off

2416
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,800
But sporadically there will be something like

2417
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,800
like firecrackers

2418
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,800
loud this

2419
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,800
exploded

2420
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Otherwise, I can't receive the earthquake

2421
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
like an ice cream machine

2422
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,000
that should be

2423
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,000
What you describe is that it is relatively low frequency

2424
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
then a little longer

2425
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
very double

2426
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Yeah

2427
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
and heavy

2428
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
wow this is very

2429
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
yes

2430
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
yes

2431
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
volcanic words

2432
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
fire volcano it is very common words

2433
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
can there be a way

2434
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
can make it a stone volcano

2435
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Is it right

2436
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
because it is said to be in the volcano

2437
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
while it's working

2438
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
we invest something in

2439
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Yes or no

2440
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
then to destroy it

2441
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
reduce it fire volcano regulations

2442
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
this is feasible

2443
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
but is it possible to do

2444
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
this

2445
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
this

2446
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
this is a bit difficult

2447
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
like an earthquake some people say

2448
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
shock energy failed

2449
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
So this fault

2450
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
he just wanted to say

2451
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
we just let it

2452
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
small earthquake

2453
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
A big earthquake turns into many small earthquakes

2454
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
we water it

2455
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
this is science

2456
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
fault

2457
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
you pump it in

2458
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,760
it will start to slide and release energy

2459
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:06,820
But this is very risky, no one dares to do it, why?

2460
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:15,620
Yes, usually it is fine, if you add water to it, it will cause a big earthquake, who will be responsible

2461
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:21,080
In fact, you can't control it's potion, it's still potion

2462
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:26,820
The same problem, that is, the natural world of volcanoes, I think it may be difficult for us

2463
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:28,820
With current technology it is possible

2464
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:38,960
Because the magma chamber is over there.

2465
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:52,520
It should be said that it is possible, but I don't know how to do it now

2466
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:55,220
Yes

2467
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,160
You just mentioned that Yellowstone is a giant volcano

2468
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:08,840
How is the so-called super large, medium or small volcano defined?

2469
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:10,960
So how dangerous is it?

2470
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:14,800
Probably it is easy for us to define it now, just look at the magma household

2471
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:18,300
Like this volume of the magma house

2472
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:21,040
Like the one in Yellowstone Park, maybe

2473
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:24,880
Seems like thousands of cubic kilometers

2474
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:28,040
A few thousand, not like fifteen thousand or so

2475
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:33,080
It just looks like our big round volcano may only be

2476
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:38,400
Only a hundred, about a hundred Cheng Qi

2477
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:41,760
Of course, the bigger the magma household

2478
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:44,920
It only takes a little bit of it to be quite impressive

2479
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:46,680
If the magma household is small

2480
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:49,880
Of course it is less dangerous

2481
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:51,640
So volcanoes are graded

2482
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:55,280
It is divided into one, two, three, four, and five grades according to the magma

2483
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:58,120
many graded

2484
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:04,000
there is a child

2485
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Just now I saw a few after the volcanic eruption

2486
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Residents have examples of fleeing

2487
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Then I want to ask that after the volcano ceases to be active

2488
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,000
How soon can they go back and live there

2489
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
wow, this is another problem

2490
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,000
In fact, the volcano told people to evacuate

2491
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
relatively easy

2492
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
and then after evacuation

2493
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
when can we let people go back

2494
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
People in general always want to go back

2495
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
it looks like as long as it doesn't smoke

2496
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
he just wants to go back

2497
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,000
But the role unit, the government, is actually very difficult

2498
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
because just said

2499
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
when people go up

2500
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
We can easily see those steps

2501
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
But he scurried to a certain word

2502
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Then start writing...

2503
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
when there is no change

2504
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
When will it suddenly rise again

2505
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
In fact, the politics started to be very blurred

2506
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
even say when it will start to be quiet

2507
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
no good reference

2508
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
sometimes in absolute units

2509
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:07,280
it's just a decision

2510
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:10,480
So going back is actually a big trouble

2511
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:12,480
when can we go back

2512
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:13,980
like hawaii, right?

2513
01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:15,480
move at midnight

2514
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:16,980
then it seems to stop

2515
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:18,580
recently again

2516
01:47:18,580 --> 01:47:20,380
like that paris island

2517
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:23,220
Last October was like two months of activity

2518
01:47:23,220 --> 01:47:24,420
Then it stops in the middle

2519
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:25,780
That July the last July

2520
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:27,780
Paris Island is back in action

2521
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:30,060
So when it starts moving

2522
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:35,020
That kind of estimation is actually more difficult.

2523
01:47:35,020 --> 01:47:37,020
But from being quiet to moving

2524
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:39,020
It's actually easier

2525
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:43,020
from motion to silence

2526
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:45,020
that is

2527
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:47,020
not so easy

2528
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:52,020
so still need a lot

2529
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:54,020
lady behind

2530
01:47:57,780 --> 01:48:00,520
I just want to ask

2531
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,820
that researcher is

2532
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:05,100
Because I told you a long time ago

2533
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:06,700
Earthquakes can be predicted with animals

2534
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:08,620
like a fish or a snake or something

2535
01:48:08,620 --> 01:48:12,020
But have you ever thought about using animals?

2536
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:14,400
I don't know it's probably not practical either

2537
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,500
but maybe there is a way

2538
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:17,900
Have you ever been through this period?

2539
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:20,020
still have you thought about it

2540
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:21,500
this is good

2541
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:24,020
It's the earthquake why we use animals

2542
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:26,020
in what strange way

2543
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:29,100
Because the science of earthquake prediction

2544
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:32,300
At the scientific level, everyone feels that it is not feasible yet.

2545
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:36,820
So everyone is that if you go to a western doctor

2546
01:48:36,820 --> 01:48:38,940
I found out that you are terminally ill and cannot be cured.

2547
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:41,420
Then everyone finds a way, right?

2548
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:43,220
But in terms of volcanoes

2549
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:45,220
He tells you about science

2550
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:46,100
If the volcano wants a prescription

2551
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:48,700
there is a lot of evidence

2552
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:51,020
Why should I look for a remedy?

2553
01:48:51,020 --> 01:48:52,620
So in terms of volcanoes

2554
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:54,940
You do these monitoring for formal evidence

2555
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:56,860
probably the answer

2556
01:48:56,860 --> 01:48:59,220
But the earthquake is still touching

2557
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Thousands of dollars and ideas will come out

2558
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Thanks

2559
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:12,000
I want to confirm one thing with your professor

2560
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,000
months ago

2561
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,000
There was an earthquake at more than four o'clock in Beitou

2562
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Exactly the same result when I saw

2563
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
It seems to be near Zhongshan Building

2564
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,000
That's very close to the volcanoes in the big picture

2565
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Later, the Meteorological Bureau said that it was due to the movement of the plate.

2566
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,000
but i doubt it

2567
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
so according to your opinion

2568
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:40,000
The earthquake caused by the same thing

2569
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Is it really a plate movement?

2570
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Or a shock from the volcanoes

2571
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
if i remember correctly

2572
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,000
you may be asking to have a

2573
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
They called it the Beitou Earthquake at first

2574
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
It's about five o'clock

2575
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Because for many years Taipei City has not

2576
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
the same earthquake that happened

2577
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
The earthquake was actually reported by the Meteorological Bureau.

2578
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,800
There should be nothing wrong, the reason is that the earthquake was more than 100 kilometers deep

2579
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:09,800
So that is the earthquake of the plate that is on the screen with our Philippine Sea plate going north.

2580
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:15,300
It's not on the very shallow surface of the volcano this 10 kilometers

2581
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:18,900
If it's at 5km 10km it's more to do with volcanoes

2582
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:24,500
But is it 140 or what? 140 kilometers, it is very deep, and it has something to do with the plate

2583
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:30,300
So this explanation from the Meteorological Bureau is basically OK.

2584
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:33,300
It is accepted by science

2585
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:37,300
hello mr behind

2586
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:46,500
Hello, Mr. Lin, what I want to ask is, as far as we know, the threat of volcanoes in northern Taiwan

2587
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:52,300
In addition to the Big Butt Volcano, the undersea volcano in Keelung is also a volcanic volcano

2588
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:56,300
And it may have been active in Keelung Sea School in 1867

2589
01:50:56,300 --> 01:50:59,700
In the future, will we target such

2590
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,680
Disaster risk will do some scientific research

2591
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,160
Thanks

2592
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:06,640
Yes, I'm personally very interested

2593
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:09,840
You are actually many, many professional

2594
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:12,200
It is because of Keelung Port

2595
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:13,400
that

2596
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:16,080
Below Zheng there is a seabed and there is a volcano

2597
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:17,080
submarine volcano

2598
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:19,000
And they do ocean exploration

2599
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,800
That volcano will still have majestic

2600
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,320
It means it's a volcano

2601
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:23,760
That teacher Xi Zhiwen from CUHK

2602
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:25,560
And that National Taiwan University teacher Yang Shanghai

2603
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:27,160
they just do some research

2604
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:28,400
Then I also believe

2605
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:29,320
I personally believe

2606
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:30,440
this has to be confirmed

2607
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:33,040
It was the tsunami in 1867

2608
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:34,480
Probably

2609
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:36,880
Because it was said earlier that the tsunami caused by the earthquake

2610
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,360
but the volcano

2611
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:40,640
Tsunamis caused by submarine volcanic activity

2612
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:42,360
In fact, the possibility is quite high

2613
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:43,760
but need evidence

2614
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:45,200
that we need to investigate

2615
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:47,600
So this piece of the future

2616
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:48,400
the government does too

2617
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:49,840
I personally would

2618
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,720
will be very involved in doing it

2619
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:54,760
It's just that the investigation and research in the sea is more difficult

2620
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:56,360
so we need

2621
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:58,480
more of these techniques

2622
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:00,480
or some way to

2623
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
It's hard work I'm worth doing

2624
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,000
yes

2625
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Hello teacher, those two questions

2626
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:12,000
The first question is about the prediction of volcanic eruptions

2627
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
It's what you just mentioned

2628
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
If you try to predict a volcanic eruption

2629
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
We can see that it was before the earthquake

2630
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
It is possible to slowly change forward from a relatively deep place

2631
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Then but what I want to ask is

2632
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
The speed at which the magma is extruded from the ground

2633
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
how fast it can

2634
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
If a whole bunch of predictions today happen within two hours

2635
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Like what kind of hot spring water becomes hot?

2636
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:37,000
or place names

2637
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,000
just too helpless

2638
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
could it be in two hours

2639
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
maybe or within an hour

2640
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
It's all ordinary earthquakes

2641
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Then the water temperature of the hot springs and the like

2642
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Is it possible to have such a fast speed

2643
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,000
This is the first question

2644
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Excuse me

2645
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Then the second question is

2646
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
about that fire pot

2647
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
that's me in the magazine

2648
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
That is, there are three crater lakes in Africa.

2649
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Then what used to happen was

2650
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
It's the volcano under the crater lake.

2651
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
It's the gas that erupts and causes

2652
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
carbon dioxide in the lake

2653
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
What concentration is saturated or something like that?

2654
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
And then this carbon dioxide floats out of this lake

2655
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:23,000
and killed an entire village in one night

2656
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Then what I want to ask is

2657
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Is it possible for this to happen in Taiwan?

2658
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
because we just heard

2659
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,000
That is, Taiwan has submarine volcanoes.

2660
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
There are many hot springs I don't know

2661
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Is it because Taiwan has this condition that this kind of thing will happen?

2662
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
that's it thank you

2663
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
The first question is to say

2664
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,000
will it be one hour two hours

2665
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Suddenly the volcano erupts

2666
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,000
basically it should be hard

2667
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Because the magma actually moves its body

2668
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
It's actually very sticky

2669
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
it won't be like a bomb

2670
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Run from 5 kilometers to 10 kilometers to the surface in one go

2671
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
can't be that fast

2672
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,000
usually a few weeks

2673
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,880
months or even years

2674
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,720
it pants slowly

2675
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:07,240
So within a short period of time

2676
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:10,200
It should be theoretically not

2677
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:13,600
about crater lake

2678
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:14,800
Actually that's because

2679
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:16,920
It's a volcano full of camps

2680
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:18,360
there is a crater

2681
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:21,440
like a lake

2682
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:25,640
Then there will be a lot of water

2683
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:28,160
that volcanic gas

2684
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:29,800
In fact, a lot of acid

2685
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:32,640
And CO2 is the most

2686
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:34,160
There is also a lot of acid

2687
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:36,000
So these can easily become sour

2688
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,480
carbonic acid

2689
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:39,640
Of course for plant organisms

2690
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:41,760
Or animals actually have a lot of influence

2691
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:44,000
so you just have to be in crater lake

2692
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,520
if there is volcanic activity

2693
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:49,400
In fact, the water will become very acidic.

2694
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:50,400
will affect

2695
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:51,960
But under the sea

2696
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:53,240
This problem may be less

2697
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:56,400
Because the sea is water after all, it is big

2698
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:59,200
so it will be diluted

2699
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,320
but

2700
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
There is little water in the lake

2701
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,500
So it will be relatively high concentration

2702
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:05,500
will be more harmful

2703
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:06,700
The sea area probably

2704
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:09,500
Unless it happens to be in an undersea crater

2705
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:12,300
Creatures there may be affected

2706
01:55:12,300 --> 01:55:14,500
But it's easy to dilute

2707
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:20,500
There's another one here

2708
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:22,700
Hello teacher

2709
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:24,500
What about Datong Volcano?

2710
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:26,500
Our year with the Giant Volcano Society is

2711
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:28,500
The last climb was within a few thousand years

2712
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:30,000
then ask the teacher

2713
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,500
The year of the Volcano Society is

2714
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:33,500
probably what kind of method

2715
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,000
may the teacher explain

2716
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,500
volcano will it actually be

2717
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:40,500
There are many of them are simple to use

2718
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:42,000
carbon fourteen

2719
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
some of its half lives

2720
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
So many address fields use

2721
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
use half-life

2722
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,500
then it is a

2723
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,500
a decay it takes

2724
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:53,000
how many years then see if it is

2725
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,500
The ratio is attenuated several times

2726
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,000
then how many years

2727
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
It's probably like this for many years

2728
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
that's the place to use that half-life

2729
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,000
The half-life of course

2730
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Carbon stone is often used for thousands of years to ten thousand years

2731
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
But if it's hundreds of thousands of years or millions

2732
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,000
It has another life-releasing business that it can do

2733
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Make nails or teeth

2734
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,000
So they have professionals who are doing this

2735
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
yes

2736
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Do you have

2737
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,000
well here is the last one

2738
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
last question

2739
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,000
I just want to ask

2740
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
that pyroclastic

2741
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Can you predict the direction

2742
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
because at that time

2743
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Pompeii will be submerged by pyroclastic flow

2744
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
That is, it goes in that direction

2745
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
And then there's another

2746
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,000
neapolitan place

2747
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
if it's like taipei

2748
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Words distributed by Datong Volcano

2749
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
can we just be

2750
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
predict which direction it will go

2751
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Then we can avoid that disaster

2752
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
yes

2753
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
the answer is yes

2754
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
It's as simple as water

2755
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
you pour the water down

2756
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
it goes to the lowest flow

2757
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,000
In fact, for this, like Japan, especially Japan, a lot of work has been done.

2758
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:08,500
For example, he looked at the village, that, that, the ancient ground is the village

2759
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:10,000
then what do they do

2760
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
The taxes flowed down and rushed to the village

2761
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:17,000
They make something like this gutter or retaining wall

2762
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:23,000
It’s a bit like the concept of flood control, which is to be a very, very resolute body.

2763
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,000
When the tax flow comes to meet that body, he will turn the corner

2764
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
won't rush to the village

2765
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
So this can be predicted and pre-cast.

2766
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Then make some preparations for evacuation

2767
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
So Japan has done a lot in this regard

2768
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
yes

2769
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
good

2770
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
it's almost time

2771
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
i want to end

2772
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
uh bring back the preview

2773
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Our feast of knowledge next month in August

2774
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
by Chen Zhicheng

2775
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Institute of Biomedical Sciences

2776
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:55,000
What's the matter with soreness?

2777
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
So this is a life science subject

2778
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Let's Talk Slowly

2779
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,760
Human figure and acid receptor molecule

2780
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:06,600
before all of us are ready to leave

2781
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:09,280
Let's give another round of applause

2782
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,640
Thank you for the wonderful speech today

2783
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:13,240
good

2784
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:15,440
Thank you all for coming
