12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
thank you

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,560
This is September's Feast of Knowledge

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,400
This topic is very attractive

15
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,240
One topic is related to the history of medicine

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,340
I actually wanted to hear this

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,880
speech

18
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,960
It just so happened that our other vice president was in charge of this

19
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,000
Vice President Huang

20
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,320
He's abroad so he asked me to host

21
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,160
I am honored to be the host of this feast of knowledge

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,720
this time

23
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,300
The speaker is Dr. Lei Xianglin

24
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,580
he has very

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,160
unique background

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,720
It is

27
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,340
Associate Researcher of the Prohibition Institute in the Institute of Prohibition Institutes is also

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,660
Associate Professor at the Institute of Technology and Society, Yangming University

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,780
He graduated from the Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan University, and is also my alma mater and alma mater.

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,320
so he is

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,040
this is mine

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,600
Junior is equal to a generation

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Then at the University of Chicago he switched to history

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He also has a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Chicago

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The University of Chicago is also my alma mater

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Or my doctorate over there is also my junior

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So it's rare to have this background of chemistry and history

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But it's also about chemistry

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm a helper to learn chemistry Chemistry publicity

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Many of us in the courtyard are chemistry students

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Like the seniors or juniors in my past department

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't know in the life science group

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There are quite a few who used to be directors

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There are vice presidents

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But I'm honored for the first time

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Now one is from chemistry to history

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,660
published numerous articles

48
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,800
But one article worth mentioning is

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,200
Nilidonky No Horse Medicine in the struggle over China's modernity

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,200
published by the university

51
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,700
Published in 2014

52
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,960
This one once won the American Medical History Society class

53
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,460
William Welch Medal in 2016

54
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:28,300
Then I also won this award in the Humanities and Social Sciences Special Book Award of Academia Sinica

55
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:36,560
It was responsible for promoting the openness of Taiwan's science and technology and social academic network

56
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,400
this is a three year plan

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,860
From 2001 to 2004

58
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,060
The next long-term participation was initiated by Taiwanese scholars

59
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:51,300
The international academic journal edited by him is called East Asian Science Technology and Society

60
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,860
This is an International Journal

61
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,360
is published by Duke University

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,960
In 2016, this year began to take over the

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,920
Please warmly welcome the protagonist Dr. Lei

64
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,520
Thank you, Dean Dr. Lei, for your introduction

65
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,840
I would like to thank the hospital for giving me this opportunity to make this report with you

66
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,160
Of course, I would also like to thank everyone advanced

67
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,200
and colleagues and friends

68
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,240
After a day of hard work is over

69
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,280
Only dare to listen to this speech after get off work

70
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,640
When you see the topic of today's speech

71
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,400
It should be a bit of a surprise

72
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,840
Because these two topics and subtopics

73
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,520
Looks like it's only set to quite different things

74
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,600
The main title is the name of Du Congming's Chinese meaning to study

75
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,000
Seems like a very specific case

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,040
That is to say, of course it is Mr. Du Congming, who everyone knows

77
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,520
but only a very small part of his research

78
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,040
sounds like a very case study

79
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,440
But the subtitle Traditional Medicine and Modernity in East Asia

80
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,720
sounds like a big topic

81
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,880
and it seems to have a lot of meaning and probing

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,020
This is indeed a design for my speech today

83
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,220
I want to talk about a specific individual

84
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,720
Maybe many people will care

85
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,520
and has not been adequately answered

86
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,020
an issue that is debated even today

87
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,680
So maybe it is not the same as the goal of our knowledge experiment today.

88
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,840
What I share with you today is not so much knowledge

89
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,440
Of course there is knowledge

90
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,060
But to a greater extent, it may be to share with you

91
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,200
Questions that are still debated today

92
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
then please let me try first

93
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,960
Letâ€™s start from solving the big problem of the subtitle

94
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
The question I want to share with you today

95
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,920
What Vice President Liu said just now meant that

96
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,120
I graduated from the Department of Chemistry

97
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,360
indeed so

98
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,120
from a certain point of view

99
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,200
This is the issue that we are concerned about in this speech or my research

100
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,520
It's actually a very simple question.

101
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,520
It's a question that a chemistry student would also think of

102
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,400
That is to say, all kinds of traditional East Asian knowledge about nature

103
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
From 1900 to present

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,680
The world has been completely replaced by modern science

105
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,160
Why Only Traditional Medicine Is the Only Accident

106
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,280
exception

107
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,360
Why Chinese medicine is still active in our life today

108
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,800
and even spread back to the rest of the world

109
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,120
Come to think of it, this is indeed a rather strange phenomenon.

110
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,720
right

111
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,840
That is to say, a student who has never studied history

112
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,080
also start to feel curious

113
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,840
from a certain angle

114
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm a historian trying to answer

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,720
that is

116
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,720
what kind of historical process

117
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,040
This led to such a peculiar phenomenon

118
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,080
We want to know the course of history

119
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,720
more importantly i think

120
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,400
Many people here will care

121
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,040
What is the significance of this historical phenomenon

122
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,840
Does it mean that East Asia is still far behind?

123
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,480
Or does it mean there are other possibilities?

124
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,480
This should be a further question

125
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,760
that's my original

126
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,800
A naive question that I think everyone will agree on

127
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,120
But many simple questions that everyone cares about

128
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,200
Historians are unlikely to be able to solve

129
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,680
So I'm going to

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,320
Use two specific historical scenes to present a

131
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,600
A specific question that we are better able to answer than historians

132
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,520
The first of these two historical scenarios takes place in 1925

133
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,240
This is Dr. Sun Yat-sen trying at Union Hospital in Beijing.

134
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,360
Before he tried it, he already knew that liver cancer was incurable.

135
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,800
Then what about that time

136
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,640
Whether he should take traditional Chinese medicine before dying

137
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,120
become a matter of national concern

138
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,040
Everyone wants to know the one who overthrew the Qing Dynasty

139
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,480
leader of the revolution

140
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,240
Did he take Chinese medicine when he was weakest?

141
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,800
He himself has medical training

142
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,400
right

143
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,520
That means he was at his weakest at the end of his life

144
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,600
Abandoned what he believed in science and modernity

145
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,800
while taking traditional Chinese medicine

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,440
So the newspapers report every day

147
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,520
Let's see if he will give in

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,560
that was the situation

149
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,520
what about later

150
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,440
among those who care

151
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,880
Another Lu Xun who also studied medicine in Japan

152
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,000
After Sun Yat-sen passed away, he once wrote that

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,440
He once heard that Sun Yat-sen refused to take traditional Chinese medicine

154
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,740
In fact, Sun Yat-sen took Chinese medicine in the end

155
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,900
In addition, he was consigned to the Xiehe Hospital for taking traditional Chinese medicine.

156
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,560
Ask him to move out of the hospital before he can take Chinese medicine

157
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,860
But once Lu Xun heard that Sun Yat-sen refused to take traditional Chinese medicine

158
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,860
He said the news that Sun Yat-sen refused to take traditional Chinese medicine

159
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,740
No less than his lifetime revolutionary cause touched me

160
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,400
Even the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty has not moved him so much

161
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,340
He still doesn't take Chinese medicine at this time

162
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,140
That makes him feel really touched

163
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,140
So you can imagine that

164
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,940
at this point in time

165
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,640
Whether to take traditional Chinese medicine or not is not a small problem of personal health

166
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,240
Rather, it represents a major issue in the development of a country

167
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,940
so everyone will be very concerned

168
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,440
And Lu Xun gave him such a high importance

169
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,840
This is in 1925 and 1926

170
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,640
but after half a century

171
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,840
This meaning is almost reversed

172
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,440
still in the same hospital

173
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,240
Still at Peking Union Medical College Hospital

174
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,540
It's one that's heavily supported by the Rockefeller Foundation.

175
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,840
The most advanced hospital in East Asia at that time

176
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,040
that is very famous

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,900
Just to visit with Nixon

178
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,900
Interviewed by a New York Times reporter

179
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,300
James Reston

180
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,000
He had an operation and was admitted to this hospital

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,300
At that time the hospital had been renamed

182
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,800
Anti-land hospital

183
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,300
Then after he went in

184
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,700
Received some weeks of treatment during surgery

185
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,600
He found it very miraculous

186
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,000
He later interviewed some of the patients inside

187
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,100
And feel the amazing effect

188
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,200
So he was later in the New York Times

189
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,000
published an article

190
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,600
Where is the special article?

191
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,400
It also starts from today's special article

192
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,700
Only Americans have heard the term AcuPuncture

193
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,800
Syndromal fever

194
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,600
Well James Reston knows very well

195
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,500
how ironic this thing is

196
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
When the hospital was established

197
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,900
the Logefeller Foundation

198
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,100
In order to introduce the spirit of science into China

199
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,000
and built up

200
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,600
Unexpectedly, after receiving treatment here, he

201
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,100
And believe that China has created a

202
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,500
Symptoms unknown to other modern medicine

203
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,000
And combine the old medical treatment with the new

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
medical together

205
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,840
It seems that China has developed another

206
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,840
Effective medical treatment that the world does not know

207
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,080
To expand a little

208
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,000
It's like another kind of modernity

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
so it feels a strong irony

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,320
And this also triggered the whole

211
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,160
The real origins of the alternative medical craze

212
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,840
Then the two scenes I'm showing you now

213
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,440
50 years apart in the same hospital

214
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,480
Almost the entire Chinese medicine or traditional medicine

215
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,720
Relationship to Science and Relationship to Modernity

216
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,200
reversed

217
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,440
If in order to let everyone feel more deeply

218
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,320
How big is this reversal

219
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,880
Let's look at another gentleman's lecture

220
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,320
This is Fu Sinian, who once served as the president of National Taiwan University after the war

221
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,200
He said that I would not consult Chinese medicine even when I was dying.

222
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,320
I feel that if I don't, I'm sorry for my education.

223
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,560
So he has a very strong stance

224
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,520
And what's more

225
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,320
In 1934 he published an essay

226
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,960
He said

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,880
The most shameful, hateful and breathless thing in China now is

228
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,840
It's not a bandit exchange, it's not a foreign exchange

229
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,960
It should be the so-called dispute between Chinese and Western medicine

230
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
This is almost the same as what Lu Xun said

231
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,480
At that time, the Northeast was completely occupied by the prison army.

232
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,720
But he thinks it's more shameful than such a foreign exchange

233
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,720
There is still the so-called dispute between Chinese and Western medicine

234
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,160
he said why

235
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,600
Because they think they are advocating waiting

236
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,000
common sense of science

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,800
still in chaos

238
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,800
let alone more complicated things

239
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,440
To this day, I still come there to compete for Chinese and Western medicine

240
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,840
Wouldn't it make people all over the world think that the Chinese are a kind of human beings from another world?

241
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,680
The school that has been in operation for 40 years still cannot break away from this medieval stage

242
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,800
Doesn't it make people feel that the future of education is still the same

243
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,640
he said very serious things

244
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,760
Especially here is a special mention of waiting

245
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,200
is what I call the concept of modernity

246
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,960
then i want here

247
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,000
Here you can in this seemingly simple sentence

248
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,120
Actually there are many

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I explained why the discussion on China and the West was so important at that time

250
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
An important matter that is not allowed to be decided by individuals

251
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
because it actually touches on a debate about modernity

252
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
How should I put it, we just looked at, for example, the first element

253
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The meaning of modernity basically means that

254
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We determine Europe's experience in modern development

255
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And there seems to be a general trend

256
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
feel that all people in the world

257
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Feel like the whole world is going the same way

258
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Everybody's heading for the nation-state, capitalism, the industrial revolution

259
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
even the acceptance of science and so on

260
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Therefore, in this universal direction of common development

261
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
If you still have to develop another contingency alone

262
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's as if you've become different from everyone else

263
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Not in line with the trend of universal development

264
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Second, if you are really different from others

265
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Your difference is not what we call multiculturalism today

266
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Different cultures have different values

267
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,880
People will tell you that what you're talking about is familiar to me

268
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,600
Just a few hundred years ago we were in the medieval stage

269
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,280
We advocate the same medicine during the dark period

270
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,360
So this difference is not considered a value

271
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,200
Instead it would clearly be seen as a previous period in history

272
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,840
And going a step further

273
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,240
This why is that in such a European experience

274
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,000
they will get the perception

275
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,560
Some even Europeans feel

276
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,040
Developments from the 17th century are not just new phases of history

277
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,440
is an unprecedented stage

278
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,400
We know the truth about the world like never before

279
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,560
That is to say, it is completely different from the past

280
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,880
In this sense, the most representative

281
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,720
It's modern science

282
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,120
Wait until our Newtonian almanac, wait until the Newtonian almanac is invented

283
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,320
We don't feel like we're just entering a new phase

284
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,440
It's the feeling that everyone in the past was wrong

285
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,480
We know the truth about nature like never before

286
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,000
and thus bring us to the front

287
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,300
premodern people were completely different

288
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,800
So from this point of view

289
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,700
In fact, science has been around throughout our modern history

290
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,700
My research unit is modern history

291
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,000
it has a very special meaning

292
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That is to say, if we talk about the political system

293
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,500
female role

294
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,000
In other words, the relationship between the state, politics and religion

295
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,500
If there is room for debate among cultures

296
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,500
It shouldn't be hard for everyone to question

297
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Science has the highest generality

298
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
And we clearly see the progress of science

299
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and we clearly see

300
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There is a very big break between science and the past

301
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
In the past, not only China had traditional Chinese medicine

302
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The West also has their traditional Greek medicine

303
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,500
But those can be completely given up

304
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,000
without any hesitation

305
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,500
we know those are wrong

306
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
Those have only historical value

307
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,000
So from this point of view

308
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,500
science as modernity

309
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
That is to say that science makes us feel most clearly

310
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,000
developed in Europe

311
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Many of these systems have developed

312
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
is of universal value

313
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,400
And it deserves a system that the people embrace from a new perspective

314
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,840
So from this point of view

315
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,640
Original European Modern History Experience

316
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,720
It is no longer just a historical experience

317
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,280
and became a normative concept

318
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,520
or in this era

319
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,880
Some would say the concept of civilization

320
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,160
people of other nationalities

321
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,320
There is no need to examine their

322
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,000
Every part of historical and cultural knowledge

323
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,640
you know you should start with

324
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,520
Europe's historical experience and development direction

325
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,240
as a development direction

326
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,800
because that's the way to go

327
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,400
So from this point of view

328
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,280
you can see

329
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,640
in this sense

330
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,400
Just now Fu Sinian would feel

331
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,080
The Importance of Discussion about China and the West

332
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,080
Because suppose once you admit

333
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,320
you are in east asia

334
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,840
your whole european experience

335
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,160
they all give up their own

336
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,920
Pre-Modern Medical Cases

337
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,640
and you read the same

338
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,040
keep another

339
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,000
self-proclaimed scientific medicine

340
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
make you different from the whole world

341
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,300
It seems to mean that there are many different possibilities for the development of this world

342
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,000
right

343
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's what Fu Sinian said

344
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,500
If you can't even distinguish such a clear thing

345
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,000
As for the development of other political aspects of society

346
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
There will be countless debates that can take place

347
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
so for them

348
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's a matter of life and death

349
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's why there was so much debate

350
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But at that time, in order to ask questions about Chinese medicine

351
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
triggering the resignation of the chief executive at the time

352
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So it should be regarded as the truth of nuclear four in the 1920s and 2030s.

353
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
At that time, this was a very political theory

354
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So from this point of view

355
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I started from Su Pu's question just now

356
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
When I turn this question into a specific historical question

357
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
we can say

358
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It is how Chinese medicine has developed within half a century

359
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
sworn enemy of modernity

360
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
what we think must be excluded

361
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and transformed into Chinese exploration and modernity

362
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,560
The most concrete symbols and tools

363
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,140
That's what I was going to ask

364
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,960
And one of my specific historical questions

365
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,260
It's also what Vice President Liu just mentioned

366
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,320
I'm writing a book about it

367
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,360
The Chinese name is "Fei Aluminum Fei Ma"

368
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,920
Medicine and China's Modernity Controversy"

369
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,200
But what?

370
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,240
I don't want to come with you today

371
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,780
talk about the content of this book

372
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,340
On the one hand, there is no way to do it in one speech.

373
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,620
on the other hand

374
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,700
So I want to change a perspective to share with you

375
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,460
possible problems in this history

376
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,780
And I hope you feel that in this history

377
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,780
Contains more complex issues than we originally thought

378
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,620
still interesting

379
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,380
but also

380
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,180
still under debate

381
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,220
And it's worth taking a serious look at him

382
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:43,980
That

383
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,540
This brings me to the main title of my speech today

384
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,820
it is me

385
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,100
i started from a

386
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,160
related but otherwise distinct context

387
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,480
It is the context of Mr. Du Congming

388
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,560
To answer the historical development just now

389
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,580
The problem

390
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,100
Mr. Du Congming, everyone should be the most familiar scientist

391
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,900
He Taiwan's first doctor of medicine

392
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,100
The first and third term of National Taiwan University School of Medicine

393
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,100
The third dean

394
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,100
And founded Kaohsiung Medical College

395
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,300
on my story

396
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,600
he has a very important

397
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
an effort

398
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,100
It was him from 1928 to 1929

399
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,600
Published an investigation on the research methods of Chinese Medicine

400
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,600
At that time he had just returned to Taiwan

401
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,200
The legend says that he built a Han medicine hospital

402
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,500
and cause a

403
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
Than Mr. Qiyuan criticized him

404
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,500
As a result, Mr. Du was published in Taiwan Ming Pao

405
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,900
Published 31 texts

406
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,400
like this

407
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,100
Then a total of 31 articles were published in half a year

408
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,800
Then there are a total of 60,000 words

409
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,100
So it's hard for everyone to imagine now

410
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,900
is you in a

411
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,500
Detailed scientific debate published in major large newspapers

412
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,400
It talks about a lot of history of science, chemical terms, etc.

413
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,300
But it took half a year

414
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,300
Just one of mine is very important today

415
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,900
The topics I will share with you later

416
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,740
It's from this article

417
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,900
that's not only it

418
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,580
And Mr. Du Congming

419
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,420
What about during the Japanese occupation and after the war?

420
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,140
Twice established Chinese medicine hospital

421
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,420
The first time was from 1928 to 1929 as I just said

422
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,220
The second time was 1946, soon after the war

423
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,340
And it was not approved twice

424
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,820
and the second time

425
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,380
It was after changing the principal after 228

426
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,780
It should be Mr. Fu Sinian who put this

427
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,380
To set up the program of Chinese Medicine Therapy Department

428
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,620
canceled

429
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,380
Then what about Du Congming

430
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,820
He also wanted to promote research in this area after the war

431
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,580
Not only during the Japanese occupation period

432
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,820
He said I was in Taipei City University and National Taiwan University School of Medicine

433
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,780
For 20 years, I have taught students the history of traditional Chinese medicine

434
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,820
Pharmacology of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Shanghan Theory

435
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,100
make students get an idea

436
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,260
I hope they can read Chinese medicine books

437
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,780
But recently, the Academic Affairs Office of National Taiwan University School of Medicine told me

438
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,580
I don't have time, I can't schedule this class

439
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,660
So I terminate this handout

440
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,060
I created Kaohsiung Hospital by myself

441
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm going to teach in it myself

442
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,320
Later he created Gao Yi

443
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,440
he did teach

444
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,440
Also published several books

445
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,440
So we can see that

446
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,940
his insistence on the matter

447
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,940
It's actually a lot of effort

448
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,440
And many friends also know

449
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,940
He has three famous studies

450
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,940
Regarding opium snake venom and traditional Chinese medicine

451
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,600
right

452
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,100
Then this is the famous third item

453
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,440
So from this point of view

454
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,440
I mentioned this to you

455
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,440
The secret of Chinese medicine research means

456
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Du Congming, the leader of medical modernity in Taiwan

457
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,540
Why do you support the pre-modern for a long time

458
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,040
Traditional East Asian Medicine

459
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Now Mr. Du Congming's book

460
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
We have a lot of books in Cobo

461
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
But it seems that few of us come to discuss

462
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,540
this problem

463
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,040
and more importantly

464
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,540
not only he supports

465
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,540
And his career is on his shoulders

466
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,540
persistently viewed as outdated

467
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,040
acts against science

468
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,040
And because of this midterm he never had the means to build

469
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,140
The Han medicine he wants to establish

470
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,500
So this is what I call today

471
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Du Congming is well-known for his research on traditional Chinese medicine

472
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Then I try to share with you

473
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,500
I mean why on earth would he want to do this?

474
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,500
That is the main axis of my report to you below.

475
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,500
I'll take off my coat then. I'm sorry.

476
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I hope you all find this to be a puzzle.

477
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
In this case, everyone will look forward to hearing some answers.

478
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
well that

479
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The simplest way is to say

480
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Let's start from just now and let me explain his example a little bit

481
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
From the concept of modernity we just talked about

482
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Well, in terms of the current concept

483
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
This is the example we just mentioned

484
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
In terms of the concept of modernity we just talked about

485
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,600
In fact, you are interested in pre-modern things

486
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,300
Pre-Modern should be able to raise without hesitation

487
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,200
right

488
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,400
So from this point of view

489
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,200
It should be clear that people can be divided into

490
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,300
Modern Science and Traditional Conservation

491
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,800
So we just looked at, say, from

492
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,900
Cong Sun Yat-sen Lu Xun Fu Sinian

493
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,200
They all think they are on the side of the modern

494
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,500
But if we compare modernity and science

495
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,800
They should be far behind Du Congming

496
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,600
right

497
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,900
In terms of his academic qualifications

498
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,100
They should be much worse than Du Congming

499
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,800
puzzling is to say

500
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,500
Du Congming seems to have adopted a

501
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,600
Viewed as a pro-traditional medical stance, at least at the time

502
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,900
So from this point of view

503
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,800
Let's not talk about the answer to this mystery now

504
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,000
The case of Du Congming is very worthy of our careful consideration

505
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,900
Because it's actually pretty easy for us to find other supportive people

506
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,300
But if other supporters previously

507
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,300
we can easily say

508
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,800
they have no scientific mind

509
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,200
they have a vested interest

510
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,700
or they themselves have no science

511
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,100
do not understand

512
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,640
Science right?

513
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,800
But Du Congming, you can't say that about him

514
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,440
So from this point of view

515
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,000
His case exemplifies a very large

516
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,200
combine two irreconcilable elements

517
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,880
thus presenting a great deal of inner tension and creativity

518
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,040
So before I solve the problem

519
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,160
I hope you can feel

520
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,960
an inherently interesting aspect of the matter

521
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,240
But if we think about it further

522
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,040
How to understand Du Congming

523
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,040
when i was doing research in the city

524
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,480
I think of what a friend told me

525
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,480
At that time, Taipei 101 was the tallest building in the world.

526
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,960
Then this friend is a foreign friend

527
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,200
he told me

528
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,480
But it doesn't seem to feel

529
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,520
He is the tallest building in the world

530
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,120
Later he told me that the reason was because

531
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,360
There are no other tall buildings nearby

532
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,920
so if you go to new york

533
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,640
You see the so-called sports building first

534
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,720
That's 1901 high

535
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,200
you can compare one by one

536
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,320
Do you know how tall that building is?

537
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,880
If there are no other tall buildings next to Taipei 101

538
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,820
You can't see the uniqueness of this building

539
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,100
where is he high

540
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,560
So from this point of view

541
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,420
Thanks to this long article by Du Congming

542
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,220
Long essays up to 60,000 words

543
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,720
It should be the entire Japanese occupation period

544
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,220
even postwar Taiwan

545
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,700
rare heavyweight scientist

546
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,620
An important document for Chinese medicine and Chinese medicine

547
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,460
so for me

548
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,000
A big challenge is to say

549
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,560
How do I find points to compare

550
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,340
so that we can compare

551
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,660
His uniqueness and where his ideas lie

552
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,720
So the middle part of the speech below

553
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,920
all i want to do is

554
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,560
I want to put it in multiple historical contexts

555
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,520
Let everyone understand his possible uniqueness

556
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,960
The first is to put it in Japan

557
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,480
In the context of Japan

558
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,080
The second is to put it in the context of Chinese and Western theory of truth in the period of the Republic of China

559
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,380
just mentioned

560
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,040
Third I'm going to put it in

561
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,240
In the context of the development of Western medical history

562
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,680
Especially an experimental therapeutic novelty

563
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,580
Another Chinese medicine hospital that he mentioned

564
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,520
finally i called juicing

565
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
There is a very clever research method

566
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
There is also a very unique place

567
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I call it the reverse method of research

568
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Later I will explain from these five directions

569
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
its special place

570
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
The first is Japanese

571
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
modernity with hygiene

572
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
many friends know

573
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Japan began to accept the West

574
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
The starting point of Western scientific case knowledge

575
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Anatomy of Genpaku Mita

576
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The right one he can't understand at all

577
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Dutch Anatomy Book Anatomy

578
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The structure of the human body as taught by Chinese medicine

579
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's all wrong, right?

580
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So he started working hard to learn Dutch

581
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Then translate this book into Japanese

582
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It becomes the dismantling new book

583
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
This also became the starting point for the Japanese to become interested in blue studies

584
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Published in 191774

585
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
this is a very early period

586
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And let's just talk about it

587
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
know Japan's experience in medicine and medical science

588
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
In contrast to China

589
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So in the Opium War

590
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,640
Didn't China's self-improvement movement also start to introduce blood sucking?

591
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,120
But at that time they didn't think

592
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,920
Medicine is a particularly important science

593
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,840
In fact China began to accept medical

594
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,400
Far more than it accepts chemistry, mining and other knowledge

595
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
until the beginning of the 20th century

596
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,640
Manchuria became a transfer point only after it belonged

597
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,760
So from this point of view

598
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,360
Japan's acceptance of blood-sucking experience is in sharp contrast with China

599
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,720
The starting point of Japan is related to medical anatomy

600
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,680
And later the Japanese enlightenment master Fukuzawa Yukichi

601
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,920
The school he himself originally attended was also the school run by Lan Yi.

602
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,760
If you read his biography now,

603
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,840
You'll see him with the students who were there at the time

604
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,160
Let's take the opportunity to look forward to the former Han doctor

605
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,160
I think they are very unscientific and outdated

606
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,360
in other words

607
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,200
Contemporary Japanese Enlightenment Master

608
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,760
his own enlightenment experience

609
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,600
It's just that traditional medicine is wrong

610
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,360
should be discarded

611
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,520
And the more progressive development of this meaning

612
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,160
That is to say, to become not only

613
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,220
It became an important part of Japan's self-belief that it entered the modern era later.

614
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:10,820
Medicine has become an important way for Japan to successfully join the West and modern times

615
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:16,680
And it also became a later combined with the colonial policy

616
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,100
This is a classic work of our Asian studies

617
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,060
hygienic modernity

618
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,940
It is pointed out in this work

619
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,220
It later became the core strategy of Japan's colonial expansion to Korea, Manchuria, Taiwan and China

620
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:33,340
is not only a core experience of Japan

621
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,360
And it became an important means of later colonial expansion

622
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,140
so that we later heard that

623
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,760
Goto Shinpei

624
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,340
It is also one of the very important promoters

625
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,500
Then wrote the National Sanitation Principles

626
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,740
It is also the close connection between medical care and hygiene

627
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,220
Closely integrated with the governance of the country and colonial governance

628
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,020
And this is actually felt by people in the colonies

629
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,980
So on New Year's Day in 1925, Taiwan's Ming Pao editorial

630
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
After 30 years of Japanese occupation, he said

631
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
We are now looking back at the achievements of the Governor-General in the past 30 years

632
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Our most commendable from beginning to end

633
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's about sanitary facilities.

634
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
So from this point of view

635
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
This is a stronger

636
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That is to say, Du Congming is in the context of Japan

637
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
should be more strongly affirmed

638
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Western Medicine and Hygiene

639
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And it's of very high importance to his

640
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Du Congming is indeed so

641
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
He himself is not only a product of this

642
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And therefore he thinks that

643
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
implemented in Taiwan

644
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
The Doctrine that Let Han Physicians Dissolve Naturally

645
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It is a policy that is extremely adapted to the requirements of the times

646
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
He is sure of this policy

647
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
That Japanese

648
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Part of Modern Medicine and Hygiene

649
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You may be more familiar

650
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
What you may not be familiar with is that

651
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
What about the other side?

652
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Beginning to recognize in modern Japan

653
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
While Dr. Han was wrong

654
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
But they have a

655
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
very different history

656
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,900
Only recently came out two recent books stating that

657
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,360
After Materia Medica Okaki was introduced to Japan

658
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,400
Indeed Japan developed very close to modern natural history

659
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,560
Natural History

660
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,400
Darwin was a natural history scholar, right?

661
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,000
That is to say, beyond the tradition of traditional herbal medicine

662
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,400
And the beginning equals that Japan is somewhat self-sufficient

663
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,000
developed a research tradition close to a natural history like Darwin's

664
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,200
and developed a realistic image

665
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,800
That is to say, so at that time it was

666
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Just like the pictures on the poster I gave you today, there are many

667
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Everyone knows that the picture of Materia Medica Okagi does not have marble needles attached at all.

668
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,700
As far as the picture is concerned with Materia Medica, it has always been very crude

669
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,500
But we see very beautifully in the Japanese tradition

670
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,400
very close to our modern graph

671
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,200
And this is combined with realism

672
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,900
Then this becomes a very important self-identity in the development of Japanese science

673
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,000
It is through this that they are almost independent

674
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,280
independently developed their scientific traditions

675
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,480
and not only in natural history

676
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,640
Later, this herbal tradition means

677
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,940
Changjing Changyi

678
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,120
It is the founder of modern Japanese medicine

679
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,280
That's also the discoverer of ephedrine.

680
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,760
So it is equal to this one of the University of Tokyo, Japan

681
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,620
Founder of the Department of Pharmacy

682
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,560
He is based on the research on crude drugs of Chinese medicine

683
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,320
And he was the one who extracted the ephedrine first.

684
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
That

685
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,160
Du Congming himself studied at Kyoto University

686
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,440
also a doctor of pharmacy

687
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,640
His teacher is also a master of pharmacy

688
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,400
So all this means

689
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,040
After combining with this herbal medicine in Japan

690
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,800
developed not a total negation

691
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,560
But on Materia Medica and modern science

692
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
have a deep bond

693
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,240
So Du Congming said

694
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,440
Japan since the Meiji Restoration

695
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,440
Scientific research on the crude drugs of Galaxy

696
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,440
Make the greatest contribution to the world

697
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,360
So everyone hear here

698
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,720
might feel like saying

699
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,200
Du Congming's words sound like

700
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,960
very simple

701
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,500
But in fact, this sentence means more than we

702
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
than he said

703
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
He is too humble

704
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,500
Because it sounds like you might just think that

705
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,500
Japanese for Materia Medical

706
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,000
Herbal research is better

707
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,500
So just contribute the most in the world

708
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,000
Not only that

709
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,500
When it comes to the era we are talking about now

710
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,000
In fact, modern western medicine

711
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,500
don't think at all

712
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,000
in traditional herbal

713
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,500
can find something worth researching

714
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
and it starts early

715
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
The one on the left is a professor at Harvard University

716
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,500
professor of medicine

717
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
In 1870 he said

718
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
If we take all Materia Medical

719
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,000
If you throw them all into the sea

720
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
humanity has nothing to lose

721
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It just might kill the fish

722
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,500
In other words, Materia Medica

723
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,500
no research value at all

724
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,000
the man on the right

725
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
This is what it was like in 1870

726
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,500
By 1924

727
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,000
This man's name is John Grant

728
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
he is beijing

729
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,400
Founder of Public Health Department of Xiehe Hospital

730
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,600
Often referred to as the father of public health in China

731
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,300
He is also a famous hero in public health

732
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,300
That is to say, it affects later

733
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,100
that

734
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,800
Let me not go too far

735
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,300
He was sent to Union Hospital

736
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,200
When sent by Rockefeller's foundation to visit Japan

737
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,800
He saw that Chinese medicine research is being done everywhere in Japan

738
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,500
He felt very backward

739
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,400
Then criticize the study

740
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,700
That's why I want to tell you that

741
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,100
If we take time back to this era

742
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,500
What Du Congming said

743
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,100
is too modest a statement

744
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,200
As far as Japan was not only affected by Japan at that time

745
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,700
The influence of German pharmacy

746
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,300
make a great contribution

747
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,200
And this contribution was at the time

748
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,000
From an American point of view

749
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,100
It's an outdated and weird one at all.

750
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,500
Why do you remember to study this

751
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
worthless research

752
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,000
and therefore

753
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,200
So like I just told you

754
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,800
When we arrived at Peking Union Medical College Hospital

755
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,400
What about the Union Hospital at that time?

756
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,800
just to say

757
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,100
I'm going to show you the Union Hospital

758
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,700
Now it was called John Hopkins in China

759
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,500
Rockefeller's Foundation

760
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,540
to make a concrete proof

761
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,800
building a genetic body

762
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,500
Let you know what is scientific research

763
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,700
So everything is a parody of John Hopkins

764
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,700
only two things are not

765
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,300
one thing is his roof

766
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,300
that is, they feel

767
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,700
since here

768
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,000
I can't teach you everything

769
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,300
to show my respect for you

770
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,900
That's why we put a Chinese roof

771
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,900
Then this became the later

772
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,700
Characteristics of Chinese Modern Architecture

773
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,800
Now you go to Beijing and see a lot of big roofs

774
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,700
And many people now feel that this is very

775
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,800
What is not ideal is related to this development system

776
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,400
Another Rockefeller Foundation

777
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,700
There was a lot of internal debate at the time

778
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,900
is whether they want to set up a

779
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,100
Department of Pharmacy to study Materia Medica

780
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,700
Which means they are very reluctant to do this research

781
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,300
but they say they come here

782
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,800
Everyone says they think there's a gold mine in there.

783
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,100
So there's a really big debate among them

784
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,500
everyone can know

785
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,900
You can imagine what Du Congming said just now.

786
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,000
What a unique situation at the time

787
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Definitely not to say that everyone is researching

788
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,500
And very important is a unique influence of Japan

789
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,000
Then some interesting history developed here.

790
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,500
But I don't want to go far

791
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
I just want to come back and say something

792
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,500
I do an interpreted result

793
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,500
Explain that some friends will think that

794
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
what you say

795
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,000
you've solved it

796
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It is Du Congming who can do research and medicine

797
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Just because it's a product of Japanese tradition, right?

798
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Do you feel this way

799
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
largely

800
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
but if so you can't explain

801
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Then why does it suggest

802
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
The Governor's Palace has never accepted it, right?

803
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
so I largely

804
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
What I want to say in this paragraph is to say

805
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,500
to a very large extent

806
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,000
Du Congming proposed this research

807
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It is indeed a product of Japan

808
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
and at the time

809
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
is a very unique research tradition

810
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
But our riddle isn't over yet

811
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
because if so

812
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
what he does is he is

813
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Easy to learn with the scene

814
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
it's him

815
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,300
words learned in college

816
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,600
That's no reason why he can't continue in Taiwan

817
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,300
right

818
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,000
So I haven't solved my name yet

819
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,400
then I'll go to another place first

820
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,600
Said to put him in the second vein

821
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,400
That's the one

822
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,700
On the Truth between China and the West in the Republic of China

823
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,900
A very in the period of the Republic of China

824
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,300
Very comparable to Du Congming

825
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,800
He is the super sinner in the history of Chinese medicine

826
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,200
Is Yu Yan

827
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,100
This man is a graduate of a university in Osaka

828
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,200
Then in 1929 when he

829
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,200
It was the first committee of the National Government to establish the Ministry of Health.

830
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,800
Raise waste paper for medical treatment

831
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,200
To remove obstacles to medical hygiene

832
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,000
like this case

833
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,200
Very big teacher plagiarized Japan

834
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,600
Just to waste paper traditional medical treatment

835
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,000
detonated the theory of truth between China and the West

836
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,800
wait until after 1949

837
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,600
that is

838
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,500
because of this whole thing

839
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,400
he plays a very important role

840
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,300
So after 1949

841
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,700
After Mao Zedong began to support Chinese medicine

842
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,700
TCM Policy During the Nationalist Government Period

843
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,200
are called an oppressive Chinese medicine

844
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Pneumonia Pneumonia Pneumonia Drug Storage Policy

845
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So he alone represents the entire force of oppression

846
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
so this is a

847
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
People who are often mentioned in the history of modern Chinese medicine

848
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Then he and Du Congming actually have a lot of similarities

849
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
They also study in Japan

850
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And there are people in Japan

851
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Du Congming's memoir video mentioned more than once

852
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
pneumonia

853
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And then they also advocate the study of medical history

854
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And almost at the same time sparked debates about traditional medicine

855
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Du Congming was from 1928 to 1929

856
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Fisherman is the spring of 1929

857
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
They also oppose the theory of Yin-Yang and Five Elements

858
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and both advocate the scientific approach to the study of traditional medicines

859
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
As you can imagine, it's only natural

860
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Based on the Japanese tradition I just mentioned, right?

861
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
But there is one big difference between the two

862
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It is the fisherman who advocates the preservation of lung medicine

863
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
and the fisherman said

864
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
During the Republic of China

865
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
People who are eligible for research do not want to study traditional Chinese medicine

866
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
why

867
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
because

868
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
If we follow the American tradition we just talked about

869
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Nogfi's genetic society is unwilling to try to study it

870
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,760
Then you're a really top-notch trained man

871
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,940
Why study this one people think is a Dying Science

872
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,720
right

873
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,440
So everyone is unwilling to study

874
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,560
However, many Chinese medicine practitioners say that they need to study

875
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,600
But they don't have a laboratory at all, they don't have the ability

876
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,560
They are not eligible for research

877
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,320
That's what Yu Yan said

878
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,800
From this point of view

879
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,200
Du Congming constitutes an exception to what Yu Yan said

880
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,720
Du Congming undoubtedly has the qualifications for research

881
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,880
And he is serious about studying traditional Chinese medicine

882
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,080
Not only does he want to study traditional Chinese medicine, but also his research methods

883
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,800
It's not about saving money

884
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,560
Have a public talk with Du Congming

885
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,880
I am a pharmacologist

886
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,760
Mainly, of course, drug research

887
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,400
It's just that this plan also hopes to consider

888
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,320
systematically carry out non-pharmacological

889
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,480
Research on Chinese Medicine

890
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,800
And it is also surprising to say that

891
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,400
The words written by Du Congming are often very

892
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,880
The step-by-step writing method that reveals the truth

893
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,920
But he would jump out and say

894
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,800
I dare not say anything about the advantages and disadvantages of Chinese medicine and Western medicine

895
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,200
only in the case of bone setting

896
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,880
I dare say bone setting is much greater than western surgery

897
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,440
So Du Congming seems to be interested in Chinese medicine, including bone setting and snake medicine

898
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,200
a lot of further knowledge, right?

899
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,400
So from this perspective, it is quite different from the language.

900
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,240
Now let me come back to the unresolved issue I just said about Japanese tradition

901
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,200
I said he is very much a product of Japanese tradition

902
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,400
But if that's the case, we can't understand

903
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,000
Why has his ambition never been supported?

904
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,800
That's because in that sense

905
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,400
Not a product of Japanese tradition

906
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,600
To the third one, I will talk about the development of modern medicine, experimental therapeutics

907
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,600
Du Congming in 1928

908
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,800
After he was sent by the Governor's Mansion to study in Europe and the United States for two years and four months, he came back

909
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,800
Written by European and American medical inspection talks

910
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,400
He just talked about the results of his study tours in various places over the past two years.

911
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,800
He found that therapeutics is an independent lecture in universities in Europe and America

912
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,600
80% especially in France

913
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,200
But in Japanese therapeutics

914
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,400
no individual lectures yet

915
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,600
So when I say it, everyone thinks it's weird

916
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,600
In fact, the Japanese medical system

917
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,400
Take Xi, Japan and Germany as a model

918
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,900
Only import the unique German medical tourism

919
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,800
Therapeutic lectures that the French system says are very progressive

920
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,900
no

921
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,500
So from this point of view

922
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Du Congming, he is now going to propose

923
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,100
When experimental therapeutics is used to study Chinese medicine

924
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,500
It was not a natural extension of his studies at Kyoto University

925
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,100
but his newly learned

926
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,500
Newly learned what I just learned in Europe and the United States

927
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,100
The result of hitting the oil

928
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,800
And we can see clearly from where he hit the oil

929
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,300
because the founder of experimental therapeutics

930
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,700
Rockford

931
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,700
Chair of the Department of Pharmacy at John S. Hopkins University

932
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,400
He organized the American

933
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,400
Society of Pharmacy and Experimental Therapeutics in 1908

934
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,200
Du Congming used to go to his laboratory when he hit oil

935
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,000
and say

936
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,500
This is one of the three American scientists he most admires

937
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,300
so from here

938
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,200
Everyone read his article

939
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,700
In fact, he repeatedly proposed that experimental therapeutics

940
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,460
Rather than talk about medicine in general

941
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,960
Not about animal experiments, not about chemical research

942
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,960
It is about experimental therapeutics combined with clinical human research

943
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,960
So it's not about him

944
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,960
Achievements of Learning at Kyoto University

945
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,460
And, wait until he is going back to Taiwan

946
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,960
He just wrote that he thought of two things that could be done with experimental therapeutics

947
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,460
Study available in Taiwan

948
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,960
One is the de-addiction treatment of duck slices

949
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,960
The second is the experimental therapeutics of traditional Chinese medicine

950
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,960
So neither of those are direct extensions of his training in Japan.

951
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,460
And we can see that that is

952
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,960
Two of his three famous studies relate to his latest learning

953
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,960
Experimental Therapeutics Related

954
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,460
And he is and we can see from today

955
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:45,460
He advocated this study

956
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,460
Not only for the study of traditional Chinese medicine

957
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,460
to promote new research methods

958
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,460
He is also for the development of experimental therapeutics in Taiwan

959
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,960
Development of therapeutics that did not exist in the Empire of Japan at that time

960
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,960
and self-transformation as an experimental therapist

961
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,960
away from what he was supposed to learn

962
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,200
It is only because of his identity as a scholar that he deliberately chooses research topics with local advantages

963
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,000
So what is his choice?

964
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,200
It's actually a two-way

965
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,500
On the one hand, he chooses one that he thinks will be useful for research

966
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,300
Research methods of traditional Chinese medicine

967
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,500
his new method

968
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,100
On the other hand, this theme with local advantages

969
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,500
Because Westerners don't come to do research like this, right?

970
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,000
so be him again

971
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,300
Became a force for him to introduce the experimental therapy case and transform himself into an experimental therapist

972
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,200
So this chooses this two-way

973
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,800
Not only for Chinese medicine but also for the development of science

974
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,900
Well everyone knows that

975
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,900
Du Congming imagined that he would return to Taiwan to do two things

976
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,800
Then there was a completely different development

977
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:43,800
one is

978
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,300
Taiwan's Governor's Office was criticized by the Taiwan People's Party for the Japanese policy of duck slices

979
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,400
Quickly accepted Du Congming's idea

980
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,900
Established the Taiwan Roots Institute of the Governor-General of Taiwan

981
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,200
So he used experimental therapeutics to do the duck filming thing

982
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,500
Immediately paid to achieve

983
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,000
From the time he wrote this article

984
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
in less than a year

985
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,200
another one

986
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,600
Another one is to say

987
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,400
It has never been possible to study sweat medicine

988
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,000
took a completely different path

989
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,800
So from this point of view

990
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,200
You can now see a

991
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,200
develop

992
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,400
and not just to study a new discipline

993
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Du Congming also said to establish a new research institute

994
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,200
khan medical hospital

995
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,000
That's what I said at the time

996
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,000
the harshest criticism of his critics

997
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,000
He said

998
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,000
this must be evil

999
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,400
If you want to study sweat medicine

1000
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,200
sweat medicine

1001
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,800
Then continue the original research method

1002
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,800
You just need to set up a pharmacology lab

1003
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,400
right

1004
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,200
conduct animal experiments

1005
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,200
why do you want a hospital

1006
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,600
Since you want a hospital

1007
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,600
That must be hoping to rebuild a

1008
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,600
The two medical systems that confront each other between Khan and current medical care

1009
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,000
So this is one of his biggest criticisms

1010
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,600
But from Du Congming's point of view

1011
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,400
That's what he learned by crashing

1012
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,200
and reflects what other people don't understand

1013
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,200
his heart

1014
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,000
Khan Medical Research Hospital

1015
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,400
Primarily a research institution

1016
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,260
Twenty beds will basically witness the specific kind of patients we need for our experimental therapy class research

1017
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,160
do not accept any patients

1018
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,500
In fact, you can tell from his physical experience

1019
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,580
This is the same as when he was at the Rockefeller Institut in New York at the time

1020
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:20,700
Met the famous Japanese scientist Hideshi Noguchi who had a close relationship

1021
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,700
where the host of the rockefeller institute

1022
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,580
Create the Rockefeller Institut as a new research institution

1023
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,380
According to a medical historian

1024
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,820
At a time when most hospitals in the United States are still trying to get basic lab facilities

1025
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:39,120
Simon Flexner is the director of the Rockefeller Genetic Society

1026
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,680
presents an almost utopian vision

1027
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,320
Ultimately a hospital is a laboratory

1028
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,520
So the criticism of Du Congming just originated

1029
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,780
In fact, it happened to be what Du Congming wanted to surpass.

1030
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:53,580
He established a will with the goal of research

1031
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,080
The two are one and two two are one

1032
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,320
Then Du Congming said, I know none of you have heard of it.

1033
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,060
But this kind of hospital

1034
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Does exist

1035
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,200
not only in new york

1036
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,200
Also present at the School of Tropical Medicine in London

1037
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,200
Also present at the affiliated hospital of the School of Tropical Diseases of the University of Hamburg

1038
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,600
So it not only has to mention a new discipline

1039
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,600
it will have a new research facility

1040
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,200
Then it is worth saying a little bit here, that is,

1041
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,200
Du Congmin wants to set up a Chinese medicine hospital

1042
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,200
Research on Experimental Therapeutics of Chinese Medicine

1043
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,400
Actually very close to the same time

1044
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,600
In the period of the Republic of China, the goals that doctors of traditional Chinese medicine strived for

1045
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,400
Because at that time people criticized you and said

1046
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,400
The theory of Chinese medicine is unscientific, etc.

1047
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,400
They all already find it difficult to argue

1048
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,800
so they feel like

1049
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,600
I'll go first and I don't want to have so many scientific and philosophical debates with you.

1050
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,400
Let's first prove clinically that we are curative

1051
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,000
So they emphasize that the theory of Chinese medicine may not be scientific

1052
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,400
But the treatment is really effective

1053
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,200
so as to continuously strive for the establishment of

1054
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,400
Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital

1055
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,400
In fact, the Legislative Yuan has passed

1056
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,600
But later because of the relationship between the Sino-Japanese War

1057
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,800
there is no way to create

1058
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,160
But this is indeed the traditional Chinese medicine doctor in the period of the Republic of China

1059
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,960
There are also Chinese physicians in Japan who are simultaneously promoting the direction

1060
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,200
I hope to build a hospital

1061
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,840
So now I'm at the last entry in the multiple histories

1062
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,760
On the Research Method of "Tao Xing Adversity"

1063
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,600
Du Congming not only wants to introduce a new discipline

1064
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,400
Establishment of new research institutes

1065
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,280
And in terms of research methods and procedures

1066
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,720
He's also going to come up with something different

1067
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,840
He said that there are two methods for the research of Chinese medicine

1068
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,080
A first analysis of chemical active ingredients in the laboratory

1069
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,200
Use the method of experimental pharmacology to find out its function and use it in clinic

1070
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,680
He said another way

1071
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,120
We use prescriptions for sick people to drink

1072
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,040
Observing the clinical effect first

1073
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,600
Then moved to the research laboratory to investigate the active ingredients and their pharmacology

1074
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,600
a good way

1075
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,640
Then what he said sounds simple

1076
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,800
Just to mention two methods

1077
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,720
But if we put this back into the context of the Republic of China

1078
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,320
is a highly debated

1079
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,320
A debate on research design that also slams

1080
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,880
Someone even invented a term called

1081
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,880
12345 and 54321

1082
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,080
how to say

1083
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,400
is what they think

1084
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,560
Standard research procedure is

1085
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,520
you first need to know

1086
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,320
what are you researching

1087
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,920
So you have to extract the active ingredients first

1088
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,800
right

1089
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,920
So at that time

1090
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,800
National government started

1091
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,120
When deciding to conduct research on traditional Chinese medicine

1092
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,560
The first is the establishment of the Chinese Medicine Research Office

1093
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,720
Put it in the Chemistry Department of the Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine

1094
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,280
So a lot of research has focused on this step

1095
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,680
in chemical analysis

1096
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,520
Many times the composition cannot be found

1097
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,520
or found the components

1098
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,040
No legendary medicinal effect

1099
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,400
So I've been stuck on the first level

1100
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,360
So at that time

1101
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,920
As far as many TCM practitioners and those who support them say

1102
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,320
why don't we come

1103
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,200
Do clinical research first

1104
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,840
try it on a human

1105
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,960
but at the time

1106
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,560
highly controversial

1107
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,680
At the time, this was criticized as violating medical ethics.

1108
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,680
Just take some medicines that you don't even know the effects and toxicity of the medicines

1109
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,520
use it on people

1110
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,040
Even those who criticize Chinese medicine will quote Su Shi

1111
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,480
What Su Dongpo said

1112
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,160
Su Dongpo said to study books, waste paper, study medicine and waste people

1113
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,000
That is to say, if you want to learn calligraphy, you will need to use a lot of declarations

1114
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,440
What about you who studied medicine?

1115
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,000
Because you don't know how poisonous it is

1116
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,280
You must have ruined a lot of people

1117
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,000
It even means that the name must be the one that kills the most

1118
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,160
we don't know

1119
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,680
So this approach will be very criticized

1120
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,760
and it's not an accepted practice

1121
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,680
So what Du Congming just said

1122
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,280
The way he said it very plainly

1123
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,840
In fact, in this context

1124
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,760
is a highly controversial method

1125
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,280
Moreover, Du Congming not only pointed out that this method

1126
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,400
He even specifically pointed out which drugs he felt were the most worthy of research.

1127
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,680
he just said

1128
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,520
For so far, there is no way to extract the active ingredients chemically

1129
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,920
But Du Cong has clinically

1130
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Drugs that treat real diseases

1131
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
For example Bupleurum and Changshan for treating sadism

1132
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
be the first to conduct more sophisticated experimental therapeutic studies on them

1133
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Make sure the experiment works before going to the lab

1134
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Perform precision chemistry and biology experiments in reverse

1135
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
this is a very important question

1136
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
So it's not only talking about

1137
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
It is such a research method that was criticized at the time

1138
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And maybe you will find it surprising that

1139
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Of the only two examples it cites

1140
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
one of the long mountains

1141
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
After 20 years it has been proven that there is

1142
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It does work

1143
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
then this is

1144
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
was in the 1940s

1145
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
by Chen Guofu who has no medical background at all

1146
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
You may have heard of him

1147
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Chen Lifu

1148
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
We are in almost every TCM

1149
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Chen Lifu's calligraphy will be seen in the clinics of Chinese medicine practitioners

1150
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Since the period of the Republic of China

1151
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
has always been a supporter of Chinese medicine

1152
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
But has always been considered a cultural conservative

1153
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
support based on ideology

1154
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
support

1155
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
But Chen Guofu did

1156
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,960
led to a scientific experiment in the 1940s

1157
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:09,080
And this experiment proves the effect of Changshan drug abuse

1158
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,760
So later this was published in the journal of Science

1159
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,040
At that time, Chang Shanâ€™s article was called

1160
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,320
Nagayama New Anti-Military Drug

1161
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,880
So it's been proven

1162
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,240
that result

1163
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,440
Du Congming cited this example in 1929 with only two examples

1164
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,040
but he's never been able to do it

1165
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:31,400
But it proved to be a real success in 1943

1166
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,280
and what is more important

1167
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,320
The results of this research by Gofu

1168
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,760
is a study that directly affected last year's Nobel Prize in Qing Hao v.

1169
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,160
wait until 1967

1170
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,600
As you all know the story we hear now is that

1171
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,760
The CCP used the Vietnam War for the needs of the war

1172
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,880
made a political decision

1173
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,000
Launch mission 523, right?

1174
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,640
Then began to contribute to the final picture and found Qinghao again

1175
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,760
can cause sadism

1176
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,080
And won the Nobel Prize in 2015

1177
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
This is the question we hear most about the history of science in China

1178
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
It's just that you only hear Chairman Mao's decision

1179
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
But in fact, if we go back and look at his historical materials at that time

1180
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
at the beginning of this decision

1181
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,000
The first one in the research on Chinese medicine is Changshan

1182
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
It is because we already know that Changshan is effective

1183
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
So there are two consequences

1184
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
The first is to say

1185
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
In the past, people once suspected that Chinese medicine did not abuse people and start addiction again

1186
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
How can you find a medicine that works, right?

1187
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Wang Jinwei said so

1188
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
He said that I never believe that Chinese medicine can cure infectious diseases

1189
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
But what?

1190
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
In Guofu's experience, we already know that there is indeed

1191
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Does that make you feel like saying

1192
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
probably there will be, right?

1193
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Since they have found an effective drug before

1194
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Then it's likely they've discovered other medicines

1195
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
So the initial research consisted of two parts

1196
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
One part is hoping to reduce the

1197
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
That is, serious side effects such as vomiting

1198
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
on the other hand

1199
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Later, if the side effects cannot be reduced, a new drug will be found

1200
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,800
Finally found this Qinghaosu

1201
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,400
So from this point of view

1202
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,360
One of the examples selected by Dolceville

1203
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,460
It's actually a valid example, right?

1204
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,900
Moreover, this example directly inspires

1205
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,760
The current one is to say

1206
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,100
The result of such a major scientific research

1207
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,300
While at the Tuyoyo Drasca Committee

1208
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,700
committee committee says

1209
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,060
This may be the past 50 years

1210
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:24,360
The development of the most important Syriputics

1211
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,160
he said maybe but

1212
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,260
as you can imagine

1213
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,260
this is a very

1214
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:28,960
This is a

1215
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,960
so this is a

1216
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,360
Just look at this situation

1217
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,320
What about this period of history?

1218
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,860
And what?

1219
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:44,760
And not only is Du Congming right

1220
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,020
That's right, the medicine

1221
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,520
And in fact Chen Guofu

1222
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,520
Only the process of finding this medicine

1223
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,960
It is very similar to what Du Congming said

1224
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,020
I wrote a long article on this

1225
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,020
It's almost a joke

1226
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,780
As far as Chen Guofu's original and most primitive way is to

1227
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
He took a visitor to his house

1228
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
He just feeds him

1229
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
That's the man who got sadism

1230
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
He was cured later, he was very happy

1231
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Then he was at the Central Political School in Chongqing

1232
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
It is the National Chengchi University in Taiwan today.

1233
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
He is still the provost

1234
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
He taught them the people in the discipline

1235
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
put them bdsm students

1236
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Take this medicine for them all

1237
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Then it turns out the saddle bugs in their middle school are really down

1238
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
He just set up a laboratory

1239
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
so it's really a

1240
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Experimental research on humans first

1241
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
and therefore later

1242
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Other guests criticize him when they come to see it

1243
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
That is to say, he is the life of Chaojian

1244
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
And what?

1245
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
That is, this is actually a medical waste

1246
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
So he was criticized a lot

1247
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
he can't refute

1248
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
He only said that others criticized me as 54321

1249
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I am the pervert

1250
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
he can't refute

1251
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
But not only

1252
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Chen Guofu's successful case

1253
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It is parallel to what Du Congming said

1254
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
there is one more important thing

1255
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Let me tell you about this process in detail

1256
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
that is

1257
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,560
The first step in 54321 is chemical analysis

1258
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,000
but many people will say

1259
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,960
To go further, you have to figure out first

1260
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,760
You should analyze which crude drug, right?

1261
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,440
So you're doing pharmacognosy research

1262
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,200
know what is this long mountain

1263
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,760
so in other words

1264
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,600
Not just 12345 should be 012345

1265
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,920
You first know what Changshan is

1266
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,280
to find the components

1267
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,080
for animal experiments

1268
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:22,960
But what?

1269
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,880
In Guofu's case?

1270
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,160
he didn't

1271
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,280
i just told you

1272
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,480
He went directly to the local

1273
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,720
From today's pharmacy to buy medicine

1274
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,080
Is it for the receptionist?

1275
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,200
Wait until it proves effective

1276
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,640
Re-establish a research laboratory

1277
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,480
Then find everyone to make herbal medicine

1278
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,160
Chemistry Clinical Aspects of Research

1279
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,640
Just wait until it's time to do research in reverse

1280
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,080
A surprising thing was found to be

1281
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,480
Suppose they start

1282
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,880
If you do pharmacognosy research first

1283
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,600
what's your first step

1284
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,600
That's what Du Congming said

1285
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,320
Because Japan has the greatest contribution

1286
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,000
We're looking at Japanese scientific literature research

1287
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,840
right

1288
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,680
that japan as early as

1289
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,960
Japan is already here

1290
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,400
In 1827, the plant of this long mountain was found

1291
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,400
The identity of the plant

1292
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,000
in 1827

1293
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
This youth achievement has been found

1294
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And since then, it has been followed and everyone believes

1295
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Most of the scientists in the Republic of China

1296
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
also follow this noun

1297
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
It is believed that the plants of Nagayama originated from this

1298
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,400
But because their research on Guofu this time is to do clinical work first.

1299
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,000
So they later found out that

1300
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
the long mountain that really works

1301
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Oh, that is to say, the Japanese have already found out about this research

1302
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
But said he couldn't cure sadism

1303
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
That's because Guofu's story was done clinically first.

1304
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Already know it works, right?

1305
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So later found out that

1306
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
It turns out that we are not using this medicine, not this plant

1307
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
It's another ancient mountain

1308
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
So from this point of view

1309
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
It's because you didn't use one two three four five

1310
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
So you know this knowledge is wrong

1311
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Do you understand what I mean?

1312
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
So it was very scientific from the beginning

1313
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
First come to the scientists and then check the

1314
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,500
latest scientific literature

1315
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,500
Otherwise, he couldn't find this long mountain

1316
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,000
Because this Changshan is mainly produced in Japan and South Korea

1317
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Otherwise, he really bought this Changshan

1318
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,500
Then use it to prove the conclusion of the Japanese

1319
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,500
There's just no cure for sadism

1320
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,500
But because he immediately went straight to the local pharmacy to buy

1321
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,000
pharmacy bought medicine

1322
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
So it can be seen from this

1323
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
The local pharmacy knows what works, right?

1324
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,500
And because he bought that medicine first

1325
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,000
Conversely know it works

1326
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I found it wasn't this plant

1327
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,500
So he came to the conclusion that

1328
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,000
The Japanese keep getting it wrong

1329
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
The Japanese say Hechangshan

1330
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
It is different from Changshan in China

1331
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
That's the history we just had

1332
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,500
Materia Medica Research in Japan

1333
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,000
It is because some plants do not grow in Japan

1334
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,500
He looks for alternative plants

1335
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,000
But I'm not going far now

1336
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,500
just say a little bit

1337
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,000
In this case

1338
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
This successful example is not only

1339
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
not one two three four five

1340
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,500
And we can conversely say

1341
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,500
It's because he's not one, two, three, four, five that he succeeds so quickly

1342
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,000
right

1343
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Otherwise, it would not be easy to succeed so quickly

1344
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
so this is

1345
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,560
Another interesting point in this case

1346
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,140
So the story is actually more like

1347
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:10,140
Clinical application comes to a historical process of pharmacognosy research

1348
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,740
ok so what?

1349
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:16,700
Du Congming said lightly

1350
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:17,860
this is also a good way

1351
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,260
But in the period of the Republic of China to adopt this idea

1352
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,300
Everyone is scolded to death

1353
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,860
can't defend myself

1354
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,700
Like this doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, he said

1355
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:29,540
Regardless of any drug, first determine its principle from science

1356
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,540
clinically validated

1357
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,380
The truth is very smooth, but it is difficult to fake it

1358
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:37,380
Know from clinical knowledge first, then go to principle from scientific verification

1359
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,700
Prepare for troubles

1360
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,100
That's a defense he barely makes

1361
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,500
But it's weak to say it, right?

1362
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,000
So you can see that

1363
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,240
The results are attached here

1364
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,740
in the plain looking lexeme

1365
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,800
He proposes a potentially highly controversial

1366
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,300
And it is not accepted by others

1367
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,300
He has

1368
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,700
He is in a research project

1369
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,100
To introduce a new discipline

1370
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:58,980
create a new institution

1371
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,040
make another

1372
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,200
a new research method

1373
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,000
There are just too many anomalies that challenge the original research paradigm

1374
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,500
It's no wonder that you will be criticized by others

1375
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,800
OK, so I'll put it in five veins now

1376
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,500
let's come back

1377
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,000
It turns out that I was talking about the mystery of Du Congming's research

1378
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,500
We can get an idea of â€‹â€‹what

1379
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:25,500
That's why he continued his life promoting unscientific

1380
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,500
What about research methods that are considered unscientific?

1381
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,000
From our point of view today

1382
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
It doesn't seem like he's promoting some unscientific research method

1383
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Instead, a research approach with multiple breakthroughs

1384
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
right

1385
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,500
That means his research was indeed influenced by Japan

1386
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,500
Inspired by Japanese Pharmacy

1387
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,500
but he introduced experimental therapeutics

1388
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:47,500
To break through the tradition of no therapeutic research in the Japanese Empire at that time

1389
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,500
And it also broke through in the West

1390
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,000
You have no tradition of using experimental therapeutics to study herbal medicine

1391
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,500
Both are breakthroughs

1392
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,000
Then you turned to the context of the Republic of China and spoke

1393
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
He is a tall man that is to say

1394
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,020
best scientific training but he chooses to do research like this

1395
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,600
Then he will introduce an East Asian

1396
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:09,520
Unheard of idea for a research hospital

1397
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,600
Then came a highly controversial one

1398
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,500
The Way of Doing the Right Way

1399
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:18,500
And this research method was later proven to be effective, right?

1400
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,620
So from this point of view, even if there is no why puzzle

1401
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:24,160
There is no way to untie it, I think at least everyone can

1402
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,660
One thing I feel is that he's definitely not an understatement when he mentions this whole project.

1403
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,080
or the traditional way

1404
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,920
but a very forward looking

1405
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,080
That is to say, a breakthrough idea

1406
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:39,520
I hope everyone can feel that this can be established

1407
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,720
That

1408
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,780
And I can't help but want to say one more thing

1409
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,280
maybe not directly related to puzzle solving

1410
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,280
That said, I think it's not only a pretty groundbreaking idea

1411
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,780
It's actually a very strategic and ambitious idea

1412
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,480
Because in many ways

1413
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,280
He was on the edge, right?

1414
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,900
In terms of modern medicine

1415
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,300
He didn't have experimental therapeutics in Imperial Japan

1416
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,800
compared to imperial japan

1417
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,500
Of course Taiwan is not a center of medicine

1418
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,800
Compared with traditional Chinese or traditional Chinese words

1419
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,100
Of course also the center

1420
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:12,000
We will take it for granted that it is right in China

1421
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,100
But he doesn't limit himself by fear of the edge

1422
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,900
Instead he combines all the edges together

1423
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,700
and became a very groundbreaking idea

1424
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:27,200
So after he combined these edge positions where they were originally located,

1425
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,100
He can use the rigorous training and qualifications of scientists rarely seen in the Republic of China

1426
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:35,100
is the qualification

1427
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:39,100
Experimental Therapeutics was developed even after the Japanese Empire was established in Taiwan

1428
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:44,000
Building and researching traditional medicine in East Asia that the Western world has not fully mastered

1429
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,400
So if this thing is really done for him

1430
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,800
He does have a unique trait, doesn't he?

1431
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,200
Hardly anyone is his main competitor

1432
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,000
I think it's a very ambitious

1433
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,200
And I am very active in the idea of â€‹â€‹combining my weaknesses into strengths

1434
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,000
at least to me

1435
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,240
It's very inspiring, so I want to share it with you.

1436
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,000
Well

1437
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,280
If we start from this point of view

1438
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,720
We can have a few further questions

1439
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,880
One is why Du Congming has the value of traditional medicine

1440
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,280
have such deep appreciation

1441
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,040
to conceive of such a groundbreaking research project

1442
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,520
Because everyone can feel it

1443
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,760
The reason why he wants to come up with so many breakthroughs

1444
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,840
There is a big reason

1445
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:28,120
He believes in the value of traditional medicine more than

1446
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,400
The value of our research with pharmaceutical methods

1447
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:31,080
right

1448
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,720
He understands that

1449
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,000
so what

1450
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,120
Because he believes that there is such a value that far exceeds the current realization

1451
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,600
He's the one who conceived of a breakthrough research project.

1452
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,840
Why does he have such deep appreciation

1453
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,480
that's actually a good question

1454
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,200
And this also involves the history of Chinese medicine in Taiwan

1455
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,920
But I can't tell you now

1456
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,680
back back give complete answer

1457
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,640
but i think it's an interesting question

1458
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,240
what about the second one

1459
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,360
Everyone like just now if it sounds like after

1460
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,040
should feel a little bit

1461
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,400
I think Du Congming now sounds

1462
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,300
Du Congming is a very normal scientist

1463
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,300
normal but ambitious scientist

1464
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,500
It's just a normal research project, right?

1465
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,900
Then where is my Du cleverness fascinated?

1466
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:18,400
If everyone now thinks that I seem to cancel Du Congming to be fascinated

1467
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,600
That is to say, our second question is to say

1468
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,100
Why such a breakthrough research project

1469
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:28,700
still persists as a conservative

1470
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,700
Conservative and reactionary approach

1471
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,300
Then I will now return to the main axis of our article

1472
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,000
This is largely the same as what we just said

1473
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,400
the Great Rupture of Modernity

1474
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,300
That's why the so-called Du is clever and fascinated

1475
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,500
In fact, it has nothing to do with Du Congming

1476
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,000
he is a normal scientist

1477
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,400
Just might suggest some more cutting edge

1478
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,600
more challenging

1479
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,400
existing scientific research methods

1480
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,400
So let's put it

1481
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,200
If we think he's a fan

1482
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,800
words that can't even be played

1483
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,800
just reflects people's static view of science

1484
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,200
especially regarding modern science and traditional medicine as two opposing

1485
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,160
holistic view of science

1486
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,360
This is the atmosphere of the whole era

1487
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,440
even to some extent today

1488
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,520
are still the atmosphere of our time

1489
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:16,200
If I am wrong, please correct me, Vice President Liu.

1490
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,240
I heard

1491
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,880
I remember that academicians of Academia Sinica discussed it ten years ago

1492
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:25,400
Should Chinese medicine or Chinese medicine be an elective course in medical school?

1493
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,040
It seems that the academicians object

1494
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,080
Said that because the Taiwanese are superstitious enough

1495
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,320
If the Academia Sinica takes the lead in incorporating this course into the teaching materials of the medical school

1496
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,280
Taiwanese will become more superstitious

1497
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,920
It's a sign that a problem is still alive

1498
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,600
right

1499
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:45,280
That is to say, if today we cannot clearly distinguish

1500
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,720
What is science, what is not science, what is tradition, what is modern

1501
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,080
if you don't know

1502
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:56,440
Then everything has to be examined and debated one by one.

1503
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,280
This political Du Congyuan first said what he didn't want to do

1504
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,400
It's something the Fusni man said he wouldn't do.

1505
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,600
He said it was very clear, right?

1506
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,200
So from this point of view

1507
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,600
Our Great Rupture in Modernity

1508
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,800
If it can be established

1509
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,800
must be very clear

1510
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,200
Who is scientific progress and who is conservative and reactionary

1511
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,000
right

1512
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,200
that way you can make a lot of decisions without doubt

1513
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,200
don't say anything, you start to feel like saying

1514
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,800
This matter is not good for our situation in Taiwan.

1515
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,600
different from anywhere in the world

1516
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,400
then everything needs to be discussed

1517
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:33,000
So under this big break in modernity?

1518
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,200
It's hard for you to tolerate thoughts like Du Congming's

1519
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,600
in his thoughts

1520
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,400
He is not only a representative of modernity

1521
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,500
and he feels

1522
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:44,800
The value that exists in the tradition is worth learning

1523
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,300
far beyond what we understand today

1524
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,100
so that we are worth developing

1525
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,300
Some newer research methods

1526
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,500
Even challenge the existing research methods

1527
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,400
to realize these values

1528
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,700
That's exactly what it means

1529
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,900
in those days or today

1530
01:03:58,900 --> 01:03:59,900
Many times we are not able to

1531
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,300
accepted things

1532
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:02,500
That

1533
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,500
It is precisely because of the fact that Du Congming was included in the modernity discourse

1534
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,500
And one of the poles of our common sense

1535
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,400
Therefore, Du Congming's research on Chinese Yi medicine

1536
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,600
had to become a

1537
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:15,000
The mystery of unknown language

1538
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,100
So I don't know if people will think that it means

1539
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,000
We heard on the one hand that he had three studies

1540
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,400
But now if you go to see

1541
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,700
There are so many books about Du Congming

1542
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,700
Almost none of us have heard of the research on Chinese Yi medicine

1543
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:25,200
right

1544
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,800
Even if everyone mentions

1545
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,300
It's a bit embarrassing

1546
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,600
And then and historically he has never been able to

1547
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:31,800
put it into practice

1548
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,600
So from this point of view

1549
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,400
This is such a very creative project

1550
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,700
It became impossible to realize back then

1551
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,900
And this year we have no way to incorporate the easy

1552
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,300
He made a Taiwan medical modernity

1553
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:46,700
or the image of the representative of scientific modernity

1554
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,200
Putting it into this story seems to create a

1555
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,400
figuratively

1556
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,500
Maybe some people will think it's a stain

1557
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,500
That is to say, because of this, it becomes impossible for us to see this

1558
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,000
see him like this

1559
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Well, now I'm at the end of my speech.

1560
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I just started talking to you about a big issue that concerns me, right?

1561
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
That is to say, how has Chinese medicine developed within half a century

1562
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
From 1925 to 1997

1563
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,000
From the deadly enemy of modernity to the most concrete symbol and tool of Chinese exploration and modernity

1564
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Then the example I gave you today is not an example in the context of China

1565
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
But an example of a parallel correlation

1566
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And then I by this case

1567
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
That said, let's say this is my main title

1568
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
If we try to put the story of Du Congming into this historical transformation

1569
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
what would we think

1570
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I think everyone would sometimes think about why this transformation happened.

1571
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
The easiest thing to think of is how many

1572
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
One is that China is very backward anyway, right?

1573
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
So there has been no progress

1574
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Even the original research results of the academic circles would think that

1575
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
used by Mao Zedong

1576
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,600
to claim a new China with a very different science

1577
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,260
So support TCM for political reasons

1578
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,520
This is for academia

1579
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,760
before i wrote my book

1580
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,600
This is the most popular saying

1581
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,760
That is to say, to explain this process of historical transformation in this way

1582
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,040
But if we now

1583
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,080
Putting this historical course in the words of a smart story

1584
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,640
we added a lot

1585
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:24,520
such a parallel story

1586
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,320
we added a lot

1587
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,240
In such traditional thinking

1588
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,680
elements that cannot be seen

1589
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,000
For example, the Japanese medicinal tradition

1590
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:34,920
right

1591
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,000
that is

1592
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,360
The process of historical transformation

1593
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:40,200
It is related to the scientific development of Japan

1594
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,640
This is not a story that happened entirely in China

1595
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,920
and in fact in my book

1596
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,240
There are also references to more Japanese influences

1597
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,880
For example, in the late Qing Dynasty

1598
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,360
After all, it was already very bad.

1599
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,800
Later, it was because Japan still kept the truth

1600
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:56,560
That's why the reformers of Chinese medicine in the Republic of China said

1601
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:00,320
We should pull the truth back to the core of Chinese medicine

1602
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
become one of his four main axes

1603
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
That's why it's 1971

1604
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
That is to say, Restin went to China to discover the real situation

1605
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
So there are scientific implications in this story

1606
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Also has Japanese influence

1607
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Second Experimental Therapeutics

1608
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
this story is not a

1609
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
It is a historical process with many new scientific developments

1610
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
So people who try to support Chinese medicine

1611
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Not all conservative and reactionary people

1612
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Instead, many of them want to bring in the latest

1613
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Introduce and seriously attempt to introduce the latest scientific developments

1614
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Come into this history and give him evidence

1615
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
The third is that they don't even just import

1616
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
even in their environment

1617
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Attempt to create a unique local research method

1618
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Of course, this will meet with great resistance.

1619
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Just like Du Congming's "Tao Xing Reverse Casting"

1620
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
What about the fourth?

1621
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
That is to say, the person concerned does have a value for traditional medical treatment.

1622
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
is a very deep understanding

1623
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Moreover, Du Congming mentioned Changshan

1624
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
this specific drug

1625
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
What everyone wants to see is actually really surprising, right?

1626
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
He only lifted two pills and he lifted one

1627
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Drugs that were later proven to be effective

1628
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And this Changshan, although in Du Congming's story

1629
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
He has been unable to bring this research to fruition

1630
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Only one ideal is missing

1631
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
And not only there is no way to realize it, but only an ideal

1632
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
and in our history

1633
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
We hardly even know about it

1634
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
But he's in another vein

1635
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
parallel unrelated

1636
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Chen Guofu has not read Du Congming's article

1637
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
as far as i know no

1638
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
But after 1945, he had contacted Du Congming

1639
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
But the development of Changshan is independent of Du Congming

1640
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
this suggested

1641
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
It has been proven that it can indeed treat malaria

1642
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
and even contributed to a

1643
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
major breakthrough in medicine

1644
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Qinghaosu

1645
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
so i now

1646
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
last say

1647
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I can't give you a story about this

1648
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
complete conclusion

1649
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
But if you take this story

1650
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
put it in

1651
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,740
We feel this transformation process

1652
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:05,380
Shouldn't just be entirely traditional

1653
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,540
right

1654
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:10,540
It is not because Chinese medicine has always maintained a traditional situation

1655
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,040
And after this transformation

1656
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:15,340
On the contrary, he follows the trend of the modern system

1657
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:18,340
There is a lot of interaction

1658
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:19,540
And what?

1659
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,900
But what about this history?

1660
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,800
also full of creativity

1661
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,140
There are many people who think

1662
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:30,880
They know the value of traditional medicine

1663
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,140
come up with creative ways

1664
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:34,580
hope to confirm

1665
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:36,140
In his example there is no way to achieve

1666
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:37,880
But here it is implemented

1667
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:38,680
Du Congming

1668
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,840
And it's important to

1669
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,540
such historical cases

1670
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:43,580
most of our time

1671
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:44,740
When we think about this history

1672
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,880
almost completely invisible

1673
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,840
without entering our consciousness

1674
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:51,540
So the last thing I want to tell you is

1675
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:52,880
The development of this history

1676
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:53,980
maybe more than we thought

1677
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:55,280
a lot more interesting

1678
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,380
And it is worth our deep thinking

1679
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:59,720
that ends my report

1680
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:00,720
thank you all

1681
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Thank you very much Dr. Lei for a very wonderful presentation

1682
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
shall we be more open

1683
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Is there anything I want to ask Dr. Lei?

1684
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Or some comments are welcome

1685
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Hello, teacher

1686
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
When I was in 2006

1687
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Graduated from National Taiwan University School of Medicine

1688
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
for new drug development

1689
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
So about what you said ten years ago

1690
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Academician of Central Plains

1691
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Then they opposed Chinese medicine research

1692
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I remember this incident very clearly

1693
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Because in fact, even National Taiwan University Hospital

1694
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
They probably lasted until 100 years

1695
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
In the 100th year of the Republic of China

1696
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Only then did they really feel that doing Chinese medicine research

1697
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
is valuable

1698
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Before that in National Taiwan University Hospital

1699
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
You said you want to do Chinese medicine

1700
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
people will think

1701
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,120
think you are weird

1702
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,120
right

1703
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,120
so this thing is true

1704
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,120
And about the perverse

1705
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:09,460
It is Mr. Du Congming's perverse research method

1706
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:11,620
So I knew it when I was in the National Taiwan University Hospital

1707
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:13,460
And then when I started doing medicine

1708
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:16,420
At that time, Omics in the world was physical science

1709
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,620
Right technology started to develop

1710
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:22,120
Then don't say that you will be criticized at that time

1711
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,620
When we were making medicine

1712
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:26,420
what we are happy about is

1713
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,420
In the bamboo, you can buy the general clothes

1714
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:29,920
Zhipuyi is theoretically a kind of

1715
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,040
what do you put in

1716
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,040
Then all his ingredients will be beaten out of the one

1717
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,040
We are very happy to ask the senior

1718
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:39,040
Hey, senior, why does the teacher only look at one component at a time?

1719
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,040
why didn't he say

1720
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:43,540
Pull out everything in the tape sample you analyzed

1721
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:45,540
Why would you take that Profi

1722
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:46,540
just as long as it's not this

1723
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:48,540
Delete all the medicines we want to see

1724
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:51,040
But there might be something else very important in him

1725
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,040
For example, it doesn't matter if he wears something

1726
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,540
Then I was scolded by the senior

1727
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:58,040
He said don't ask strange questions

1728
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,160
You get punched every time you ask weird questions

1729
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
So I used to be scolded by the teacher

1730
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
And then later when I left the State Department

1731
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Then when I went to the hospital to do clinical work

1732
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I found out that it's not just the teacher who scolds you

1733
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
The teacher is more kind

1734
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
you are IRB

1735
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
When the human experimentation committee held the cannon accountable

1736
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
that's the scariest thing

1737
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
but i think in fact

1738
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
we should be able to say

1739
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
The teachers of the Human Clinical Trials Committee

1740
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
he doesn't seem to understand

1741
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Is it the value of this matter?

1742
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
So what you said, teacher

1743
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
In fact, until now

1744
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I think he is still in Taiwan

1745
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
keeps happening

1746
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
yes then that about

1747
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
that traditional medicine

1748
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Why is he fighting for this technology

1749
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
i remember i was in 2011

1750
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
When studying Chinese medicine at Yangming University

1751
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
At that time, I was also very happy to learn to fight for

1752
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
But everyone says I don't have wisdom roots

1753
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Because it is not only people who can fight

1754
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
you may find it difficult for you to study

1755
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
you may find it difficult for you to study

1756
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
But not only people can fight

1757
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
You can fight for the teacher

1758
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
But then this problem will come

1759
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
you're going to poke a mouse

1760
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
how do you know

1761
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
What position did you poke at?

1762
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
We poke down every time

1763
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
See when the muscles shake

1764
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
we just want that right

1765
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
But you can't poke someone like this

1766
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
right

1767
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
So at that time there was a senior doctor of traditional Chinese medicine

1768
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
just teach me how to feel the pulse

1769
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
they will say why

1770
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I can't tell the difference

1771
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Pregnant women's pulse will be slippery

1772
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
But I'm going to take the boy's pulse

1773
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Then

1774
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Then there was one time in that

1775
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
The Department of Health has organized the Chinese Medicine Research Conference

1776
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I was

1777
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I talked about this with teachers from other countries

1778
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I say it's very disturbing

1779
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I am really good at saving the world

1780
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
And foreign scholars like it very much

1781
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
But is there any way

1782
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Do quantitative methods to help everyone

1783
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Interpretation

1784
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Then until about 2014

1785
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
American MIT

1786
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
They are really scholars

1787
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
They published a study called

1788
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
action

1789
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
microscope

1790
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
is that it can be more than just

1791
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,500
the lips

1792
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,000
or

1793
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,500
pulse

1794
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,000
it can help you zoom in

1795
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,500
So you can clearly judge

1796
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,500
is this a patient

1797
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,000
is it healthy or sick

1798
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
or it lips what it's talking about

1799
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,500
Yes, and with this technology

1800
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,000
then actually

1801
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,500
You can actually apply it to

1802
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,000
The pulse condition of traditional Chinese medicine is interpreted

1803
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,500
Right and so this is Chinese medicine

1804
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,500
Why is it now the subject of Zhengjiu technology?

1805
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,500
It is now de facto important in East Asia

1806
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,500
a door

1807
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,500
precious

1808
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,500
The reason people will call it a real treasure

1809
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,500
And it's actually recognized by the United Nations

1810
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:37,500
yes then so honestly

1811
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,500
thank you very much for your speech today

1812
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,500
thank you for this

1813
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,500
Thank you very much for your points

1814
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,500
sorry

1815
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,500
that thank you so much for sharing

1816
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,500
that is me

1817
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,500
Your sharing is actually

1818
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,500
in my feeling

1819
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,500
A very important part is to say

1820
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,000
What Du Congming said at the time

1821
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
from a certain point of view

1822
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
On the one hand, we can say that it actually has a vision

1823
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
And conveniently, it can be said that this is still there today.

1824
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,740
In justice, right?

1825
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:05,140
Now I kind of want to borrow

1826
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:07,780
Do a self-reflection on what you just said

1827
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:10,240
That is to say, in fact, this is what we study

1828
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:13,440
History of Modern Traditional Medicine

1829
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,180
a very special point

1830
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,680
It's just that what we study is completely non-committal.

1831
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,580
As of today, there is no general conclusion

1832
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:21,020
contemporary relevance

1833
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,260
Both sides are still in a high degree of justice

1834
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,860
such a situation

1835
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:27,360
just say what i mean

1836
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:28,600
like the one just now

1837
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,700
Vice President Liu introduced

1838
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:32,800
I'm in a department of history of science

1839
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,240
get a doctorate

1840
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,940
Then most of our friends have studied

1841
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:38,440
That is to say, whether it is the history of physics or the history of biology

1842
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,080
when historians began to study the meaning of coming

1843
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,640
That is to say, things have been concluded

1844
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,180
truth we already know

1845
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,820
That's called Ke Shuli

1846
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:48,080
So what historians do is start with

1847
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,960
we already know what the conclusion is

1848
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:53,020
At least write back the angle of who won

1849
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:54,820
But only today I do this research

1850
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:56,320
From a certain point of view until today

1851
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,360
There is also a tall one

1852
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,360
means uncertainty and truth

1853
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,300
So I think on the one hand you feel

1854
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,860
maybe a little resonant and inspiring

1855
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,140
But on the other hand we can also say

1856
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:07,680
the truth of this matter

1857
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,980
we don't quite know yet

1858
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,520
and even i kinda want to

1859
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,800
come further

1860
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,840
say play the bad guy

1861
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,140
to say one thing

1862
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:17,660
Actually from

1863
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,460
Du Conghui

1864
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:22,020
Who he doesn't accept when he mentions these studies

1865
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:23,800
Locke

1866
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,840
exist

1867
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,360
Some of the Union Hospital

1868
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:27,400
medical scientist

1869
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,440
They think it's easy to understand

1870
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:30,980
because he felt

1871
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:32,840
You don't have any yin and yang elements

1872
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,820
We also have 400 million say

1873
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:36,600
We also have very long science

1874
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,920
We also have a lot of medicines that people say are useful

1875
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,200
But since the end of the 19th century

1876
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,120
We did a large clinical study results

1877
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,000
proven medicine

1878
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,800
Most of them are useless

1879
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,820
that is

1880
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:48,120
The American Medical Association was founded

1881
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,680
A great feature is to say

1882
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,720
It turned out that the previous medical period was useless

1883
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:52,740
So according to what I just said

1884
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:54,540
It is easy for them to regard Chinese medicine as

1885
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:57,340
Same thing as their old medical

1886
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:58,880
So they also feel

1887
01:16:58,880 --> 01:16:59,980
we just did

1888
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,560
After such a glorious revolution in medicine

1889
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,360
Then know what medicine is useful

1890
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:07,680
Then why should I waste my time on your side

1891
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,220
So what I mean is kind of saying

1892
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:11,520
I want to echo your argument

1893
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,820
is that this does have a high correlation

1894
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:16,140
But on the contrary, it also highlights that

1895
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:18,560
As far as Du Congming is concerned, he wants to propose such an idea

1896
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,980
even put into practice

1897
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:22,020
it was difficult

1898
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:22,780
so

1899
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:24,840
If you feel wronged sometimes, you should

1900
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,120
Think Du Congming should

1901
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:29,960
He even became the dean of National Taiwan University Hospital and couldn't give classes later

1902
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,020
I think all of us should be able to bear our grievances.

1903
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,860
That is to say, I kind of want to borrow this

1904
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,380
to say is to say

1905
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:39,680
In fact, one of the problems highlighted

1906
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,460
that is

1907
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:46,080
a condition in progress

1908
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,640
yes

1909
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,700
Thank you Mr. Lei for your speech

1910
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,240
Today's class is a little bit

1911
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,540
Make up for the previous time in medical school

1912
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:57,100
did not read part of the history of medicine

1913
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,860
When it comes to Chinese medicine and Western medicine, I want to learn

1914
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,400
The first lesson we have to learn is that to bet is to bet

1915
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:08,000
It kind of echoes your saying that Su Dongpo is a medical student.

1916
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,840
So be careful when using drugs

1917
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:14,840
In the research of Chinese and Western medicine, if we put the so-called positive attitude into research

1918
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:20,240
Perhaps in the part of western medicine, it emphasizes on getting rid of the bad effects first.

1919
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:21,840
Don't treat people as experiments

1920
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,880
But Chinese medicine is a kind of comparative experiment

1921
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,480
It's empirical science, it's been used for thousands of years and it really works

1922
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,480
For example, this three-legged branch

1923
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,480
Like acupuncture and moxibustion in terms of anesthesia and pain relief

1924
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,480
it has indeed been demonstrated

1925
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:40,480
After the demonstration, the problem is that it will be a little controversial to study it with Western methods

1926
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:44,480
The biggest controversy is that it comes from the placebo effect

1927
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:49,480
In fact, many medicines do not necessarily have to be effective, but they are effective when we see a doctor.

1928
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:53,480
Seeing a doctor is effective, so how to get rid of the placebo effect?

1929
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:57,480
In Western medicine, it is relatively clear that it proposes the Shuangman experiment

1930
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,480
Just like a doctor and a patient

1931
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,800
The patient doesn't know what the drug is

1932
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,840
Then when comparing the two

1933
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:04,960
Then prove it

1934
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,400
It's true that this drug is more effective than a placebo

1935
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,760
that's called effective

1936
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,000
But what is really effective in medicine

1937
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,200
In fact, placebos are also effective

1938
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,000
So from a medical point of view

1939
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,880
You can also skip to see

1940
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:17,680
Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine

1941
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,280
Whether it's a black cat or a white cat

1942
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,080
It's a good cat to be able to catch him

1943
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,000
sick

1944
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,200
Why is the placebo effect not considered effective?

1945
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,400
This is what we do in medical school

1946
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,680
I often discuss whether I sold some medicine

1947
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:30,880
including food

1948
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,520
If the consumer finds it effective

1949
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,320
why don't you sell him

1950
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,280
Selling the placebo effect is also a good effect

1951
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:41,080
So from a valid point of view

1952
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,880
That's what you said just now

1953
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,400
When viewed from another point of view

1954
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:46,480
he will show up and say

1955
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,480
Nothing wrong with looking clinically effective

1956
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,200
But after proof

1957
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,680
Maybe he's the same as the placebo

1958
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,920
That's also in medicine

1959
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,080
Actually the subtle part

1960
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,080
so this controversy

1961
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,080
I don't think it's easy

1962
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,300
When we want to use the words of traditional Chinese medicine

1963
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,000
I'm talking about Sashi

1964
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,800
He mixes a lot of medicine

1965
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,000
So take out its components

1966
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,200
In fact, as my partner just said,

1967
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,400
In fact, there are some other metabolites

1968
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,700
Might work

1969
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:18,000
But you only analyze the same time every time

1970
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
It doesn't actually prove that

1971
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
His effect comes from this ingredient

1972
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Ephedrine is a special case

1973
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,800
happens to have one main ingredient

1974
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,500
Then find its components from traditional medicine

1975
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,500
This case is very rare

1976
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:34,500
Because the entire treatment process of traditional Chinese medicine

1977
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,500
it's not that simple

1978
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,500
That's what I think our show today

1979
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,500
That is to say, in this topic

1980
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:45,500
I really admire Dr. Du Congwen

1981
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:46,500
he was at that time

1982
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,500
just what you said

1983
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:49,500
he's on the edge

1984
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:50,500
then go find one

1985
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,500
Quite able to become a main axis of the protagonist

1986
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:56,500
It's an interesting piece of history from this point of view.

1987
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,500
Thanks

1988
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,500
Thanks

1989
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,160
Thank you, Dr. Lei, for your wonderful speech today.

1990
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:06,960
That's why I'm very interested in Dr. Du Congming's retrograde spellcasting

1991
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:11,320
Because I think his is similar to our current transfer medicine to a certain extent

1992
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:15,080
Because transfer medicine is to combine basic and clinical research

1993
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,360
Of course, you can also start from the basics.

1994
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,160
Then find it effective and then apply it to animals

1995
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,960
and then apply it to humans

1996
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,040
But we sometimes issue some phenomena clinically

1997
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:26,960
Then go back and talk about designing some experiments

1998
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:31,080
Let's see what the underlying mechanism is

1999
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:35,280
Then you say that the matter of using people as experiments is not necessarily not on the CE level.

2000
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,040
Like we sometimes use some off label use

2001
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,680
That is to say, if A is effective for disease A at the beginning

2002
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:42,440
But we may accidentally find that it is also effective in B disease

2003
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:45,480
Then go back and see what the mechanism is.

2004
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:49,360
So this is not necessarily an experiment with humans.

2005
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,600
yes so i think this

2006
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,520
In fact, I feel like what the gentleman said just now is to say

2007
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:57,120
In fact, there may be many effective ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine.

2008
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,120
It's just that we haven't used some so-called

2009
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,680
It's just a scientific method recognized by the West to formalize

2010
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:05,600
Thanks

2011
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,240
I will respond first

2012
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:10,440
The gentleman you just mentioned means that

2013
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,600
poison problem

2014
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,320
In fact, what Mantre said is that

2015
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:15,480
Changshan is poison

2016
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:17,640
just say yes now

2017
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,320
And it is a poison in the compendium of this article

2018
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,320
also poisonous

2019
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,640
So actually from this point of view

2020
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:23,920
there is a part that says

2021
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,640
accumulated knowledge

2022
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,760
Some knowledge about toxicity

2023
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,000
And later, like the one I just used by Chen Guofu

2024
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,160
When he used it, he used to call it Jiemao Pill

2025
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,120
He knows not to use it on pregnant women

2026
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,560
And this means that

2027
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,120
Don't use it casually on others

2028
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,440
Because I know it's poisonous

2029
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:40,800
You have to wait until someone's sadism is cured

2030
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,760
It's happened to a certain extent

2031
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,360
In other words, you're more certain of his sadism.

2032
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,680
But in fact he was

2033
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,960
The way to cure the doctor will not be to torture the worm, right?

2034
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,640
at least when you're sure

2035
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,560
You are only halfway to cure this disease

2036
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:52,680
in fact they

2037
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,960
What I mean by this is that

2038
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:55,280
you are right

2039
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,240
on the one hand that is

2040
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,000
this is an important concern

2041
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,080
But in fact, they have accumulated some

2042
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,400
relevant knowledge

2043
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,560
On the other hand, it is also the other way around.

2044
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,360
directly like fruit skin

2045
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,320
when serving to others

2046
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,360
It's actually a bit dangerous.

2047
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,400
In addition to what you just said

2048
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,440
Possible effect

2049
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,400
This is indeed a question that many people will ask

2050
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,440
But this kind of echoes

2051
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:16,640
the one in front

2052
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:19,640
That lady, what you just said is that

2053
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,920
as far as i know

2054
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,640
That truth can indeed be applied to animals

2055
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:24,600
That is to say, it is already effective

2056
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,680
not employing

2057
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,080
not use human blood

2058
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,520
So this is actually a

2059
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:29,520
just to say

2060
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,000
At least in animals

2061
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,640
This must not be a possible effect

2062
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:36,000
It must be working for some other reason

2063
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,240
then

2064
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,200
The last thing you said was that

2065
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,240
Actually Possible effect

2066
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,760
also a good thing

2067
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,560
why would

2068
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,640
It means you do the two-chamber experiment

2069
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:48,560
Just take it as if to exclude it from your evaluation

2070
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,080
You just said this

2071
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,200
Actually this

2072
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,280
i know a case

2073
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,200
that's because

2074
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,560
That is to say, at Harvard University

2075
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,720
Their Otentative Medicine Office

2076
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:57,960
there is a researcher

2077
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,040
he is doing this research

2078
01:23:59,040 --> 01:23:59,760
that is

2079
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Is it possible to think through this research

2080
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,400
How to strengthen placible effect

2081
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,400
That said, don't think of it as just

2082
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,400
row measure out such a thing

2083
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,200
Then this is a bit close to Du Congming's idea

2084
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,700
It means we find something of value

2085
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,900
to design new research methods

2086
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:20,000
Then try to understand its possible function

2087
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,500
probably this is the case

2088
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:24,300
Thank you for the situation you just said

2089
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,000
I might have to ask you

2090
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,500
I have heard it many times

2091
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,500
but i don't know very well

2092
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,000
The details of that translation medicine

2093
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,500
so i'll ask you again

2094
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,500
Thanks

2095
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:41,500
I am after chemistry

2096
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,500
I have always been interested in Chinese medicine

2097
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,000
but never had a chance to do it

2098
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,500
I thought about doing some research to help

2099
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,000
Then I switched to immunity

2100
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,500
Finally I learned fine medicine

2101
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,500
so in fact i am

2102
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,500
The main character is you so I don't want to talk about myself

2103
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,500
No, then just a dermatologist

2104
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:00,500
That is also to continue to have an extreme interest in Chinese medicine

2105
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
but never had a chance to do

2106
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
One after another, the views on Chinese and English are not the same

2107
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Then the research is not the same

2108
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
So I'm thinking I've gained a lot today

2109
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
i was thinking

2110
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
in fact you may have said

2111
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
this mystery this is

2112
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I'm talking about whether he was at that time

2113
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Because he wrote the 60,000

2114
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
very amazing

2115
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
he wrote sixty thousand

2116
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
but he skimmed the words of the book

2117
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Probably not necessarily 100 times, 100 times

2118
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
he may have this amazing ability

2119
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
able to see

2120
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Then he read the history of the nations

2121
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
so he saw some evidence base

2122
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
There was no Clean your trial

2123
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
But finally I keep feeling

2124
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
There is no evidence base

2125
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
not gone

2126
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
it works

2127
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
did not do trial

2128
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
But looking at the words of thousands of years

2129
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Grandfather began to say

2130
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
In the end, in fact, there can be evidence

2131
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Are you looking at history?

2132
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Articles written by Congming

2133
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
It can be seen that he saw some often an example

2134
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Maybe there are other examples

2135
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
So of course he speaks in English

2136
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
intrigue

2137
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
He thinks it works

2138
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
so he saw this

2139
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
so he saw some evidence

2140
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Then he said he was going to push

2141
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
And said he believes that all Chinese medicines are effective

2142
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
but it will work

2143
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
So if you look at those with more evidence

2144
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
for research

2145
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
It should work like this

2146
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
this is

2147
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
eight door farmer

2148
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
so i thought this i wanted to find out

2149
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Is there such a possibility in history?

2150
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
maybe what you just said

2151
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
i just didn't hear fully

2152
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
The second is the fact that traditional Chinese medicine needs to last until the end

2153
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
in fact it should be

2154
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
If it is a chemical drug

2155
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
It is what we made and traditional Chinese medicine

2156
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
It is the identity in Chinese medicine

2157
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
all chemicals

2158
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
chemicals are the same thing

2159
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
It's not like something made in a lab

2160
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
is a chemical

2161
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
inside the plant

2162
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
So it's another

2163
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
are likely to be the same

2164
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
in fact it is

2165
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Like for example Tuxol these all become

2166
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Later, some medicines from western medicine practitioners

2167
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
So in fact it should be the same

2168
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
The second is

2169
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,160
Now I feel more and more

2170
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,680
suck a lot

2171
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,320
Just relying on one medicine may not be enough

2172
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,880
so it is always needed

2173
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:10,320
Just use combination

2174
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:11,280
that so

2175
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,640
So here's the word

2176
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:15,960
In fact, Chinese medicine can be a kind of

2177
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,600
the therapy

2178
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,600
or because i learned a word

2179
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,120
Another person is interested in Chinese medicine

2180
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:24,880
he too

2181
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:25,960
Too

2182
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,320
is that he is totally

2183
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,080
evidence-based research scientist

2184
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:33,200
But he also intrigued

2185
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,400
He said this is complex formulation like this

2186
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:37,440
So by the end of the two probably will be in

2187
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,800
will be merge together

2188
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,560
Then I just talked about evidence-based

2189
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:42,880
It was just mentioned by the director

2190
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,720
is in fact

2191
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:46,280
That is to say

2192
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:47,400
In fact it is

2193
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,760
It is not said to be a real clinical trial

2194
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,320
But for thousands of years

2195
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,400
It's a trial

2196
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,480
so many years

2197
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:54,600
Xi Yiduo hasn't done it yet

2198
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,200
FDA approval can be obtained in about a few years

2199
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,760
But this has been done for thousands of years

2200
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:58,960
get some effective

2201
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,000
not all will work

2202
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,840
So my previous build looks like this

2203
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,340
maybe repeat what you said

2204
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:05,740
But I think when people live

2205
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:07,940
Learn my thoughts from you a little bit

2206
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:10,500
It feels really late today

2207
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:14,540
So let's try and talk more later

2208
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:16,640
Or we can set up a club to discuss this matter

2209
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,940
I'm sorry, of course I'd rather

2210
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:20,340
ask the professor

2211
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:23,340
Just now we talked about Chinese medicine and Western medicine

2212
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:27,000
In our impression, that is to say, most people

2213
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,600
modern scientific treatment

2214
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,400
Western medicine speed treatment is relatively fast

2215
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,900
Chinese medicine treatment appears to be more

2216
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:40,100
slower version slower better

2217
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:43,000
What kind of concept

2218
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,800
Is this thinking correct?

2219
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,000
Thanks

2220
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:51,500
Thank you, let me respond first

2221
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,500
The question raised by Liu Feiyang just now

2222
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,900
you just mentioned that

2223
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:58,080
that is to say ducong

2224
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,060
That is to say actually

2225
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,400
Yes, I think Du is smart

2226
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:05,600
Du Congming is actually on this matter

2227
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,600
he has a very scientific stance

2228
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,800
which means there is no doubt that we can feel

2229
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:15,200
He feels the value of traditional Chinese medicine or traditional Chinese medicine

2230
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,200
There's actually more to it than we know now

2231
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,200
So he wants to develop a new research method

2232
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,700
But how much he wasn't sure

2233
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:24,100
So he says there are three possible futures

2234
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,600
he was the first to say

2235
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,900
If you find a lot of value

2236
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,200
we really did

2237
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,800
That is to say, there is no Effidence

2238
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,500
We really do find a lot of value

2239
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,100
He said we should put it in medical school

2240
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:35,300
let students take electives

2241
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:37,700
It is the situation of the hospital of traditional Chinese medicine we just talked about

2242
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,200
The second is to say

2243
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:41,500
We found that only a few were valuable

2244
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,200
In fact, most of them are worthless

2245
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,500
Then a small part should be incorporated into western medicine.

2246
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,700
The third is that you find not only worthless

2247
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:48,700
many worthless

2248
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:49,900
And it's toxic

2249
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,900
He said you should quickly announce it to the public

2250
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:53,100
Tell everyone not to use

2251
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:55,000
He said that because everyone is busy using

2252
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,100
It's not good now

2253
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:59,800
So he actually has a pretty open stance.

2254
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,440
Now open to outside positions

2255
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:02,920
you can really feel it

2256
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:06,040
He thinks it's definitely worth more than we know now

2257
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:07,880
And now I know from Changshan's standpoint

2258
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:09,760
he does know

2259
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,360
Then he talked about massage, snake medicine, etc.

2260
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:15,120
So he should have some personal energy

2261
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:18,120
That is to say, the value is relatively high.

2262
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:20,360
Then this is connected to what you just said

2263
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:22,800
In fact, most of us now feel that

2264
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,360
Chinese medicine seems to be a chronic disease, right?

2265
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:28,200
It can be seen that Du Congming's move is infectious disease

2266
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,760
It means the saddle

2267
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,080
So in fact, at that time

2268
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:34,680
You think that when there is no Western medicine, Chinese medicine must be an acute disease

2269
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:37,960
Therefore, it is much slower than what we now teach Chinese medicine.

2270
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:42,000
Some are actually relative to this history after

2271
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,080
Because you have to compare with the pressure given to you by Western medicine

2272
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:50,400
You have to maintain an idea that you have created

2273
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:53,800
It's not exactly the original historical situation

2274
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:57,200
that's probably the case

2275
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,440
In addition, Chairman Liu Feihong, what you just mentioned is that

2276
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,400
In fact, it could be a problem of drug mixing.

2277
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:04,900
Christian Zongming specifically mentioned that

2278
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:06,400
not only did he say

2279
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,900
we can do it in reverse

2280
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:10,300
experimental therapeutics

2281
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:11,400
Then do it first on people

2282
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:13,600
And he said that unit medicine is not necessary

2283
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:14,800
he said he would

2284
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,700
He even gave many examples saying

2285
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,400
why he imagined

2286
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:21,000
The effect of the medicine after several medicines get together

2287
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,800
Possibility of altered potency

2288
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:24,800
So in this sense

2289
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,300
He did mention it early

2290
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:27,900
what we think today

2291
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,300
It is not necessary to pursue the goal of unit drug

2292
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:31,400
Then this point at the time

2293
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:34,500
Japan has begun to change

2294
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,500
that's probably sober

2295
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,700
right

2296
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:39,200
ask the professor

2297
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,100
Just now we said that poison

2298
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:45,200
That's what many of our concepts mean

2299
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,500
Many diseases sometimes require

2300
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:50,500
Fighting poison with poison isn't it?

2301
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:53,000
that is to say

2302
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,500
we have many cypresses

2303
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,600
Unified thoughts

2304
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,900
Many people think that traditional Chinese medicine is more

2305
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,340
Suitable for conditioning this vitality

2306
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:08,700
It is faster to use C1 to treat diseases

2307
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:11,000
Is this the right idea, thanks

2308
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:16,140
In fact, I think what you just said is very complicated and interesting.

2309
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:17,920
The first one is that your first sentence is actually

2310
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,500
Hu Ying, what the gentleman said just now is that if it is poisonous, right?

2311
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,300
So from a certain point of view it must be

2312
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:26,620
Must be toxic, use with care

2313
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:29,440
Then I remembered another thing you said, that is,

2314
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,740
In my research I have asked for advice that is

2315
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:36,360
Now to the Dean Zhang Henghong of Taichung Chinese Medical College

2316
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:40,700
At that time, he was the director of Changgen's Institute of Traditional Medicine

2317
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:44,800
He is promoting the notification system of adverse reactions of traditional Chinese medicine

2318
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,360
He said Taiwanese are

2319
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,400
is the most messy eater

2320
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,720
Because just saying it all has no side effects

2321
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:54,780
eat as food

2322
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:58,120
But in fact, if he was used as medicine before, it must be effective

2323
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,120
So in fact maybe I because I don't have one

2324
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,500
Notification system for adverse drug reactions

2325
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,600
so you don't know what bad effects it has

2326
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,300
So this is actually a

2327
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:07,300
I just said

2328
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,500
If you originally came to see the food therapy tradition of Chinese medicine

2329
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,000
Many are real

2330
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,700
I think this food can be used as medicine

2331
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,800
So some things you can't be careful about

2332
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,500
But now we feel like saying

2333
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:17,800
Chinese medicine is consistent with chronic

2334
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:18,500
all itchy

2335
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:20,000
Then did not eat fitness

2336
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
It's okay to eat

2337
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,300
That is to say, it is actually somewhat

2338
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:26,700
It wouldn't be what people thought a hundred years ago

2339
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:29,900
So the other way around

2340
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:31,600
For example, like the Dean Zhang Wenhong I just mentioned

2341
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,400
The adverse reaction system of traditional Chinese medicine that he wants to promote

2342
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:38,500
In fact, it is also equivalent to one of the modernization of traditional Chinese medicine.

2343
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,100
important step

2344
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:41,400
probably like this

2345
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:47,900
Dr Ray I'm sorry please

2346
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,300
i want to ask

2347
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:52,800
I just mentioned that young boy from that continent

2348
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,900
What part of the study is decantin

2349
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:58,000
it is this part of the research conduct program

2350
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,400
marry us or something

2351
01:33:59,400 --> 01:33:59,900
can you add

2352
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
let me compare to this

2353
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,600
where is he

2354
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,600
With our present set is

2355
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,600
relatively similar or

2356
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,100
he is part of some inspiration

2357
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,200
isn't it

2358
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:14,600
right

2359
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,100
because we didn't mention

2360
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:17,600
said he actually had

2361
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,100
it's me right

2362
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:20,000
because i'm a layman

2363
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:20,600
i don't know

2364
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,600
that is to say he

2365
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,400
Is there a certain part of the program

2366
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,000
There is also a breakthrough

2367
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
and come in from a different point of view

2368
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,400
i don't know much

2369
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,400
This time Nobel talks about his

2370
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:36,000
talk to one of our local

2371
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:38,200
may need to be supplemented

2372
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:40,200
let me know something

2373
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,200
Thank you

2374
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Thanks

2375
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Well actually you asked a very good question

2376
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
And it's a question I really want to know

2377
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
that's what i think you're feeling

2378
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
The story of the long mountain I just told

2379
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,000
There's a lot of element of surprise, right?

2380
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Very different from 12345

2381
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
But the story of Qinghaosu

2382
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Right now the act of righteousness is here

2383
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Because when Nobel speaks

2384
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
He is not awarded to Chinese medicine, right?

2385
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
He is awarded for the study of a modern science

2386
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
as if to say

2387
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
can happen anywhere

2388
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Research that any scientist can come and do

2389
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
And there are plenty of critics who will say

2390
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
This is actually the CCPâ€™s

2391
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
The needs of the Vietnam War

2392
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Invest a lot of resources in the country for auditions, right?

2393
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Then found a lot of drugs to conduct research

2394
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
This is completely a typical process of new drug development

2395
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Nothing to do with Chinese medicine

2396
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
So this is not Chinese medicine

2397
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
you just kinda wanted to ask me this

2398
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,020
so i'm going to be frank

2399
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:08,020
That is to say, because Tuyou TV is actually involved in the controversy over Shenwei's award

2400
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:11,520
So the information we have seen so far is not complete.

2401
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,220
But I can at least know a few things

2402
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:14,320
first thing to say

2403
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,860
We just told this story

2404
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:17,860
when this is not a political decision

2405
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:20,360
Then I said it like this

2406
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:24,060
Now, for example, after Tuyoushi happened

2407
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:26,060
If we look at the New York Times report

2408
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:29,440
would say that this is a typical scientific study

2409
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,440
nothing weird, right?

2410
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:34,940
If we take the story of Changshan just now as an example

2411
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:36,940
That doesn't sound like a typical science study

2412
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:39,940
Instead, it involves breakthroughs in some scientific research methods

2413
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:40,940
only results

2414
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:42,940
You ask me this question again, right?

2415
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:47,440
So now we put this story back into this history

2416
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:50,940
prompt people to start looking for

2417
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:52,940
Looking for anti-abuse drugs in China and Australia

2418
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:55,940
In fact, it is related to the atypical story of Changshan

2419
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:57,440
Then according to a

2420
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,940
Now why on earth would you find

2421
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,440
Ching Pao Su's story

2422
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,160
I recently read one that just came out

2423
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:07,960
That is, a verbal interview for this 523 plan

2424
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:10,440
Someone made a visit of hundreds of pages

2425
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:12,560
Then I read it and felt like saying

2426
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:14,400
And I think that's what the author intended

2427
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:17,680
That is to say, the credit is not

2428
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:20,080
It shouldn't be Tu Youyou

2429
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:22,400
Because to a large extent another scholar

2430
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:25,440
He quickly put this screened list

2431
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:28,120
reduced to a dozen miles

2432
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,760
Then it already contained the cleaning paraffin at that time

2433
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:32,920
And the scholar himself

2434
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:35,600
Doing this screening can effectively

2435
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,120
In the process of narrowing down the objects of screening

2436
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,240
A large part of him has been using Changshan since then.

2437
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:42,720
as a reference point

2438
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:43,760
in his opinion

2439
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:45,360
Because traditional Chinese medicine obviously

2440
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,240
Already found an effective drug against sadism

2441
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:49,960
so it's hard for him to imagine saying

2442
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:50,640
without

2443
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:52,280
later

2444
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:53,720
Maybe there will be later

2445
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,640
So he took the recipe with Changshan in it and took it away

2446
01:37:56,640 --> 01:38:00,000
Because of this, because those prescriptions are likely to mean

2447
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,300
is proven effective because of Chang Shan

2448
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:05,380
Then it is looking for the common ground in the middle

2449
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:07,160
and help it focus to

2450
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:10,500
That is to say, the study of Qinghaosu

2451
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:13,580
So my answer to your question just now is to say

2452
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:16,640
My answer to you just now is to say

2453
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:20,220
1. I donâ€™t have a story similar to Changshan to tell Haosu

2454
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:22,280
Because there's a lot of historical material for that story

2455
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:23,560
I have never seen

2456
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:26,620
But I based on oral interviews done by others

2457
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:28,920
A very detailed oral interview

2458
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:31,220
i think this thing

2459
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:33,520
At least part of it is

2460
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:37,620
At that time, Tuluo could quickly narrow down the screening

2461
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:39,920
When screening Chinese medicine items

2462
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:43,000
In fact, it is used

2463
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,820
That is to say, related to related matters

2464
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:48,120
But I can't explain the details more clearly.

2465
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:48,640
so

2466
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:51,200
So in the story just now, I can only say that there is no way

2467
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:53,760
Said that this is a story completely parallel to Changshan

2468
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,400
Teacher, I am very grateful for your speech today

2469
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,200
And so the story about Tu Youyou's Nobel Prize

2470
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:07,200
Then I want to add this paragraph

2471
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:10,000
In fact, the Nobel Prize was awarded to Tu Youyou at the same time

2472
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,400
Their works that won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine that year

2473
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,800
Also included was awarded to Mork for his original invention

2474
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:18,000
It's the medicine for blindness in Africa.

2475
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,400
Right, and so the Nobel Prize committee judges

2476
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,400
They themselves said they didn't award those two drugs

2477
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:26,000
they awarded

2478
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,600
In fact, what they're awarding is the method that actually discovered the drug in the first place.

2479
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:33,200
Then 10 years ago, the academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences opposed

2480
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:36,000
it's important

2481
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,600
But in fact, they should not have the academicians of Academia Sinica to remember

2482
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,200
During the Cultural Revolution

2483
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:44,400
Then those were sent out of the mainland

2484
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,600
Then to those chemists in America

2485
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:52,000
In fact, many of them were taken in by Mokda Pharmaceuticals' laboratory in New York.

2486
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Yes, and in fact, Mokda and the others are very interested in Chinese medicine.

2487
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Then they also silently protect this piece

2488
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
yes then so

2489
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,600
Then the award to Tuyouyou should be in 2011

2490
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:05,960
Then other recapitalization at that time

2491
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:07,760
Because he is actually very interested in making medicine

2492
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:08,960
Yes and he is also right

2493
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,840
He is interested in making vaccines and then public health

2494
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:12,200
He is very interested in making medicine

2495
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:14,040
And then they already said

2496
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:16,200
In fact, it should be awarded to China

2497
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:17,640
It's the Chinese medicine

2498
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:18,960
Yes, then who will it be awarded to?

2499
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,960
At that time, I actually thought of Tuyouyou at first.

2500
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:23,000
But it's not because he invented

2501
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,640
one word sadism drug

2502
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:26,560
because what they really want to praise is

2503
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:30,240
The quick help in traditional Chinese medicine

2504
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:31,600
how do you tell the difference

2505
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:33,160
how are we going to stuff it

2506
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:35,160
Those who have been tired by the Lord for thousands of years

2507
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,840
The Chinese advocate the wisdom of getting tired first

2508
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:41,800
What they're actually giving awards for is that set of things

2509
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:44,240
Yeah, and because there's a lot of politics involved

2510
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:45,840
you can't tell the truth

2511
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,440
We want to praise those who because Wenger

2512
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:51,240
those assets that were then sent to the United States

2513
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:54,000
Yes, so I can only tell everyone

2514
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,120
what we want to commend is

2515
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,040
can help you quickly find

2516
01:40:58,040 --> 01:40:59,560
Approaches to new drug development

2517
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:00,040
this set

2518
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
That's Nobel's Lecture

2519
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
They said it themselves

2520
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
I haven't heard

2521
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
and such words

2522
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
This story is the opposite of what we usually hear

2523
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
right

2524
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
these actually exist

2525
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
And there are people who will remember this passage

2526
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Because who protected those chemists in the first place?

2527
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
top decision-makers

2528
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
In fact, there are still people from this world

2529
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
right then

2530
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
So these stories are

2531
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
someone is willing to admit

2532
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Then they can

2533
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
was recorded

2534
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
then in fact

2535
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Nobel talks about how they award

2536
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Meaning they want to speed up

2537
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
New steps to be developed

2538
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
because now everyone says

2539
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
new development

2540
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,260
The process is too long

2541
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:02,960
Then it's because the process is too long

2542
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:05,600
So the price of new drugs will become very expensive

2543
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:07,100
then you get expensive

2544
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:08,800
No matter how good the medicine you make

2545
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,600
And then the problem is that it becomes a new drug

2546
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:11,640
we can't afford it

2547
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:13,600
every country says so

2548
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,700
Right, and so in fact what they want to change is

2549
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:19,800
This whole thing is almost on the verge of collapse.

2550
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:21,300
health care and medicine system

2551
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:25,500
thanks i'm very interested

2552
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:27,060
I hope you will provide me with that information later

2553
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:29,400
Because I don't know what you just said

2554
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:31,700
Then my impression is quite different

2555
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:33,500
so i'm curious to know more

2556
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:34,300
Thanks

2557
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:36,000
Teacher, if I have found the information

2558
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,100
i can send you a letter

2559
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:38,300
Okay, thank you

2560
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:42,200
teacher this gentleman

2561
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:44,200
Teacher, thank you for this talk

2562
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:47,800
In fact, your article is about Teacher Du Congming

2563
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:49,600
I got it by accident

2564
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,200
Then I just want to ask a question, that is

2565
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:55,700
There is an appreciation for Chinese medicine formed by Dr. Du Congming

2566
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:59,600
Then continue the research on medicines and medicines

2567
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:00,600
the idea

2568
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Are you sure about the idea? Are there any related materials now?

2569
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Explain that in fact, his thinking has actually changed.

2570
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,000
For example, he might be like Mr. Fussian from before

2571
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Or a person like Mr. Sun Zhongan who upholds this careless position

2572
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Itâ€™s just that he was like what Mr. Li you just said, he may have some experience in life

2573
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,000
or some of his scientific intuition or something

2574
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Or it is such a belief in Chinese medicine in this battlefield formed by his Open Minded

2575
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Is there a set of relevant materials that can be searched for again?

2576
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
How did he form a process of talking about traditional Chinese medicine on the battlefield

2577
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Actually, I think this is Mr. Li, your speech today is very interesting.

2578
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
In fact, I think that in daily life, everyone will face

2579
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Especially including yourself or relatives or friends

2580
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
When they face this kind of B-Pool of disease

2581
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
will still face this so-called dispute between Chinese and Western medicine.

2582
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Including the treatment of the recent colorectal cancer of Mr. Su Geliang

2583
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,000
In fact, we can also clearly see that one is a pancake.

2584
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
I don't want to go to Western medicine again

2585
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Another position is that

2586
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
probably in the modernized this

2587
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Under this generality of modernity

2588
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
I just insist on western medicine and I don't accept it

2589
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Such an award for variety shows

2590
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
so i was thinking

2591
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
In fact, as far as I am concerned

2592
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
when myself

2593
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Make this medical decision for yourself

2594
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
or for example parents

2595
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
make such medical decisions

2596
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
I still feel like saying

2597
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I should still be

2598
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Looking for this western doctor

2599
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Such a normal pipeline

2600
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
For example, in the context of this treatment

2601
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Follow the path of Western medicine

2602
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Because at least for Chinese medicine

2603
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
i may not understand

2604
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Or just don't have that much

2605
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
say maybe for some kind of cancer

2606
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
or gastroenteritis or something

2607
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
such an unusual disease

2608
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Then does Chinese medicine have to have curative effect?

2609
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Actually I don't

2610
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
If and when I have the right to make this decision

2611
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
I would actually be like

2612
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Mr. Fu Silin or Mr. Lu Xun said the same

2613
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,000
I won't make that decision

2614
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
But in the daily health care or food

2615
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Maybe we will often drink bitter tea

2616
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
or herbal tea

2617
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
but those are

2618
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
The Doubtful Orders of Traditional Chinese Medicine

2619
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,000
I feel like I can do it again

2620
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:00,960
such an absorption

2621
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:02,500
So actually answer one

2622
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:03,360
it's fun

2623
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:04,460
This dispute between China and the West

2624
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:06,160
like before i thought

2625
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:07,460
It seems that it is also in life

2626
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:08,460
inspired by something

2627
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:09,500
just remind me of that

2628
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:10,700
Academician Tian Changning talked about

2629
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:13,060
He said that he felt micro-learning was going to extremes

2630
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:14,460
Is the research to do extreme

2631
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:15,500
Pursue excellence

2632
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:17,900
It seems to be moderate on Weiren

2633
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:19,260
But for us now

2634
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:20,000
From the point of view of the present

2635
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,360
It seems to be a straight line development

2636
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,600
That is to say, everything about me is actually

2637
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:24,800
just go to the extreme

2638
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:25,920
to pursue excellence

2639
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:28,420
But in another category

2640
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:29,460
For example, between people

2641
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:30,260
that treat each other

2642
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:31,260
it seems to go again

2643
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:32,860
what we call oriental wisdom

2644
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:34,060
treat each other

2645
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:37,060
Then in these two cultures

2646
01:45:37,060 --> 01:45:38,500
In fact, when I was faced with a

2647
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,060
I'm going to make this sick

2648
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:41,000
able to be cured

2649
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,500
or make this

2650
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:45,960
I can push this thing further

2651
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:46,760
or people care about me

2652
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:48,300
when you can get along

2653
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:49,200
In fact, what we focus on

2654
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:50,260
is the same thing

2655
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:51,260
just say in the method

2656
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:52,200
or conceptually

2657
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:53,800
is there a difference

2658
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:55,960
But in fact

2659
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:58,200
I'm fighting a judgment now

2660
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:00,000
I don't know what Mr. Lei thinks about this

2661
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,400
Do you have any opinion on this?

2662
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:02,700
thanks for these two questions

2663
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:06,100
The first question is to say

2664
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:11,700
We currently have very limited data

2665
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
That means I can't rebuild

2666
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
That is why it has such an idea

2667
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:18,600
But it should be the period of early rule with Taiwan

2668
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:21,100
The history of Chinese medicine in Taiwan at the beginning has a lot to do with it

2669
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:22,500
that is to say actually

2670
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:25,300
At that time, those Chinese medicine practitioners were the first to come into contact with

2671
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:27,700
That is to say, people trained in modern science

2672
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,600
But we rarely talk about this part now

2673
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,800
Most of our history of medicine during the Japanese period is about

2674
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,800
The history of Western medicine rarely talks about the history of Chinese medicine

2675
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:36,000
So this part is still very under under study

2676
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:37,400
but i feel that

2677
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:40,100
You can feel strongly from Du Congming's story

2678
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:43,400
He he he got inspiration with him over there

2679
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,100
Then his discourse

2680
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:46,600
Because later it can't be realized

2681
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:49,600
So there's really no way to trace his development.

2682
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:51,200
Then we can read him another

2683
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:53,400
I just talked about the class he gave after he went to the freshman year of high school

2684
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:54,700
historical materials left behind

2685
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:55,700
but I

2686
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,700
But I, I, I also doubt

2687
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,300
Still can't fully answer your question

2688
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:06,300
Then your next question is to say

2689
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:11,300
To supplement the one just now about

2690
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:14,100
The significance of Ms. Tuyouyou's award in 15 years

2691
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:17,500
In fact, I should actually say that I was

2692
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,300
I'm going to test that Yangming business

2693
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:21,400
The name is Luochunshan, and then I went to study physiology

2694
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:23,300
So basically I'm in the background of Physiology

2695
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:24,300
rather than the background of the catechism

2696
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:26,600
But that award-winning story of the young lady

2697
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:28,500
just let me at least from the media

2698
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:30,600
It can be seen from relevant information

2699
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:31,500
first sure

2700
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,300
The Nobel is to be awarded to that party

2701
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:35,300
It is the method of extracting Qinghao tree

2702
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:36,700
The reason for that method

2703
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:38,300
According to Ms.

2704
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:40,000
It is the one from the Northern and Southern Dynasties

2705
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,300
Ge Hong's book about clothes

2706
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:45,500
Then he compared him with this modern

2707
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,500
scientific knowledge connects it

2708
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:49,700
That's why the Qinghao tree was able to come out

2709
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:51,000
I think this is a supplement

2710
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,100
as if to say

2711
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:55,500
But for Ms. Tuyouyou's winner

2712
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:56,700
he will feel that yes

2713
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:57,700
Nobel

2714
01:47:57,700 --> 01:48:00,000
The Nobel Prize is to honor this China and North Korea

2715
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,320
But for the Nobel Committee

2716
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:03,520
it's not actually

2717
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:06,400
It actually shows that, as the New York Times puts it,

2718
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:09,040
is that it is actually an ordinary scientific study

2719
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:11,600
found a new drug

2720
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,760
in an innovative way

2721
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,320
Found a drug that is extremely effective against abusers

2722
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,840
So these two seem

2723
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:21,000
Maybe it's right for Tu Nv

2724
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:21,720
As far as native girls are concerned

2725
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:23,760
Its interpretation of the study goes like this

2726
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:26,360
Westerners have different ideas from Westerners

2727
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:28,000
Just to make such a supplement

2728
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,000
so you said

2729
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
yes, that's what i think

2730
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
the rights of others

2731
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Then you just said

2732
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
It learned from Ge Hong

2733
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
That is to say, one foot has limbs

2734
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
So I thought of low temperature extraction

2735
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
that this is indeed relevant

2736
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
but if so

2737
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
This connection is also weak, isn't it?

2738
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:51,000
That is to say, it is probably like this

2739
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
But I'm going the other way

2740
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
The one behind you just spoke longer

2741
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Then there is the question of

2742
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
I turned it into another related question

2743
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
that is

2744
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
you see my story

2745
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
My stories are all about success

2746
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
right

2747
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Then others can say the other way around

2748
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Then you know that Du Congming will drive a few more

2749
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Will our research be successful right away?

2750
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
I don't think Du Congming will be so sure

2751
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
So there are critics who say

2752
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
For example, the young lady just mentioned that someone went to Merc, right?

2753
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
In fact, the one I just talked about in Xiehe Hospital

2754
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Then they made ephedrine

2755
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Ephedrine can cure asthma

2756
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
And that was the general period of the Republic of China

2757
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Research considered a true breakthrough

2758
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
He was later poached by the Lilai Pharmaceutical Factory

2759
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
as their research director

2760
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Then he became the first academician of Academia Sinica

2761
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
So that's actually another person

2762
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
But after he went to reason

2763
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
we didn't hear that

2764
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Another big breakthrough, right?

2765
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
then why

2766
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Logically speaking, we imagined

2767
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
he got to a place

2768
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Lilai Pharmaceutical Factory fully supports him

2769
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Then he became the director for decades

2770
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,000
best environment

2771
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Why is there no research result?

2772
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
So someone would say the other way around

2773
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
maybe there's something of value over there

2774
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,000
but something of value

2775
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Maybe not as much as we think

2776
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I'm sorry everyone today

2777
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I have been trying to repeat the positions of both sides in

2778
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
keep him active in our minds over and over again

2779
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
because i feel like i said

2780
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
This period of history is indeed still developing and controversial.

2781
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Even Du Congming would take a

2782
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
The hope that is embraced and the attitude that overcomes the fear

2783
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Then I personally stand in this position

2784
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
to write this history

2785
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,000
so i feel like saying

2786
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
I am indeed the same as Du Congming

2787
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,000
because of hope

2788
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
So I will study these seriously

2789
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
History of Proven Success

2790
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
so that the kind of origin of our story

2791
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:34,000
I think it is because based on the development of science now

2792
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
The old thing was that we completely broke with him

2793
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
he must be worthless

2794
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
There is absolutely no need to give up

2795
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
I think that position is problematic

2796
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
But does it mean

2797
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
On the other side there is a very large vault

2798
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
or a completely different way of thinking

2799
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:53,000
That is to say, this is another question

2800
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
then i don't...

2801
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,000
That's me as a history student

2802
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
I want to be special...

2803
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
In particular, take a more cautious stance

2804
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
to discover the attitudes of this study

2805
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
So I deliberately echo everyone's opinions on the one hand.

2806
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
On the other hand, some opposing opinions

2807
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Come for your reference

2808
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
OK nothing else

2809
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
question

2810
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
yes over there

2811
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Let me reply to the paragraph just now

2812
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
That is to say, one of our partners just talked about

2813
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,000
just need some time to use

2814
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Other unapproved medicines are effective

2815
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Then this part actually you push it back

2816
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,000
This is also the biggest advantage in Chinese medicine

2817
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
I just have used it for thousands of years

2818
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,000
there are some medicines

2819
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,000
It has produced some clinical effects

2820
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,000
That's confirmed that its possible interactions won't kill

2821
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
So on such a basis

2822
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,000
If it is developed from its medicinal effect

2823
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
find out which part of the word it might work

2824
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
The so-called reverse research

2825
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
it becomes ill to soto

2826
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
How many people do you have to die to find a new drug

2827
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
this may be one of the

2828
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
I think Han Yi is in the research

2829
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
He made me a data base

2830
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
a good starting point

2831
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
I suddenly thought of someone I could ask you for advice

2832
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,000
It is an open trial that has been done for thousands of years in the past

2833
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
open trial is also

2834
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:27,000
And now I think itâ€™s time to do double blind placebo

2835
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:31,000
So I did this in Xili

2836
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
it is open

2837
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Or open lab use

2838
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
or it was the beginning

2839
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
try to see if it works

2840
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
It was open at that time

2841
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
so in fact

2842
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:47,000
I also said that the history above helped to open it

2843
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
think it works

2844
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Otherwise there is no evidence at all

2845
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
say try it

2846
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
not like this

2847
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
so i think over here he sees this

2848
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
So in fact there is quite a lot of evidence

2849
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
this is very promising

2850
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
he wants to push

2851
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:00,960
you'll talk about it later

2852
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:03,920
I just want to learn my experience

2853
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:04,840
is sorry

2854
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:06,120
I want to go back to that big brother Bran just now

2855
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:07,520
I want to study the law

2856
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:10,000
We cannot fall into this Western medicine

2857
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,360
that subject

2858
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:13,120
Because of traditional Chinese medicine, make Dazu Bolan

2859
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:15,120
it has an inherent difficulty

2860
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:16,840
i just wanted to say yes

2861
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:18,320
This is Western medicine with that

2862
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:20,120
Then you have to do Cleaner Trial

2863
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:21,360
Cleaner Trial words

2864
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,920
In fact, the traditional Chinese medicine

2865
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:25,920
how to do the best

2866
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,280
i'm not here to discuss

2867
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:28,160
i just say yes

2868
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:29,280
In fact it is

2869
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:30,600
If it was him

2870
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:32,600
When people criticize

2871
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:34,440
He said it's actually been done

2872
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:36,560
It's not like experimenting on humans

2873
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:37,880
Then you are an experiment

2874
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:39,760
He actually doesn't have this at all

2875
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:40,400
suddenly remembered

2876
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:41,400
This seems to be useful today

2877
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:42,640
no evidence

2878
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:43,760
I just talked about Evidence

2879
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:44,920
Actually maybe not

2880
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:47,560
But for thousands of years

2881
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:49,440
there is

2882
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,960
It made him feel confident

2883
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:53,920
So the point is

2884
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:57,840
Maybe I didn't get Appreciation from others at the beginning

2885
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:58,960
but maybe this is the reason

2886
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
will try to push over there

2887
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:06,000
What I was going to say just now is the double-blind talk

2888
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:10,000
In Chinese medicine, because the medicine in Chinese medicine has its own taste

2889
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
So if we use the method of Western medicine to study

2890
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Can't use double blind

2891
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Because the patient knows that the taste is different

2892
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:20,000
But if it is Chinese medicine

2893
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
do you want to ask you

2894
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
That is to say, it is Chinese medicine, right?

2895
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Or should we go to the scientific side?

2896
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
If it is extracted

2897
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
that's more hopeful

2898
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
If you use scientific Chinese medicine, that step is fine.

2899
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
It should be going that way

2900
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
the shorter the distance

2901
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
At present, scientific Chinese medicine has a certain evalence

2902
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
over there

2903
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
That is to say, there are some schemes to do it this way.

2904
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
it does work

2905
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Okay, so we're running out of time.

2906
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
so i think

2907
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,000
I will first enounce

2908
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,000
It's the next month next time

2909
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
just support

2910
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,460
The program I want to try is in October

2911
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:06,300
It's our side

2912
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:09,000
Cai Dingping of the hard science center of Songyuan Academy

2913
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,620
Special Review Researcher and Director

2914
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:13,420
Lecturer on this new era of photonics

2915
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:15,420
should be a very good speech

2916
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:18,420
I hope you will sign up

2917
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:21,200
OK then we are very grateful this time

2918
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:23,420
Dr. Ray shared with us this

2919
01:55:23,420 --> 01:55:25,620
This is a very wonderful historical story

2920
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:27,120
we have a lot to inspire

2921
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:30,120
There's a lot to think about

2922
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:32,120
Is it a round of applause? Thank you.

2923
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:33,120
Thank him
