1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
If the

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,100
,​

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Academia Sinica's November Knowledge Feast Lectures began.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Wang Hansheng, vice president, hosted for us.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Director Li Jie, Dear Distinguished Guests, Dear Friends

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's because Vice President Chen

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
have my agent

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Dr. Mingzhe is the Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center of our hospital

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Special Forces researcher and director are the agricultural and biological center

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He graduated from the Biology Department of Tunghai University in 1976

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In 1978, he studied genetics at the University of Elva

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
After getting a Ph.D. in 1983

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Postdoctoral research at Harvard University

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
In 1988, he returned to the Biology Department of the University of Elva to teach

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Later served as a professor of biology at the school

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and Director of the Center for Comparative Genomes

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
After 20 years at the University of Elva

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
in January 2008

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Apply back to our hospital as the Agricultural Biotechnology Center

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Special Forces Researcher and Director

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And served as the forward-looking translation of the hospital

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Chief host of the Agricultural Cooperative Program

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,540
Director Shi's expertise is in applied molecular biology

24
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,540
and comparative genomics methods

25
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,540
To explore the function of genes in plants and vitamins

26
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,540
and the mechanism of message transmission

27
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,840
His current focus is on plant

28
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,840
Molecular Mechanism of Flooding Response

29
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,340
There is also the impact of environmental changes on Taiwan's downturn

30
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,300
And the color and fragrance of Phalaenopsis orchid

31
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,300
gene regulatory network

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,300
He also integrates cross-school teams

33
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,300
Construction of Taiwan Agricultural Genome Database

34
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,800
According to my observation, after Director Shi came back in 2008

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,800
He played great organization

36
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
follow the power of mobilization

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,300
In fact, Taiwan's related research fields

38
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,300
quite different

39
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,300
Form many cross-school teams

40
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,300
and lead many large projects

41
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
Also on behalf of Congress to promote Taiwan

42
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,300
with the EU in the field of agricultural biotechnology

43
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
Science and Technology Exchange and Cooperation

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,820
And it is also the agricultural policy of Academia Sinica in 102 years

45
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,220
Planning committee with scientific and technological research proposals

46
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,800
The topic he is going to talk about today is

47
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,720
Sustainable Development of Taiwan's Agriculture

48
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,760
we welcome him with warm applause

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,700
Thank you, Vice President Wang, Dean Li

50
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,260
Secretary-General Wu and distinguished guests

51
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,700
that's great to have the chance today

52
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,460
Let's exchange opinions with you

53
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,600
That is, I am actually a wedding paper creature.

54
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,200
The agricultural policy towards Taiwan is 2008

55
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,100
I have a chance when I come back to Taiwan

56
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,400
That's how we got to know Taiwan

57
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,200
The situation of agricultural development

58
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,100
that has some personal thoughts

59
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,000
that's great to have the chance today

60
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,800
I can discuss with you

61
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,600
then i will put my speech on the wedding schedule

62
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,900
Three parts of the big column marriage

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,100
the first is

64
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,800
Discuss issues related to Taiwan's current agricultural policy

65
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,900
Then in the middle I'll bring up

66
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,100
means I go

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Do you think there are any ways we can improve these agricultural policies

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
can solve these problems

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and then the last part

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Can you hear me?

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll get to the last part

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In fact, the real problem we have to face

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That is the impact of global warming on Taiwan's agriculture

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
what impact will it have

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Then how do we solve it

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That...

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
a little louder

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
that...

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
help me fix it

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
seems to be broken

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
May I

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
ok

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
we should be...

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
ok sorry

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
ok then we can start

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The Academia Sinica regularly

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That is to say, it is important to our country

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
technology or social issues

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
make suggestions

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That is usually the dean

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
to form a committee

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hiring experts inside and outside the hospital

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,740
Then do the so-called policy white paper

94
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,440
In 102, Academia Sinica published a book called

95
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,340
"Agricultural Policy Building Books with Science and Technology"

96
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,340
The book is really thin

97
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,940
If you are interested

98
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,740
It can be exposed from the network of our Academia Sinica

99
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,840
But this book is thin

100
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,440
Among them, only our Taiwan is currently

101
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,580
Structural Problems in "Agriculture Facing"

102
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,280
There are six questions in total

103
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,980
But one of them refers to

104
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,780
Our old farmer's allowance has become a political bargaining chip in the election

105
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,480
As a result, the book was published

106
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,780
The next day the newspaper published a lot of news

107
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,980
I won't talk about most of the content

108
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,940
Most of the scholars of Academia Sinica are hiding in the laboratory

109
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,340
I don't know the sufferings of the people

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,520
This is a relatively mild criticism.

111
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,180
Zhang Huaguan, the magistrate of Chiayi County, is

112
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,880
Xi Xiaolong is big big today

113
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,980
He has one last sentence not in it

114
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,720
i saw him on tv saying

115
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,120
peasants will riot

116
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,420
So let me start with this question

117
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,600
i watch tv in america

118
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,160
One of my favorites is called

119
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,260
BioNumber

120
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,860
Just use trees to explain the problem

121
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,780
So I'm going to start giving you guys

122
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,260
talk about some trees

123
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,780
This old farmer is the first one to look forward to history today

124
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,860
In the 84th year of the Republic of China

125
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,460
It's the so-called our government's economy took off at that time

126
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,980
Plus the WTO issue

127
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,180
So there will be imported food

128
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,100
So our government will

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,960
So it's kind of like rewarding our old farmers

130
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,960
So he set up a so-called welfare allowance for elderly farmers

131
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,320
But a law called the Battle Form

132
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,320
The so-called combat regulations are temporary and transitional

133
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,720
In the future there will be a more permanent legislation to take care of our old farmers

134
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,920
In the 1987 of the Republic of China

135
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,600
It is said that it will be included in the so-called national pension system

136
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,120
In July 1996, the legislation was actually passed

137
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,560
Once the legislation is passed, it will be implemented in January 1997

138
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,920
Then the implementation of this announcement is to bring the old farmer's pension into the right track of the national pension system

139
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,800
But in July 1997

140
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,040
Our Legislative Yuan Passed Old Farmer's Pension to Restore the Old System

141
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,280
through the National Pension

142
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,040
So it's back to the Battle Form Regulations

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This battle is up to now

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Before July 103

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll tell you what happens after July

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Before 7 months old farmers today's application qualifications

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes, as long as you have been insured for agricultural insurance for 6 months

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
If you are over 65 years old, you can receive it for life

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
At the beginning of today, the old farmer paid 3,000 yuan a month

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The Democratic Progressive Party increased the price to 5,000 yuan, and the KMT increased the price to 7,000 yuan a month

151
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So when you are 64 and a half years old, you buy rural insurance

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
From the age of 65, you will receive 7,000 yuan a month for life

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Later, after Chen Baoji became the chairman of the Council of Agriculture

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He tried to improve the old farmer's pension

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So he introduced a bill and it didn't pass

156
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So then it became a thing

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He just passed a person named Laolong last year

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Amendment to Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations on Old Dragon Allowance

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
just one amendment

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That is to say, if you have received the old dragon's allowance before the practice, it will be the same as usual.

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You after July 103

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You need 15 years of rural insurance

163
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So he extended six months to 15 years

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
To be able to spend the thousand-amount Laolong subsidy of 7,000 yuan

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Then you feed six months for 15 years

166
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
half price

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Wait until the seniority reaches 15 years before spending the thousand amount

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So this solves half of the problem

169
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Because these have been received

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You can see how big our country's burden is

171
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This is me from our Republic of China

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Annual budget book Council of Agriculture's budget

173
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
you can go

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
to that Taipei network

175
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
every year for the past ten years

176
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
you put it in

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This is the Council of Agriculture

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
you don't count it the one

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
reserve fund

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
this is its total budget

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
almost every year

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
100 billion up and down

183
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
look at everyone

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
How much does the old farmer's annuity cost each year

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
50 billion or so

186
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So the COA's budget

187
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
at least half

188
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Spend directly on the old farmer's annuity

189
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But it's more than that

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
look at everyone

191
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
there is an item

192
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
COAG Development Lecture Subsidy

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This talk about subsidy is not about

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
is a subsidy

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
List of agricultural losses in Taiwan

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
then any

197
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Special for any township need

198
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What's up with the poker bit

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
it's all in there

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
look at everyone

201
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
From 16 billion to 39.2 billion

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So the subsidy from the Council of Agriculture

203
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
about 80 percent a year

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
used for subsidies

205
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,440
If you only have 20 billion

206
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,280
No matter how good your agricultural policy is

207
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
you can never do things

208
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,040
If it's just a matter of the old farmer's pension

209
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,840
Then maybe if we change the old farmer's pension regulations

210
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,280
that can be solved

211
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,880
look at

212
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,640
we have other questions

213
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,840
the first is

214
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,240
Our Agricultural Pruning Questions

215
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,960
You probably often see it in the newspapers

216
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,560
But in fact, the original benefit was not only root cultivation

217
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,080
that now becomes

218
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,200
Look at the area from our water to Taiwan's seeds now

219
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,560
About 250,000 hectares

220
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,280
Our paddy fields are about 220,000 hectares

221
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,800
That is to say, about half and half

222
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,640
Only half of the farmland is in use

223
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,000
half in pruning

224
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,520
We subsidize root trimming every year

225
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,680
Are you in that old farmer's pension?

226
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,560
another 10 billion

227
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,080
It's in the Jiang subsidy

228
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,600
There are other sub-items

229
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
A total of 10 billion in subsidy each year

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Well, if you have these figures, these subsidies are really subsidizing farmers, that's fine.

231
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Everyone, take a look, this is the top five subsidies in the country published by the United Daily News

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The farmland they own, the money that has been subsidized by Xiu Geun for the past five years

233
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
These people are not farmers, these people are investing in farmland

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Therefore, many subsidies from our government have not actually reached the hands of farmers.

235
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
but in the hands of some speculative class

236
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Well, if you look at the source of the original root repair policy

237
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Actually there are two parts

238
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
In the 73rd year of the Republic of China, he actually wanted to teach farmers to cultivate their roots.

239
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That transfer means

240
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,800
accept government grants

241
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,600
fallow that year

242
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,800
The right to use your farmland

243
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,000
to the Council of Agriculture

244
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
integrated by COA

245
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,200
distributed to other yeoman

246
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,000
Or go to the so-called small landlords

247
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,800
The concept of small landlords and big electricity farmers

248
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,400
This is how young people can be encouraged to grow chairs

249
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,400
In fact, this idea has existed since the Republic of China in 1973

250
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,000
But this law entered the Legislative Yuan

251
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,600
fallow still

252
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
transfer to see

253
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
so

254
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,200
31 years later

255
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
we still have only fallow

256
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
not converted

257
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,400
Guys, don't think your fields are fallow

258
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,000
put it there

259
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,400
It will not affect

260
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,800
nothing

261
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,400
after fallow

262
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,100
if you don't take care of it

263
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,700
that place will

264
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,300
There will be pet pests and diseases, rodents

265
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,500
anything

266
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,300
So what you made is that farmland

267
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,000
you do not need

268
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So pruning for too long will destroy your field

269
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And where are you pruning our excess power?

270
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
cause social problems

271
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Because if there is no place to use the strong power in the countryside

272
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Naturally, social problems will arise

273
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,000
When we were discussing this white paper,

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Some committee members said that Taiwan is like kidney dialysis.

275
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's because he listens to underground radio commercials in rural areas

276
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
just took a lot of medicine

277
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Another Mark Six lottery may also be redundant in rural areas

278
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But this is actually Starly who didn’t do it carefully

279
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
so just listen

280
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But it will cause rural police officers and rural social problems

281
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
absolutely no problem

282
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
if that's all

283
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,800
created yet another law

284
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,400
continuous evil

285
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Because in 1989

286
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Our organization has made an amendment called the Agricultural Flower Regulations

287
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,400
This is in my opinion the worst agricultural policy ever

288
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,900
because it's the first

289
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,900
It widens farmland acquisition restrictions

290
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,400
In the past, it was not very profitable for you to buy and sell farmland.

291
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
You must be qualified as a farmer

292
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
You will pass it on to your descendants who will also be farmers

293
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Therefore, the inheritance of agricultural land is always under the hands of farmers

294
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,400
And it changed

295
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,400
natural person can take over the farmland

296
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Natural persons are our personal inheritance of farmland

297
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,400
If a farmer wants to sell land, you can buy it

298
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Natural people have to bear

299
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,400
Second, it allows agribusiness corporations

300
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Conditional inheritance of farmland

301
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,240
The company you call yourself an agribusiness

302
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,740
then you can buy land

303
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,740
So it is equal to the free sale of agricultural land

304
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,740
The worst thing is

305
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,940
Before Xiuhua, you have to buy and sell farmland

306
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,540
You are not allowed to cut it into small pieces

307
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,740
You must have more than five hectares

308
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,740
but this bill

309
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:25,140
it revised it down from five hectares to 0.25 hectares

310
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,940
So you can start mowing your farmland now

311
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,680
cut a little

312
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,940
0.25 hectares is about 750 square meters

313
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:39,180
Section 18 of the Farm Digging Regulations Amendment

314
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,180
I added this

315
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,180
in it this law

316
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,680
Those who acquire farmland for 1.4 billion yuan are called farmers

317
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,680
Actually no matter how old you are

318
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,680
As long as you have this land before

319
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,680
You don't care about the size of the farmland

320
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
you can change the farmhouse

321
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
The idea of ​​the farmhouse is you because you farm

322
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,680
So you build on top of your farmland

323
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,680
call definition

324
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
but after january 89 you acquire farm land

325
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
They are called Xinnong

326
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Need to obtain more than 0.25 hectares

327
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And it will take two years before the construction of agricultural works

328
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
This looks like a good policy

329
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
That is to say, you can't be anywhere

330
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You can't build a house right after you sell the farmland

331
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
but you have countermeasures

332
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
We Taiwanese must have countermeasures

333
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
this is the worst

334
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It will be built after two years

335
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Why

336
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
because you're the one who buys and sells land

337
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
If he wants to sell it to others to build a house

338
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Then if people have to wait two years

339
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Of course he won't come to buy

340
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
so they figured out

341
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Still Farmland Goushe Weird Phenomena

342
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It covers a small probably

343
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I think it's really like a kennel

344
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Everyone, if you go to Yilan, you will see a kennel

345
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I think many people probably don't know why they cover this

346
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
because it can sell land

347
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
If you buy this person

348
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
people of this land

349
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
because it already has

350
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
This is called a ready-made farmhouse

351
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
it can apply for extension

352
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It can be expanded to the villa it wants

353
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
so

354
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The front looks as if it could be prevented

355
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It is the misuse of farmland that has become this

356
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Then everyone, go through the Beiyi Highway

357
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
you can see

358
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's called a kind of house, a kind of kennel

359
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
one by one like this

360
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
these are all

361
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
In preparation for the subdivision of farmland

362
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Land for sale as a villa

363
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,440
The consequences of these agricultural policies

364
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,160
Amendment to Agrochemical Regulations

365
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,360
It trades farmland subdivision restrictions

366
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,960
There are also qualifications for agricultural property construction

367
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,480
So good farmland is lost quickly

368
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
The production environment is also polluted

369
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,920
and the worst

370
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,200
You probably don't know the definition of our peasant

371
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,360
what is a farmer

372
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,960
My hunch is that you must have farmed

373
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,280
farming, right?

374
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,320
But the census we do

375
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,000
Every five years we do something called the agricultural census

376
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,440
if i tell you

377
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,520
From the ninety-nine years of the Republic of China

378
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,080
From ninety-four to ninety-nine

379
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,400
Our farm households increase by one percent

380
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,560
do you believe it

381
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,240
If you believe me there is a house on Mars that will sell you

382
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,200
that peaceful age of our farmers

383
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,680
Sixty-seven-year-old real Bunon's frontier

384
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Therefore, in the past 10 or 20 years, there has been absolutely no increase in farmers in Taiwan.

385
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Look at the census from that time, I think it's an underestimate

386
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
40% of the so-called qualified farmers have never worked in the fields all their lives

387
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
not engaged in farming

388
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
so this

389
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Therefore, if you obtain the qualification as a farmer

390
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
If both Yilan County and the Council of Agriculture want to restrict

391
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The condition for obtaining the qualification as a farmer

392
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But it means a lot of resistance

393
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
come down and listen to my

394
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So now it's 2015

395
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
The organizing committee of Chen Baoji is very determined to do something

396
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Including the government of Yilan County

397
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I don't know if they are cooperating

398
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
They are also considering this

399
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Use administrative decrees instead of legislators to legislate

400
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Because of the administrative law, the words of the executive order

401
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
as long as

402
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,800
It won't be able to do it directly on the canvas

403
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,900
So at the beginning of the year

404
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,240
That is, the Council of Agriculture revises agricultural land and builds new farmhouses

405
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,300
farmhouse approach

406
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,700
The first one is to restrict farmers to build new

407
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,700
and buying and selling farmhouses

408
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,000
That is, you must be a farmer in your business

409
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,700
In case the farmhouse is improperly planted by intermediaries and consortiums

410
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:35,700
But when it comes to the Executive Yuan, it will be amended first.

411
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,200
first cut in half

412
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,100
The Executive Yuan has decided that the builders of farmhouses are limited to farmers

413
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,200
this is no problem

414
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,700
Because farming law is like this

415
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,900
But if the successor doesn't ask you, you will have to practice farming law

416
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,500
Because if you remember the farming method I talked about earlier,

417
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,600
It means that the recipient can be a natural person or an agricultural enterprise

418
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
So the Executive Yuan is

419
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
he theoretically stands still

420
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,500
He must go to the Legislative Yuan to amend the law

421
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,000
so this is no problem

422
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,500
So please ask this court to implement the first half first

423
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,000
Later, the Nonghua Regulations stipulate that Chen Xiuren must be above the agricultural level

424
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And property farming more than one year

425
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
However, there are agricultural health insurance, health insurance and the third category no longer hold cash

426
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
if you only talk about this

427
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Do not add the latter singular

428
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,500
I think it's a good policy

429
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,000
If you are in the Legislative Yuan, you can pass

430
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Probably solved more than half of the problem

431
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Why

432
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,500
look at everyone

433
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,000
What is the third category of insurance?

434
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Member of Farmers Association and Water Conservancy Association

435
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
He doesn't limit you to be a farmer

436
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
to join these members

437
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Also over 15 years old

438
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
A civic approach to agricultural implementation

439
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So this is a big loophole

440
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,500
The second is that you have to attend the ceremony

441
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Become a fake class member

442
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,760
Or over the age of 15 engaged in a job for 1 month

443
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,760
So you mean to say you join the farmers' meeting

444
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,760
You can become a farmer and buy agricultural insurance

445
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,260
This is to buy agricultural insurance and build a farmhouse

446
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,260
So this is a big farmer

447
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,760
There is another way you can become a farmer

448
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,760
That is, you go to participate in the farmer distribution class of the Council of Agriculture

449
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Two Issues You Are a Farmer

450
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,260
You can farmer loans

451
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,260
Then you can buy agricultural insurance

452
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,260
Then start to receive agricultural subsidies

453
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,260
so we all thought

454
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,260
This was formulated by the Council of Agriculture

455
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,260
This is actually just an amendment to an executive order.

456
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,260
should be no problem

457
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,260
But everyone, look at the Apple Daily on October 4

458
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,260
there is

459
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,260
usually executive order

460
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,260
Legislators have no power to review

461
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,260
this

462
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,740
The vice council organ politely sent it to the Legislative Yuan for future reference

463
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:10,540
But after this bill and this amendment are sent to the Legislative Yuan

464
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,840
There are 18 legislators including Chen Chaomin from Miaoli

465
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,040
These eighteen are all legislators of the Kuomintang

466
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,840
Everyone will go, most of them will go

467
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,240
Accompanying them at the press conference is National Real Estate

468
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,340
Chairman of the Council

469
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,840
They are against the Council of Agriculture

470
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:38,840
Sending this bill to the Legislative Yuan will change from reference to review

471
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,840
If you know

472
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,040
Once you're in the legislature and you're under scrutiny, that's bad.

473
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,840
the spirit of your original legislation

474
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,840
Probably all of them will be changed. It's a mess.

475
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,840
And among the 18 legislators

476
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,840
I promise you one or two may not be clear

477
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,340
What is the New Deal order? What is the legislation of the Legislative Yuan?

478
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I won't call names

479
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
But I want you to check the list

480
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You'll know these legislators just sign

481
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
just come on

482
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Therefore, the Council of Agriculture is worried that the case will be brought back to the review room

483
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I am also worried that in the face of the adversity of the law amendment

484
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So now our policy is stuck here

485
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
These six items are what we set out in this white paper

486
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It is about the structural problems that Taiwan’s agriculture is currently facing

487
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The first is that I have already explained

488
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It is the rapid production of environmental substances in the farmland

489
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I haven't talked about this yet

490
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
The production environment affected by the second long-term root pruning policy

491
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Then the Nongjin post is what I just talked about.

492
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Then these are unreasonable agricultural regulations

493
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
that this

494
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Council of Agriculture, if you spend more than 80% of your budget on subsidies

495
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,720
Of course you don't have money for anything else

496
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,880
So you can't blame the COA

497
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,920
Because almost all of his money is in the Legislative Council and he has to do it

498
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,520
Mended must do

499
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,920
So his budget is 100 billion since 80 billion is gone

500
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,480
So he only has 20 billion a year to take care of our agriculture in Taiwan

501
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,560
so there is no way

502
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So these five are actually more or less related to our agricultural policy

503
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
what is the solution

504
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
There are short-term and long-term short-term solutions

505
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I just said something

506
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
In fact, as long as you really implement the existing laws and regulations

507
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Let me give you an example of a farmhouse

508
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
certainly

509
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
In the original development regulations, it was the regulations on rural development

510
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Paragraph 3 of Article 3 and Article 18 also provide

511
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You are applying for farmhouse qualifications to be directly engaged in agricultural production

512
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Then it is limited to farmers who do not have their own farmhouses

513
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And other farmland must be used for agriculture

514
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Don't underestimate this executive

515
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You can implement this as long as you rely on administrative orders

516
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You execute well and I promise you the farmhouse problem is over.

517
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Why? You're the first to buy or sell

518
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
To apply for agricultural qualifications, you must directly engage in agricultural production

519
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So you just win a review and don't let those fake farmers cover it

520
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
That's what the Yilan County Government is going to do.

521
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
The result is to pass this bill again

522
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
In the past, there were a lot of this

523
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
The brokerage of Huangwu went to protest in front of Xianzheng Five

524
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
That is to say, it should not be strictly enforced

525
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
What is the qualification of farmers

526
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
But Yilan Constitutional Five is strictly enforced

527
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So he is going to build a farm now

528
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's less, that is to say, it's 20% slower

529
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
speak slowly

530
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So you just have to do your best

531
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You can probably do the first half of the policy

532
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Sale and purchase of farm cooperatives with closed farmland

533
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
The second part you can make living there very uncomfortable

534
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Because of your other 750 ping you built a house

535
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Other than that, you are here to do farming

536
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You can't tell me how many fruit trees I planted

537
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
or make some of that paper disaster

538
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
then you can

539
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,240
he regards agriculture as

540
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,840
This is not legal anymore

541
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,280
so two or three months ago

542
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,080
The vice chairman of the Council of Agriculture is in Yilan

543
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,680
There was a farmhouse that was talked about

544
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,080
He planted a few rows because of him

545
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,280
he has a farmhouse

546
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,280
his house is qualified

547
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,640
The size of the farmhouse does not exceed

548
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,240
One-tenth of that 750 ping

549
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,560
but the lane next to him

550
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,080
Plus those street trees planted

551
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,640
usually illegal

552
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:36,080
So if the Council of Agriculture or the county government

553
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,640
Strictly enforce

554
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,280
you go to practice every month

555
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,280
Remove his illegal things immediately

556
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,520
he must be living very uncomfortable

557
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,160
His villa is only a villa

558
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,120
his way is gone

559
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,760
His potted plant is gone too

560
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,640
His magnetic paper is gone

561
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
you make him very uncomfortable

562
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,480
Just you execute this

563
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,960
You can accept it as a farmhouse test

564
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Then it depends on our county mayor

565
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,960
Is there an exception to this

566
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
In fact, there should be a so-called long-term plan

567
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
long-term planning first

568
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
you want to go back to that mother law

569
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
You want to amend the Agricultural Development Regulations

570
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
You need to draw paper, current agricultural construction methods

571
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
because in every country in the world

572
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I think there is a so-called

573
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
how to say strategic thinking

574
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Let's say I want to feed my billion people

575
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
How much good farmland should I have at least

576
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I can feed these people

577
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Then I divide the farmland

578
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I said I will never allow you to buy or sell these farmlands

579
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
No, you are not allowed to develop it for industrial use

580
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
or other uses

581
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You have to have this kind of strategic thinking

582
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Then you must go back to our strictest one

583
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
go inside the law

584
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,460
Mainland China, don't watch it blossom randomly

585
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,960
it has some farmland you can never touch

586
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,460
it is strategic farmland thinking

587
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,260
it knows it has to feed a billion people

588
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,760
it must always have enough farmland

589
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,160
So it doesn't mess with

590
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,560
Although it is relatively marginal

591
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,160
that some farmland will be used

592
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,960
but it has a bottom line

593
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,260
We in Taiwan seem to have no bottom line

594
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,560
If you arrive in Yilan, you will be very sad

595
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,200
I just passed through Yilan for our self-speaking event last week

596
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,560
You will find that half of Yilan's farmland has been removed

597
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,560
There is a villa in the middle of most of the farmland

598
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,460
And then there's our rooting policy

599
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,060
In fact, the benefits of the root cultivation policy were good at the beginning.

600
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,400
you prune and turn

601
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,960
This solves two problems at the same time

602
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,060
Our rural labor is not enough

603
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,500
If the government has enough

604
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,560
You take that subsidy for root pruning money

605
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,520
half for farmers half for farmers

606
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,680
Give these young people who want to go to the countryside let him come to Monong

607
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,880
I think you can solve this rural labor problem

608
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,720
So if you make good use of the subsidy, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is completely wasted.

609
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,280
But if you just go and let him prune there

610
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,960
Then your money is really a complete waste

611
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,960
And this old farmer should have done it long ago

612
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,400
into our national pension system

613
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,360
You can't possibly have a provisional regulation that hasn't been changed in 31 years

614
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,720
I think this is something our government should think about

615
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,760
The Basic Law of Agriculture is actually to combine all these

616
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,400
The bill I discussed turned it into a full statute

617
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,120
That's where our country's agriculture is headed

618
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
this i think

619
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Because I have probably mentioned that it is the employment opportunity for agricultural talents in our country

620
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Then the next step is actually the policy issue we are facing in Taiwan now.

621
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You only need one or two exceptions to the head of government agency and exception to the mayor of the county

622
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Probably there will be many problems, and it should be possible to decide

623
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
But what we are really facing is this problem

624
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Our food independence in Taiwan is for food security

625
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You often hear about food security, but in fact it has a

626
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Let's say the UN's FAO in 1996

627
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It has formulated a definition of what is called food security

628
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
It simply means that when all people at all times have access to

629
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
and controlling sufficient quantities of high-quality food for an active and healthy life

630
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So now it's a matter of value and quantity

631
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,360
Enough and hopefully the entire population of the world

632
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:11,000
But now we are facing many challenges

633
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,600
The increase in population is also due to the need for quality

634
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,440
There is also an increase in agricultural production and a decrease in agricultural production.

635
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,480
The problem that the global environment becomes

636
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,080
That means we have to produce enough food

637
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,400
to feed the global population is a big challenge

638
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,400
Why, in fact, you look at food security

639
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,160
The most important thing is to look at the bones

640
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,640
Because bones are not just rice for eating

641
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,440
used as fodder

642
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,960
So bone is almost the vast majority of

643
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,560
source of calorie

644
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,720
So you have to see if the food supply is enough

645
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,000
Just look at the global bone production

646
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,600
This blue one is from the past few decades

647
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,840
The one with global bone production

648
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,800
increasing trend

649
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,400
That's actually a very

650
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,400
re-markable achievement

651
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,200
because you can see

652
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,800
it's straight up

653
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,200
from the green revolution

654
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,000
After the Green Revolution of 1960

655
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:10,800
Always

656
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:12,800
keep going

657
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,600
that

658
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,600
Straight up

659
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,500
if that means

660
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,100
We scientists are so good

661
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,500
can make this

662
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,600
The food production line

663
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,000
keep this

664
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:24,800
this

665
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,300
is equivalent to a linear increase.

666
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,500
we will face

667
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,600
In 2050 we will face

668
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,900
food crisis

669
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,700
because this is

670
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,100
demand

671
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,700
this is your surprise

672
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,000
you can see until 2050

673
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,700
This gap will be much

674
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,100
that is

675
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,000
if we don't solve this problem

676
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,800
in 2050 there will be

677
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,500
food

678
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,100
worldwide

679
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
food shortage problem

680
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,200
Once the problem of global food shortage

681
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,500
there will be war

682
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,500
there will be a bend

683
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,600
so this is a

684
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,200
very important question

685
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
What about us in Taiwan?

686
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,860
food security, let's look at food independence

687
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,960
Everyone, if you look at the big countries in the world

688
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,460
Its agriculture must be ranked among the top in the world

689
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,960
Except for Japan

690
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,360
Everyone, take a look at Huaguo's food independence

691
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,060
300%

692
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:21,060
so it is an agricultural exporting country

693
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,960
US 120%

694
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,460
Mainland China 70%

695
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,160
Taiwan 32%

696
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,460
So that means we need

697
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,460
70% of calorie is imported

698
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,460
Then maybe you think you can buy it

699
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,060
not so easy

700
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,760
Everyone knows

701
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,260
In addition to rice, these stocks in Taiwan

702
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,560
we can be autonomous

703
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,060
corn for feed

704
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,460
barley, wheat

705
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,960
Rely almost entirely on imports

706
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Then you may think that money is enough to buy

707
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
food is not that expensive

708
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
In 205 there was a look a few years ago

709
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
15 years ago there was a national

710
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
not the whole country

711
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
There are several large granaries in the world

712
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
because of the drought

713
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Mainland China India Russia

714
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
their country is in drought

715
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
US pulls corn for reproductive alcohol

716
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So that year there were several places in the world

717
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Its currency book is 4%

718
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
4% is 50%

719
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Because the corn sold in the United States

720
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
closely related to everyone

721
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Most of the meat you eat is American

722
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
grew up eating american corn

723
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
pig sheep chicken

724
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So that year Taiwan

725
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Almost put our so-called war food stockpile

726
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Every year our Taiwan government

727
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
will buy some rice

728
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
then save

729
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
after a few years

730
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Then remove the older rice

731
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And then when we need

732
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
The government can provide emergency

733
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,820
We almost put that

734
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,640
Our storage is all gone

735
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,480
Inflation in Taiwan did not exceed 10% in that year

736
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,280
Otherwise we will have a crisis that year

737
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,100
that so

738
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,720
This shows Taiwan's food insecurity

739
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,280
That

740
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,600
Rice everyone look

741
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,640
We are 100% self-sufficient

742
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,740
Then we need to import 6% because the WTO stipulates that we must import

743
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,020
but

744
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,340
Now Taiwan is also starting to face problems

745
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,420
It's just that I almost mentioned the farmland before.

746
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,460
We lost a lot of farmland

747
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,000
rural manpower

748
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,540
and water resources

749
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,060
this is all

750
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,100
the problem we are facing

751
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,140
but in fact

752
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,180
more serious

753
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,500
Even God is looking for trouble

754
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,320
everybody

755
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,380
It's like global warming

756
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,840
I don't know if it will have a direct impact on Taiwan.

757
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,760
Because summer doesn't seem to be hotter than before

758
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,440
Although we complain sometimes it's hot

759
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,440
But climate and environmental changes caused by global warming

760
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,080
Some have particularly strong influence on Taiwan

761
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:25,440
Average daytime temperature in Taiwan over the past 100 years

762
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,320
only increase a little

763
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,840
will not exceed the level of world increase

764
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,760
But our night temperature is the average temperature at night

765
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,880
just increase it twice

766
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,400
Don't underestimate these two times

767
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,320
The global average pool is only 0.7 degrees

768
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,280
Taiwan facility twice

769
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,000
There is the International Rice Organization and they have scientists doing experiments

770
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,800
If your temperature increases by one degree at night

771
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,720
Your rice yield will be super white

772
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,200
Because usually the role of daytime light

773
00:39:59,200 --> 00:39:59,920
night

774
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
colder weather

775
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,840
That means that the metabolism of plants will Slowdown

776
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,480
will be slower

777
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,040
So it consumes less energy

778
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,920
So it is equivalent to removing its energy at night

779
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,040
Then if your temperature is higher at night

780
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,120
Your metabolic rate will be higher

781
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,200
So your output will be lower then

782
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,120
this is the theory

783
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:25,440
But that is to say, it should be considered as full REASM

784
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,200
The climate change caused by global warming

785
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,320
It's not just the high temperature I'm talking about

786
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,240
Sometimes Draught

787
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,440
flooded

788
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,680
and extreme climate

789
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,000
That's all scientific proof

790
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,480
That is to say, there are many reports

791
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,480
The so-called extreme climate is

792
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,520
You may feel that

793
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,160
Although it is our average temperature

794
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,760
The temperature remains almost the same during the day

795
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,800
but you can feel

796
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,480
can it feel like

797
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,120
sometimes very cold days

798
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,320
a few more days

799
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,120
And sometimes it's very cold

800
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,380
Especially hot days will pop up suddenly like this

801
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,800
when it shouldn't be hot

802
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,140
it will pop up

803
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,500
So this is all documented

804
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,800
So although it is

805
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,040
That is to say, it doesn't look particularly serious.

806
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,880
But this is for agricultural aid countries

807
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,880
This effect is particularly large

808
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,740
the problem is

809
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,080
well if we admit

810
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,080
That is to say, now there is global warming and climate change

811
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,280
That's an upside-down for us in Taiwan

812
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,000
Does it actually affect

813
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,880
that this

814
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,880
i don't have an answer right now

815
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,720
But let's start by asking the question

816
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,720
Does it directly affect

817
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,160
that climate change

818
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,960
that is to say especially that

819
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,680
temperature change

820
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,160
resulting in two most important

821
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,660
The most important influence on inversions is

822
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,420
Disease species and its accelerated evolution

823
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,660
I'll give you this example later

824
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,160
Then it also affects

825
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
Your output and real volume

826
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,780
This is an experiment conducted by academician Liu Shaocheng of our middle school

827
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,700
Then Barton 9 is Taiwan, as I mentioned earlier.

828
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:13,640
is our average daily temperature over the past few decades

829
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,780
it doesn't change much

830
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:21,940
But its temperature difference between the sun and the moon decreases and the temperature annoyance increases

831
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,420
This is Academician Liu Shaocheng's Publication

832
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,840
If you have high temperature, what will be the impact on Taiwan's production

833
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,500
The first one, if you come in high temperature

834
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:45,500
It happens to be in the flowering period when the pattern is forming or the period when it is about to bear fruit

835
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,800
It will not be affected when the temperature is about 33 degrees

836
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,600
As far as Pollination is concerned, the output will be low

837
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,500
As I said earlier, if you increase the temperature rejection, the production will decrease by 10%.

838
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
encouraged from

839
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
That is, you take that, that is to say, you collect the gold

840
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
and then, right there

841
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Endo Spen is when refilling is encouraged

842
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
If the temperature is very high, there will be fishy white

843
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I'll show you one of those later

844
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
A photo, then this kind of white rice with fishy mist is the empty egg

845
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
eat no nutrition

846
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Then this is me from National Taiwan University

847
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
At that time, the agronomy department was the play director, Lu Hushen

848
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Now is the era borrowed by the director of the Science and Technology Department of the Agricultural Committee

849
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Well, we in Taiwan actually have something to do with the planting of waterways.

850
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Very good management, so every year the government announces

851
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Declare, review first, that is, you will

852
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
How many farmers have to plant how much, how much

853
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
the waterway of the work, and then he will estimate that is to say

854
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
What is the total output of this strain you are planting now?

855
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
So at the beginning of every year he

856
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
He would say that I estimate that Taiwan will

857
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
How much is rice production

858
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Then one year later there are actual numbers

859
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Usually the Internet was established 20 or 30 years ago

860
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Our government is very powerful

861
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
The predictions are very accurate

862
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
That is, your total output

863
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
The estimated output is about the same as your actual output

864
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Then this is for our management

865
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
our economy

866
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It's very important whether you want to buy rice or not

867
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
But look at the past few years

868
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
This is the data Mr. Lu Wusen has

869
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
In the past few years he has been on mission

870
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
almost ten percent

871
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Does it sound like what I said earlier?

872
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Because it means that the warming temperature of the previous autumn

873
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
It seems that there will be a direct correlation

874
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Well of course it's not evidence

875
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
but we're going to ask

876
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Is this the reason?

877
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Why our output is higher than our estimate

878
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
so much less

879
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
ten percent less

880
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
that's a lot

881
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
that's what i said

882
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,820
Encourage the enrichment period If your temperature is greater than 33 degrees

883
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,620
You will see this opaque

884
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,680
this opaque this

885
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,220
we call this

886
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,500
negative new white

887
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,540
Then this empty egg has no nutritional value.

888
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,600
because it encourages enrichment

889
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,400
That nutrient has not been deposited

890
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,740
So in Taiwan, you buy rice with that grade.

891
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,760
if you see

892
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,040
a lot of this

893
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:23,800
that

894
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:24,840
a lot of this

895
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,880
looks like

896
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,920
pure white opaque

897
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:29,960
don't buy that

898
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,000
that is the cheapest

899
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,920
that so

900
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,560
that is

901
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,980
if you

902
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,040
pre-autumn warming

903
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,840
will have the effect of these

904
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,280
the most important

905
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,280
seriously ill

906
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,440
accelerated evolution

907
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,080
so

908
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,840
even if it is silent

909
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
professor his age

910
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
He just suggested

911
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
we are technically

912
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
what to develop

913
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
The first is to have

914
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Breeding of softening two-fat rice

915
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
shadow technology

916
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
water mixed and oxygen mixed

917
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Regulated Cultivation Techniques

918
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Surveillance and Outbreak System Recommendations

919
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
This is more traditional

920
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
the field of agriculture

921
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So Chinese medicine hospital probably

922
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
research in this area

923
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
but this

924
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
With some of our Chinese medicine hospital

925
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
teacher of plants

926
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
there is some correlation

927
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Because our hospital

928
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
There are many teachers who make plants

929
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
The study of interaction with the environment

930
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
that so

931
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
so

932
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I am here

933
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Probably about five years ago

934
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
we formed a team

935
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
just want it

936
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Actually the most

937
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
to build

938
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
a platform

939
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,500
that is

940
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,500
We consider that we are Taiwan

941
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,000
how to quote this

942
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,500
Global Warning affects us everywhere

943
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Then its idea is that you want

944
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,500
Actually we're not the only ones thinking this way

945
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,000
In fact, the world told me

946
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Now there needs to be a

947
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,500
Second Green Revolution

948
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
and you

949
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,500
The first green revolution was when you just

950
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,500
that is

951
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,500
with a lot of feedback

952
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,500
Plenty of that sasom season

953
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,500
Then you just have enough output

954
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,500
that's good

955
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,500
But the new generation

956
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,500
The Second Green Revolution

957
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,500
Because our problems are different

958
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,500
Because the environment you face is not like before

959
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,500
Because you only need to overflow a seed before

960
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,500
because of your climate change

961
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,500
not so suddenly

962
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,500
So our idea is to say

963
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,500
we want to build a platform

964
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,500
It is equal to having a Swar Team

965
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
called the Rapid Strike Force

966
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,580
That cooperates with, for example, the person who makes the ring change

967
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,440
They probably can predict

968
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,840
In other words, how will the environment change in the next few years?

969
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,740
For example, Taiwan said that there will be drought in the future

970
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,840
there will be a drought

971
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,840
Or say there will be too many fish

972
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,340
Or in spring when it shouldn't be hot

973
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,640
it will be too hot

974
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,340
then we hope we have that ability

975
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:25,760
It's from our tour kids

976
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,040
inside the toolbox

977
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,440
reserve one

978
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,280
Can cope with the next three or four years

979
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,880
The crops of the new environment

980
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,480
That's because rice is the most important

981
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,980
So we use rice as our platform

982
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,680
just want to build a platform

983
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,480
equal to rapid strike force

984
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,580
That is, we need to be able to quickly preseed

985
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:52,480
you if we can predict the environment

986
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,380
What kind of environment do we need our rice to face

987
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:00,420
then we will pre-release this new platform

988
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
to grow in this environment

989
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
This is our idea

990
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
So what we're looking for should probably be

991
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
In our country, that is to say

992
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Make plants interact with the environment

993
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
quite accomplished

994
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
mostly from

995
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Academia Sinica

996
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Agro-life Center Zhiwei Institute

997
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
There is also a marriage office

998
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Then we also found the National Taiwan University Department of Agronomy

999
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
and Central Agronomy Department

1000
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
And some teachers from the farm

1001
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
We are mainly divided into three teams

1002
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
The first is to resist disease

1003
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
The second is heat resistant

1004
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
The third is to raise questions and use

1005
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
This is actually

1006
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
You want to develop permaculture

1007
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
will face this problem

1008
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So in total we have

1009
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
seven sub-plans

1010
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
the first is

1011
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
The first team and the second team

1012
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It's me and Mr. Wang Qiangsheng

1013
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
It is the Department of Agronomy of Central University

1014
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And Teacher Lin Dajun

1015
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
farm office

1016
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Let's

1017
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
to study Taiwan's waterways

1018
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,400
Osteobacterium albicans, pathogenic mechanism, and wedding papers

1019
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,960
I will talk about the details of the comparison experiment later.

1020
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,960
Then the team used by Lu Husheng and Changyi is anti-heat

1021
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,700
Then this, these four are the absorption of plant breeding

1022
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,460
The wedding paper mechanism used

1023
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,000
That's actually very important

1024
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:29,300
Because plants are the basic elements to maintain plant growth

1025
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,000
Including sunlight, water, air and minerals

1026
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,800
Water and sunlight, of course, sunlight is free

1027
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,400
but water water resources

1028
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,500
So we hope that the waterway we pre-existed

1029
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:48,100
In the future, you may not need to use so many neutrons

1030
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,100
especially mineral elements

1031
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,200
Like the egg spirit armor is the three most important we call marcoelement

1032
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,500
That is, plants need a lot of nutrients to grow well

1033
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,700
some of that is tiny

1034
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,840
So several of our teachers have made eggs zero

1035
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,840
There are also iron cores and copper ones

1036
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,940
Then you may think

1037
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,200
what's so great about your elements

1038
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,500
Seems like zeros are everywhere

1039
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:26,140
But in fact, zero is the most serious problem currently facing

1040
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:32,140
Because most of the zeros on Earth can't actually be absorbed by plants

1041
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:34,380
Only a part of the limited amount can

1042
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:38,280
We call it bioavailability, which is what plants can use

1043
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:43,980
Then these zeros are only available in a few countries

1044
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,680
So you want the current zero return

1045
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,580
That has already started means that it should be used up in a few decades

1046
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,880
So the plants you're going to grow now are

1047
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,120
You need to be able to use fewer zeros

1048
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,320
But still look good

1049
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,220
Well, this is actually a big trick

1050
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,220
easy to say

1051
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,400
but not so easy

1052
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,720
so

1053
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,620
Of course the egg is also very important

1054
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,620
But because suddenly there are fine grains in it that can solidify the egg

1055
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:12,460
So it should be relatively less deductible

1056
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,720
But this and these three

1057
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,000
That's what our comprehensive Nutrient team is doing

1058
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,600
So we are the most plant-based nutrition team

1059
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,260
Their most important thing is to improve the nutritional value of food

1060
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,020
and improve crop quality

1061
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,720
And reduce the nutrition of sweet food

1062
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,720
that this

1063
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,920
if you can achieve this

1064
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,320
you can help our environment

1065
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:40,500
call

1066
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,680
Because all the farmland now

1067
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,960
Whether in Taiwan or around the world

1068
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,960
are beginning to face the so-called prolongation problem

1069
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,180
because you use too much nutrition

1070
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,180
Most of them are silent in the soil.

1071
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,020
that of your soil

1072
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:58,180
If there are many of these Nutrient

1073
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,140
its continuation will

1074
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,260
relative increase

1075
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,900
so you lose too many times

1076
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,100
Your farmland will not be usable after a long time

1077
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,500
So this can achieve several goals in one fell swoop

1078
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,700
The rest of the time I'll talk about my own experiments

1079
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,400
Because Zhongyan always has to do experiments.

1080
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,500
I spoke a lot of formal questions today

1081
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,500
It's not good if you don't talk about some of your own research results.

1082
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
so

1083
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
So right at the beginning of our project

1084
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,600
I was with Mr. Wang Qiangsheng from Chung Hsing University

1085
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,000
we will team up

1086
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
we decided to solve

1087
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
The so-called disease of Taiwan's waterways

1088
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,500
There are three major diseases in waterways

1089
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,500
The first one is called white leaf mushroom disease

1090
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,000
It was caused by a Seo Joon

1091
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
The other one is called stealing fever

1092
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
that was made by a

1093
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
caused by a fungus

1094
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,760
The other Wengu disease is also caused by fungi

1095
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:15,000
Both bacterial blight and rice fever can be killed by good chemical pesticides

1096
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,000
Everyone, have you seen the Mystery Fever?

1097
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,840
Kun Bingbei once killed in a field and passed out

1098
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,720
He just wants to pre-spray

1099
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,480
Because he just wants to kill pesticides and kill white leaf mushroom bacteria

1100
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,480
So what I mean by this is that he can kill but is very poisonous

1101
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,480
It's not good for the land, it's not good for people

1102
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,480
Usually this white leaf mushroom disease breaks out after typhoon

1103
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,480
Because after the typhoon, everyone will be injured

1104
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,480
Once the leaves are injured, it is easier for bacteria to enter

1105
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,480
So you often see that fever break out for no reason

1106
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,480
Usually there are some natural disasters

1107
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,600
this disease

1108
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,740
In fact, rice is being made all over the world

1109
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:14,600
But we in Taiwan must do rice research by ourselves

1110
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,300
there is a reason

1111
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,960
Because there are two main species of rice cultivated

1112
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,560
North of the Yangtze River is called Japónica

1113
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,500
It is the bee rai rice that you like to eat

1114
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,300
The south of the Yangtze River is called Indica

1115
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,300
Your name is Zelami

1116
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,300
Taiwan is the only southern country

1117
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,000
bee rai rice

1118
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
種 Japanese

1119
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Because the Japanese introduced it to the Bamboo Lake in Yangmingshan and began to plant it.

1120
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,200
Slowly let it loop down to level ground

1121
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,700
After decades of breeding

1122
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,300
Our Taiwan is now the only one in the world

1123
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,500
south country eat

1124
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,100
以Japanese

1125
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,680
When our main rice is our door

1126
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,880
There are pros and cons to this

1127
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,200
Because at least I personally prefer to eat red rice

1128
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,680
And it's not very tasty in Leme

1129
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:22,200
Because this is usually the pathogenic bacteria and its season family

1130
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,880
There is that special relationship we call a bend-to-bend relationship

1131
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,200
That is to say, a certain physiological swelling

1132
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,600
Strains that usually have some waterways

1133
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,400
It will fight against this physiological small swelling

1134
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,760
it will have disease resistance genes

1135
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,680
So there is that correspondence

1136
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:41,560
So it is very important for you to know what this physiological edema is

1137
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,000
Then there is a unit under the United Nations in the Philippines called

1138
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,960
International Water Course Research Center

1139
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,920
They specialize in Lemi our name is Indica

1140
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:54,120
Then they have 21 standard strains

1141
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,760
each with a fungus resistant to white leaf mushroom

1142
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,960
Gene, that is to say, the waterway has that

1143
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Then if you go to Asian countries to collect his white patriotic disease bacteria

1144
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
You'll find 21 strains of white patriotism

1145
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Exactly almost 1 to 1

1146
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
That is to say, if you carry this disease-resistant bacteria

1147
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
You can resist physiological swelling 1 to 1

1148
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
That's irresistible to others

1149
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
So this is an example

1150
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
You can see us talking about this

1151
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
This one has this antibacterial

1152
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Then you see he is not resistant to this white patriotic germ

1153
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
He only fights one or two

1154
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Then these two will be

1155
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
That is to say, he has similar healing bacteria

1156
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
So you have this disease-resistant bacteria

1157
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
you'll deal with this and this

1158
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
but not resistant to other diseases

1159
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
So you must know the physiological small swelling

1160
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Only then will you be able to predict the disease-resistant water to

1161
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Then why does Taiwan have to do it by itself?

1162
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,240
Then I will give you the reason why Taiwan must do it by itself

1163
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,400
that's us

1164
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,680
Just say when I come back

1165
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,600
That is

1166
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,960
on behalf of the farm

1167
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,320
The existing Baiyugu bacteria in Taiwan

1168
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,280
Find the so-called wedding paper label

1169
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,360
help him

1170
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,600
It's like helping him create that ID card.

1171
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,920
There are about five major species in Taiwan

1172
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,880
That's probably distributed in

1173
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,000
distributed in these places

1174
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,200
Then this is our 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 like this

1175
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,200
You can watch

1176
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,200
should be

1177
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,200
this top

1178
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,800
And here's the frequency he distributed

1179
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,200
That's really hard work

1180
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,200
because

1181
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,960
Taiwan before almost 1990

1182
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,120
the collection of races

1183
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:45,920
very complete

1184
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,320
we collect every year

1185
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,560
Our farming units are located all over the province

1186
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,280
collect back

1187
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,040
Then come back and put it in that freezer

1188
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,720
Then you'll study its physiological properties in the future

1189
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,120
you can take it out

1190
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,960
But look at this picture

1191
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,500
Between 1990 and 2010

1192
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:05,280
it collects infrequently

1193
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,980
Especially in the past ten years, almost completely broken

1194
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:16,980
So we took out all the things hidden in the freezer by the farm

1195
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,440
Then compare it with what they collected back then

1196
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,480
As a result, in fact, Taiwan used to

1197
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:32,480
So there should be no new strains in the past 20 years

1198
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,480
Just these four

1199
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,480
One of them is called one and one be

1200
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,480
so it's still

1201
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,480
That means you haven't had a new one in the past 20 years

1202
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,480
But if you do the independent trust test

1203
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:52,480
Because we put these collected 20 years ago in the freezer

1204
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,480
frozen firm take it out

1205
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,480
can activate it

1206
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,480
and ask how poisonous it is

1207
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,480
Then put the newcomer

1208
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,760
This is the same species, the same biological race, so let's ask how poisonous it is

1209
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:14,240
The answer is that Gang Xincai's toxicity is stronger than that of his relatives twenty years ago

1210
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:18,760
That is to say, as time changes, his toxicity will increase

1211
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,160
So he is not there obediently, his toxicity is getting stronger and stronger

1212
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:29,600
That's what it means. If you want to predict your own in Taiwan, you must follow the evolution of the continuation.

1213
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:34,680
You need to pre-produce new varieties that can resist these white frontal bone disease bacteria over time

1214
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,680
Then why can't we rely on others

1215
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:44,440
Then we have the so-called high-throughput sequencing

1216
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,120
So you can easily fix the exhausted early hardware

1217
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,920
Then let's take Taiwan, both of which belong to Taiwan

1218
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,880
This is the most toxic, this is not so strong

1219
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:00,040
Then if I draw a line here, it means his chromosome series here

1220
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
a little different

1221
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
You can see this one in Taiwan is very similar

1222
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
no difference

1223
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
give you a test

1224
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Hui Libing is closer to Taiwan

1225
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Then we also decided to continue

1226
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
icy gray

1227
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Then Japanese and Korean bacteria

1228
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Someone has already ordered

1229
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
let's compare it

1230
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
You guys think it's relatively close

1231
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Huili Bing's Baiyan Mushroom Bing's Mushroom

1232
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
It is more similar to the bacteria in Taiwan

1233
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Or Japanese and Korean

1234
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
You guys are amazing

1235
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Although Japan and South Korea are farther away than us

1236
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
it is as it may be

1237
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Because you have already said

1238
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
The rice season group followed it with bacteria

1239
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
are co-evolved

1240
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
So it still has its characteristics

1241
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
but there is a short book

1242
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
This is from Taiwan

1243
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
this is korean

1244
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
this japanese

1245
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
It's icy gray

1246
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
If I have this kind of

1247
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
like crossed lines

1248
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
just say

1249
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
it has major changes

1250
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
the location of that gene

1251
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
In other words, genetically, it is actually a relatively large change.

1252
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Variability is relatively large

1253
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
So the more you have this cross

1254
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
means it is more different

1255
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
so you look at japan

1256
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Korea is different from us

1257
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
mostly straight

1258
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
But you see in the Philippines

1259
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
look

1260
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
but

1261
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
if you look carefully

1262
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
these crossed

1263
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
In fact, the most important gene

1264
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
These genes are all genes that cause white face bone disease

1265
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
that is

1266
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Our Taiwan albino bone disease bacteria

1267
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Although similar to Japan

1268
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
but it has evolved a unique set of disease-causing genes

1269
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
so you have its unique disease-causing gene

1270
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
you need to be unique

1271
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Rice resistant to this disease-causing gene

1272
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
so

1273
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Only Taiwan has this bacteria in the world

1274
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
so you have to do it yourself

1275
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
what others do is useless

1276
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
So why do we have to make our own rice

1277
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
that's why

1278
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Will do it for us, what others do is useless

1279
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Everyone probably agrees that today is not my topic

1280
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,500
Maybe next time Wang Mu will invite me again

1281
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,500
Besides, genetically modified crops are very safe

1282
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,000
But you all have this

1283
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
there may be some problems

1284
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
but there is another way

1285
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
You can actually pre-sum

1286
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,500
And soon, it's called pre-marriage papers

1287
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,500
Professor Wang Qiangsheng at the Agricultural Institute

1288
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,500
image library

1289
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,500
That is to use Tainong No. 67

1290
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:37,500
Tai Nong No. 67 Everyone must know him

1291
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,500
Because the basmati rice you eat

1292
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,500
What is the number of Geng, what is the number of Kaohsiung?

1293
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:44,500
All are from Tainong No. 67

1294
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,500
his descendants

1295
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,500
Because Tainong 67 has a large output

1296
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,500
He resists many environmental adversities

1297
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,500
he looks good

1298
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:53,500
Then he is also resistant to these bacteria

1299
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,500
some neutral resistance

1300
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,500
So he is the general manager of Taiwan

1301
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,500
the most important one

1302
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,000
So Professor Wang Qiangqiang used

1303
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
We created a set called mutation library

1304
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
That mutant library is yours

1305
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
inside his descendants

1306
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
There will be many new features

1307
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Then Mr. Wang started to plug

1308
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Then he stuffed some

1309
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Look at this ability to heal

1310
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
then he takes this

1311
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I just told you about the XF89

1312
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
That's the most poisonous bacteria

1313
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Then he goes to try these and that mutant library

1314
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
he finds out

1315
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
This is the earliest rice in Taiwan called Tainong No. 1

1316
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Then this is Tainong No. 67

1317
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
That's the size he's really sick

1318
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Then you can see that Tainong-1 is almost immune to resistance

1319
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Tainong No. 1 is almost irresistible

1320
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Tainong No. 67 still has a considerable degree of resistance

1321
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
But Teacher Wang found a few

1322
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
It is the descendant of Tainong No. 67

1323
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Then the following is the data in front of him

1324
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
You can see this is Tainong 1

1325
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Natai Nong No. 67

1326
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And this is stuffed by Mr. Wang

1327
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
you can see most of his

1328
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
This is how we measure his ability to heal

1329
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Then you can see Mr. Wang's rice

1330
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
The new strain is very good

1331
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Then I can introduce by the way

1332
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
You probably don't know us

1333
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
the name of the crop field grown

1334
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Everyone, if you hear Tainong

1335
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Whether it's ripe bananas or anything

1336
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
just call tainong

1337
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
It's all from our farming area

1338
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Then if you hear Kaohsiung

1339
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
What is the number in Kaohsiung

1340
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
That's from the Kaohsiung Improvement Factory.

1341
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Then each of our counties and cities has an improvement plant

1342
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
But only those under the Council of Agriculture

1343
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
have a flagship research unit

1344
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Agricultural Laboratory

1345
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
So everyone, as long as you hear Tainong

1346
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Probably they came out of the domain

1347
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Their contribution to Taiwan's agriculture

1348
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It's very big, everyone can do it, almost all vegetables and fruits have Tainong

1349
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Everyone can, you should not be able to imagine

1350
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
The Yuquan fragrant pear you like to eat is called Tainong No. 71

1351
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Probably in the year after next, there will be Tainong No. 77 in the next few years

1352
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Even more fragrant than Tainong No. 71, not very easy to grow

1353
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Because if it is fragrant, it is easy to attract sparrows

1354
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:32,000
So, once Mr. Wang finds this

1355
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:38,000
This Tainong No. 67 that can resist the white ear bone disease bacteria in Taiwan

1356
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
That's because Tainong No. 67 is still not as delicious as Tainong No. 71

1357
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
So it's now going to be called a backcross

1358
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
In the case of backcrossing, it probably means that you want to pass it back from generation to generation.

1359
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Then Teacher Wang started in 2014, so you are now in 2015

1360
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
That is to say, what you mean by crossing back is to say

1361
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Rice, for example, has about 25,000 genes

1362
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
that only

1363
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,160
A small segment is the gene to resist leukemia

1364
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,120
So if you teach Islam once, you will

1365
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:09,800
For example, I like Tainong No. 71 now

1366
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,160
But I need the small piece of disease-resistant gene of Tainong 67

1367
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:17,960
As soon as I teach, I will select the part of the gene that is resistant to the disease

1368
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:23,160
That means I'll get about 75% once I crossbreed.

1369
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:27,160
It is probably possible to stay on Tainong No. 71

1370
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,600
Only 25% are Tainong No. 67

1371
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,400
But it's not real, isn't it fragrant rice?

1372
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,000
so you continue to muslim

1373
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,400
After a generation, it will reach about 95%

1374
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,000
That's almost like turning into a basmati rice

1375
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,400
You will be Muslim about five times later

1376
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:47,600
You will change from Tainong 67 to Tainong 71

1377
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:52,800
So it has been certified by the Council of Agriculture, that is to say

1378
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:57,600
The Tainong No. 71 that Mr. Wang taught in Islam

1379
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,160
and a new strain

1380
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,800
Available in about two years

1381
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,100
It's modified from a gray machine for anti-white frontal disease

1382
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:07,160
Fragrant rice overflowing with wedding paper imperial seeds

1383
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:09,480
Then he is doing number 77 now

1384
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:11,260
So this is a

1385
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,320
Works on very TDS

1386
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,840
Because you can't spend money on this kind of paper

1387
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,120
and to

1388
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,400
you see everyone

1389
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:18,680
Muslim once a year

1390
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,480
So it takes four to five years of hard work

1391
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,280
But here comes the fragrant rice

1392
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:23,560
And without pesticides

1393
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,620
but as i said before

1394
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,700
you have this

1395
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,300
Bacteria

1396
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,600
Bacteria will follow and evolve

1397
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,420
Mr. Wang is now predicting this channel

1398
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,240
If you don't help this channel

1399
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:41,780
Anti-bacteria

1400
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:42,800
maybe five years from now

1401
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:44,600
you have to do it again

1402
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:45,360
Filter again

1403
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:46,640
so

1404
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,440
The other half is my home

1405
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:49,720
looking for

1406
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,500
to replace

1407
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,040
Pesticides used by Kun Beibei

1408
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,580
how do we find

1409
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,140
now is

1410
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,160
In fact, in the soil

1411
01:08:58,420 --> 01:08:59,440
There are also many microorganisms

1412
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,200
They compete with each other in Vitality

1413
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,680
So he often stunned and produced some compounds to kill other Seo Joon

1414
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,200
because he wants to compete he is in full circle

1415
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:16,200
So a lot of Tulang's vitamins have coma compounds

1416
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,600
Can be used as a biological machine

1417
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,080
Because he exists in nature

1418
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,200
He can use it to kill other Seo Joon

1419
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,880
So it was actually very difficult to find this kind of thing before.

1420
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,000
Often in five or ten years you still can’t find out what you saw

1421
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:34,040
That's because the so-called genomics still has a lot of progress

1422
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,800
I'm talking to you now about a postgraduate student working for less than two years

1423
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:38,920
then we will find

1424
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,400
It's not that hard to find this way.

1425
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:47,960
That's when you smeared white leaf mushroom germs all over

1426
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,680
inside this incubator

1427
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,440
Then you dig a hole in the middle

1428
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,760
Then you take that Seo Joon you want to try

1429
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,000
Let's see if he has the ability to kill white leaf mushroom disease

1430
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
the middle of the hole

1431
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:03,000
If he can kill Baiyan Bone Disease

1432
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
He'll melt the white bone disease bacteria

1433
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
He will come out in circles

1434
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
then this is

1435
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Circle it, everyone, look at this

1436
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Because he took pictures, this is the circle

1437
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Then you if this bacteria

1438
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
he doesn't have that ability

1439
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Said that he himself cannot be degraded

1440
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Can't kill white face bone disease

1441
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
So this is the German style of what we call quick people

1442
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Now the problem is

1443
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
you are going to find

1444
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
what compound

1445
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Because you can't just say I'm an orderly

1446
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Then my student

1447
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
designed a set

1448
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
That is

1449
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
first step

1450
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
just put this

1451
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
this bacteria

1452
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
He has the drug that kills the white bone disease

1453
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
He gave his whole order

1454
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
This bacterium is

1455
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
A teacher from Tamkang University, Wang Shanli

1456
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
He got out of the muddy mud of the Danshui River

1457
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
stuffed out

1458
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
he originally wanted

1459
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
When he raised this bacteria

1460
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
It is to

1461
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
with shrimp shells

1462
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,840
When the only source of nutrients

1463
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:09,040
He actually wanted to dissociate the lower shell.

1464
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,340
Experiment to decontaminate Oh Han Jin

1465
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:14,140
But hear it's a treasure

1466
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,440
Because after my students tried

1467
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,340
I found out that he has a lot of genes

1468
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:21,040
It seems that some secondary metabolites can be produced

1469
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,340
It can be used for sterilization

1470
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:34,080
So if you're looking for this compound early on,

1471
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,680
If you use the traditional method, it will be very painful

1472
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:39,080
Especially people in our lab like to make wedding paper creatures

1473
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,380
don't like chemistry

1474
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,080
So you're going to the wedding to identify the structure.

1475
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,080
That's a student in my lab

1476
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,780
definitely won't do it

1477
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:50,980
but with genetics you can do

1478
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:52,840
Because we now know the sequence

1479
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,640
about 1000 genes

1480
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,740
Then we have a technology that puts

1481
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:00,040
What we call a carrier can

1482
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,600
It's your turn to insert it into the gene at will

1483
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,440
Then if you insert it into the gene

1484
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:11,200
Genes cannot make normal proteins

1485
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,600
It looks like this...

1486
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,100
If you insert the key gene

1487
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:17,700
For example, I can kill albino frontal bacterium now

1488
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,400
Then you would generate this

1489
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,100
Then if you...

1490
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:24,400
this is you if that...

1491
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,600
If our gene is inserted into this gene called CLP

1492
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
just look at it...

1493
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Its ability to integrate is not enough

1494
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,600
Then you insert these two genes

1495
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,200
the one of it won't blend in at all

1496
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:39,100
So this one gives us a...

1497
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,300
a clue

1498
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:45,100
That is to say, the one that can kill the albino frontal bacterium...

1499
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:46,600
compound of

1500
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,400
maybe it has something to do with this

1501
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,100
That...

1502
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:54,000
My student he is very good

1503
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,500
Because at that time we had just killed a man from the United States

1504
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,000
UC San Diego Wedding School Back

1505
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,640
it is a support instrument

1506
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,640
video support

1507
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:07,000
I think the technology of video support device is actually very simple

1508
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,200
It's you who put Seo Joon here

1509
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,480
Then Seo Joon will secrete

1510
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,480
Then you shoot the laser up

1511
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,480
That instrument is your laser

1512
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:20,480
break down your compound into smaller molecules

1513
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,980
Then you can analyze its molecular weight

1514
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:25,480
then use various compounds

1515
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,980
then you can figure it out

1516
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:30,480
That is to say, it is inside the circle

1517
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,820
how many compounds

1518
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:34,580
What is the molecular weight of its compound

1519
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:37,580
Then you have this precise molecular weight

1520
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:41,660
You can go back and find out what kind of nucleic acid it is

1521
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,420
Then I told you again

1522
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,020
I have these mutants

1523
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:47,660
it doesn't make these compounds

1524
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:50,260
So you compare what we say

1525
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:51,660
WireTimes and these mutants

1526
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,460
you'll know soon

1527
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:57,140
What the hell is that nucleic acid?

1528
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:59,140
can kill bone disease

1529
01:13:59,140 --> 01:13:59,940
That's because

1530
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,240
In terms of time, I will jump over quickly

1531
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,040
That is to say, my students are usually ordinary people

1532
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:09,640
About ten years, I think, about ten years of your skills

1533
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,200
probably can make what he's doing now

1534
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:15,000
Then he said less than two years

1535
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
He found this compound

1536
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,080
It is the fungus next to the Danshui River I just mentioned.

1537
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,880
he can stun this compound

1538
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:24,880
he will spend silver light

1539
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,640
He can kill the white leaf mushroom ice fungus

1540
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,840
it's a product of nature

1541
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,280
And he produced a lot

1542
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,400
so he now we have

1543
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:39,400
We have Teacher Wang Qiangsheng

1544
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:43,880
The anti-bacteria of the white leaf mushroom ice of Mr. Wang Qiangsheng

1545
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,600
plus our compound

1546
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:50,040
So my student ran to the Beiguo Farm of Chung Hsing University

1547
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,480
do field experiments

1548
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,800
The field test is to use Honglaimi Tainong No. 6

1549
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,200
Taichung No. 9 and Taichung First No. 10

1550
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,960
Then you can see that this is

1551
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:07,000
It is the strength and weakness of the disease I showed you earlier.

1552
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Then this is if you have been on Tainong No. 67, you can see that this is for curing diseases

1553
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Then you just need to spread the righteousness of our handsome

1554
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
It is more resistant to disease

1555
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:27,000
So whether it is Tainong No. 67, Taycan No. 9, or Taichung Line to No. 10, it can be used

1556
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
So we have this

1557
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Now we are talking with Xinnong to discuss whether it is how we want to mass produce

1558
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Then with this creature, plus teacher Wang Qiangsheng’s anti-Baiyuegu disease waterway

1559
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I think we have solved the problem of white moon solid disease in Taiwan in the next 10 or 20 years

1560
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:55,000
You don't need pesticides, just plant the anti-white moon disease water channel of Mr. Wang Qiangsheng

1561
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Then at the right time, especially after Taiwan, you spread our Shangqing justice

1562
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,560
Probably no need for pesticides

1563
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,440
So this probably isn't

1564
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,440
that is

1565
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:12,360
If it is to say that the direction of our research in the early stage of the Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine

1566
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,280
we probably wouldn't do this kind of question

1567
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,600
But because we are called agricultural biotechnology

1568
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,760
if you go to that sky

1569
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,160
you will find that there are many problems

1570
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:24,760
In fact, you can pay equal attention to applied and basic science

1571
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,440
This is a good example

1572
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,720
The researchers at the Chinese hospital are not capable of doing all of them.

1573
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,160
You see our team actually has a neutral university

1574
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,320
National Taiwan University, especially the department of agronomy

1575
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,720
There is also a farm

1576
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,520
Not only did we do this

1577
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,680
This is just one of our seven sub-plans

1578
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,480
The existing achievements of the two sub-projects

1579
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,920
Teacher Qiu Zizhen's team

1580
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,320
And teacher Cai Yifang's team

1581
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:54,720
They actually found the same picture library inside

1582
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,720
find something called i cant call it a picture gallery

1583
01:16:58,720 --> 01:16:59,880
new strain

1584
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,120
You give him very little respite and he very little fade

1585
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,400
He looks just like you, give him a lot of flashbacks, a lot of flashbacks

1586
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,360
exactly as good

1587
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,360
So now they're working on

1588
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:17,040
why did you give him so little fading

1589
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,320
he can look just as good

1590
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,720
This is actually a very difficult problem

1591
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:24,120
But Teacher Qiu Zizhen and Teacher Cai Yifang are probably world-class

1592
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:29,040
two of the best scientists in plant nutrition

1593
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,000
so i want to give them a few more years

1594
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,760
It should be possible not only to say that it is practical

1595
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,120
can go to the fields

1596
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,440
It is also possible to understand the molecular mechanism

1597
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:41,680
So to say I think I'm on this team I think we

1598
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:44,680
We can't say we've reached it

1599
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:47,440
In other words, I think our original idea

1600
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,960
is to build a platform

1601
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,880
so we can have a quick

1602
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:55,120
that has the ability to quickly produce new strains

1603
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:59,120
So I gave a speech at the Council of Agriculture last month

1604
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,080
Speaking of Agricultural Economics

1605
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,000
is how you bring technology into this molecular domain

1606
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,500
Then there is an expert from Japan

1607
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:14,000
He said their plan now is to have vegetables or rice

1608
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,500
They estimate if they have a letter of need to develop

1609
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,500
They do it about every three years

1610
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:23,500
The Mutual Aid Committee of the Council of Agriculture said whether we have the ability to do it

1611
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,000
i think we have

1612
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
but one thing is important

1613
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:33,000
You need what's called a gene bank

1614
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Because of the resistance I just mentioned

1615
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,500
In fact, there are more or less in nature

1616
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:41,000
So why do you ask why biology makes sex important

1617
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
It's that you have to keep the genetic pool of these resistances in the gene pool

1618
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,500
then when you need

1619
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:51,000
You can go to the resistance genes that are already there in nature

1620
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
You just smash it with the method of molecular domain

1621
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
to what you need

1622
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
so why do we do

1623
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Although we are doing so-called biotechnology

1624
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,120
You still have to support the so-called Bio-Diversity

1625
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,160
Because this is direction interlocking

1626
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,320
you must have gene pool

1627
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,200
The gene bank is Bio-Diversity

1628
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,600
Use the mutant gene pool with you

1629
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,360
So why can we be so successful now

1630
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,200
Because the farm has established a very good

1631
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:23,720
That mutant library is over there

1632
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:26,440
And the waterway has a lot of natural ones

1633
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,160
That mutant walks over there

1634
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:31,360
So the channel is very thick

1635
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,400
Should be pretty easy now

1636
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:34,440
Can be used as wedding paper

1637
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,760
Most of that resistance has

1638
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:37,560
That

1639
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,680
So I guess it's almost time

1640
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,880
then i think

1641
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:50,240
I listened to Shen Zheng Yuyan City last month

1642
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,920
his that

1643
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,520
There is a last era

1644
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,320
i think i'm going to steal it and use it

1645
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,080
He said Taiwanese people are not afraid

1646
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,000
say because of you

1647
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
you have a difficult problem

1648
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,000
you think you can't solve

1649
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
He means you just need to put your mind to it

1650
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
With the waywardness of us Taiwanese, we must do it

1651
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Although I have told you so much before

1652
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
our policy issues

1653
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Easy policy seems to be messed up

1654
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
a series of that is

1655
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
It is the evil law I mentioned earlier.

1656
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
But in fact those evil laws

1657
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
The benefits of deferment aren't that bad

1658
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
that now is to

1659
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
if we find a way

1660
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
be able to put these policies

1661
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
change it up a bit

1662
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Let us plan the sustainable development of Taiwan's agriculture

1663
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Average person goals and execution strategies

1664
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Then this must be driven by the government

1665
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
because without the government

1666
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
you are really

1667
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
you with the power of the people

1668
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
absolutely impossible

1669
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
There must be a good government

1670
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
The second is the participation of the people

1671
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,500
The people are us, you and me

1672
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:07,500
I think many people have seen this question more or less in the newspapers.

1673
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:16,000
Like last month, some people protested against the constitutional government in Yilan

1674
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,500
Several teachers from Yilan University started to organize

1675
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:24,000
Hold forums and give speeches in various places in Yilan

1676
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:31,500
If you can’t have only one voice in Taiwanese society

1677
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:36,000
Everyone should be able to organize

1678
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Let the public know your ideas

1679
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I think this is the responsibility of us scholars in traditional Chinese medicine hospitals and everyone else.

1680
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
That is, you have to participate in this kind of social

1681
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,500
In fact, it cannot be called a problem that society is closely related to us.

1682
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:59,500
Then why do I say Taiwanese

1683
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,120
You are not afraid, because in fact our agricultural technology in Taiwan

1684
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:06,420
World class at least so far

1685
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,420
It's just that we didn't integrate it

1686
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:10,420
Everyone, if you look at the pumpkin industry

1687
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:12,360
know we didn't rely on

1688
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,420
In fact, we grow pumpkins

1689
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:16,380
And what about the pumpkin production line?

1690
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:17,880
rarely rely on the government

1691
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:22,020
It's all our small farmers and some

1692
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:25,300
that pumpkin lover

1693
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:28,380
I have to build it up slowly by myself to get to the current scale.

1694
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,260
Taiwan is now exporting Butterfly South for one year

1695
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:31,760
About four billion Taiwan dollars

1696
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:36,660
That feeds a lot of people

1697
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:39,060
And it won't happen suddenly

1698
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,220
what they did

1699
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:46,420
Although some will be brought to the mainland by Taiwanese businessmen

1700
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:47,020
also hard to go

1701
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:50,520
But some skills cannot be learned

1702
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:53,960
Because like the pumpkin now that link

1703
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,160
by tissue culture

1704
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:59,000
Taiwan's organization training is

1705
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
nothing happened in doing

1706
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
not what you hire college students for

1707
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
it is a production line

1708
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
rarely infected

1709
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
big german family

1710
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
multinational

1711
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
go to vietnam to do

1712
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
He also wants to follow the example of Taiwan

1713
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
he built a big

1714
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
tissue cultured

1715
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
he closed after three years

1716
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
because he can't

1717
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
There is no way for the value of other functions

1718
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
In fact, tissue culture

1719
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
hard to say

1720
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
It's not easy to say

1721
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
But the one in Taiwan

1722
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Farmers also do these

1723
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Agricultural Values

1724
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
He just has his unique place

1725
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
like our hurricane grapes

1726
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Everyone can know

1727
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
The ones grown in Taiwan are all good

1728
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
And now grapes

1729
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
all year round, right?

1730
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Grapes are actually seasonal.

1731
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
That's because our farmers in Taiwan

1732
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
know when

1733
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
with appropriate feedback

1734
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
You can adjust

1735
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
make it bloom

1736
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
that technology

1737
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
already arrived

1738
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Because they come to Taiwan to study

1739
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
But they still can't make as good grapes

1740
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Because of the problem of pests and diseases

1741
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
There is no country in the world where farmers

1742
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Have the patience to bag

1743
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Guys, did you see that bag

1744
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
he is a worker

1745
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
If you ask mainland farmers to do it, they won’t do it

1746
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
So why can we reduce pesticides

1747
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
make fruit that can be so beautiful

1748
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
because we farmers

1749
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
He not only has this technique

1750
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
There is still this patience that can be done

1751
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
So our

1752
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Even though the day before yesterday on the front line

1753
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
And to our research on agricultural technology

1754
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
We actually have a good chance

1755
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Now that's when we take advantage of it

1756
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Then let us Taiwan's agriculture

1757
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
sustainable development

1758
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
ok i think i will stop here

1759
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Thanks

1760
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
and i want to thank my team

1761
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
It's definitely not my job alone

1762
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Thanks also to our Academia Sinica

1763
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,440
Fellow Science Center support

1764
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,440
There is also the Council of Agriculture and their investigation of the Agricultural Experimental Institute

1765
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,600
They are really very generous to us

1766
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,400
Whatever we use they are absolutely unconditionally fair

1767
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,840
so it's very good

1768
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,800
I think it is a good platform

1769
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,160
because the whole is a joke

1770
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,480
And the cooperation with Kua Unit

1771
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,240
Okay, thank you

1772
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,120
Thank you Director Shi

1773
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,840
Very macro and micro

1774
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,960
sounds very exciting

1775
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,760
If you can't do it anymore, do you have any questions to ask him?

1776
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:36,760
Come

1777
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,480
middle button

1778
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:54,680
Thank you very much Mr. Shi for your wonderful speech

1779
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,800
We also learned a lot here

1780
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,120
In the Prime Minister's speech just now

1781
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,120
I probably have three

1782
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:06,440
As I said, the sustainable development of Taiwan is closely related to the loss of high-quality translations

1783
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:10,120
The second zero profit and weakness of high-quality agricultural policy

1784
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:16,040
The third is the cultivation of high-quality talents and the education of a disadvantaged one.

1785
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:22,400
These three are actually related to a free relationship, that is, a person with talent.

1786
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:25,840
Here are two questions to ask Mr. Shi

1787
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,680
first question please

1788
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:35,440
If your money is on May 20 next year, my colleague Dalin Hung

1789
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,280
If Luzumi Nakato has a third floor

1790
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:42,800
What do you think is the market impact on the sustainable development of Taiwan's agriculture?

1791
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:48,440
The second question is do you have any way to influence your money, colleague Dalin Hung

1792
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:52,040
because we know his expertise is in public

1793
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:55,040
game development for farming

1794
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:59,400
What kind of positive impact can you put forward and provide him with advice, thank you

1795
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,500
right

1796
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:04,500
ok i think i can answer one step

1797
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:08,700
i think chen hu is my immediate boss

1798
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:09,900
I interact with him a lot

1799
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:13,700
I believe he has a strong interest in the sustainable development of Taiwan's agriculture

1800
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:15,900
There must be a positive impact

1801
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:19,000
Now it means

1802
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:21,000
we have a plan

1803
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,700
is helping with this

1804
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:26,200
the rural back state problem

1805
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,400
Chen Hu is leading

1806
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,500
So he is concerned about agricultural issues

1807
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:30,800
know very well

1808
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,800
So I think he will give

1809
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:37,300
That is to say, if Tsai Ing-wen is elected

1810
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:42,000
he must be a good host

1811
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Then the second one will I have any influence

1812
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
then i will tell two stories

1813
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,200
My wife heard that Chen Jianren was nominated for vice president

1814
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,800
He said you stay away from him

1815
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:56,800
Then the second is

1816
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,300
I told Dean Li some of my methods

1817
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,500
That is, how to enforce these policies

1818
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,500
my wife said you go

1819
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,000
Brass less than a month

1820
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,500
Dean Li said you don't get a week without Lars

1821
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,500
so i think

1822
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:14,500
What I mean by this is

1823
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,500
need a comparison

1824
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,500
How can... a person like Chengwu

1825
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,500
he may stand

1826
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,500
we need a good

1827
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,500
Chairman of the Council of Agriculture

1828
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,500
but he needs to have

1829
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,000
Political School

1830
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,500
Can manage our legislative chambers

1831
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:34,500
I think the biggest problem is the legislation

1832
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:35,500
then this legislation

1833
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,500
Then the administrative law I mentioned

1834
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,000
Probably as long as you have a good county magistrate

1835
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
It is indeed possible to execute

1836
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
but to get to the bottom of it

1837
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,500
You want a permanent agricultural basic law

1838
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,000
that's probably

1839
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,500
but our legislature

1840
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,000
In fact, I read the papers to propose bills.

1841
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,500
So if you can be brave

1842
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,500
not brave

1843
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:57,500
Actively participate in this kind of worship

1844
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:58,500
you can disagree with me

1845
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,000
But I think we're right about this...

1846
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
be more concerned

1847
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,900
because we've all heard the farmhouse problem

1848
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,500
but you rarely hear

1849
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:07,500
There are people in Taipei who are openly discussing this issue

1850
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:12,400
So I think this is the participation of our society

1851
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,200
I think the most important

1852
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:17,500
Because the Legislative Yuan almost relies on public opinion to govern the country

1853
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:20,500
so you just let them know it's an important issue

1854
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:21,900
people are paying attention

1855
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:25,400
to ask

1856
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,800
I am New Deal Company

1857
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,000
My name is Lin

1858
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
hello please sit down

1859
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,900
ask now

1860
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:41,200
There used to be a Kaohsiung 131

1861
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:44,000
This seems good too

1862
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
How does it compare to this

1863
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,200
And our company has introduced this Ye Guangming

1864
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:52,800
This is Yan Tian's

1865
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:56,200
farming

1866
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,600
there is a peasant association

1867
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,000
Everyone has peasant officials and citizens

1868
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
We introduce them

1869
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
and then this

1870
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,000
There is Semite in California

1871
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
there is a us taiwanese

1872
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
their American company

1873
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
He is Hong Xinxiong

1874
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
he is a doctor

1875
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:28,000
where he produces people

1876
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
The rice on his side is called national defense rice

1877
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:36,000
It is given to Japanese geniuses every year

1878
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I have lived in other homes several times

1879
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:46,000
this person is very nice

1880
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
But he is also a doctor

1881
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Then there is a banquet in Japan recently

1882
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Water Pressure Yunmei

1883
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
This is inside our pentagon

1884
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Some here are good

1885
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,300
It's not good here, he's not, he's really good

1886
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:07,900
I want to take his original seed, but he won't give it to me

1887
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:11,400
He said, don't sell but fix

1888
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:15,300
He became patented, not as easy as Moonlight Rice

1889
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:18,300
So there's this synopsis aspect

1890
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,800
see what they do

1891
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:25,200
this tastes good too, what

1892
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:29,600
Comfort, and this certificate, and this processing can all be done

1893
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:35,500
It seems that this favorite music is the best in Japan at present

1894
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:40,000
This, sorry, I say this to

1895
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,200
I know, I know, thank you, thank you, because

1896
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:46,500
I think that there should be different strains in different places.

1897
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:51,400
As for Moonlight Rice, there should be several strains in Taiwan

1898
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:54,000
One of the strains, if I remember correctly

1899
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,600
If you go to Japan, you should have won the moonlight rice

1900
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,000
I won the moonlight rice in the previous year's competition last year

1901
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
so they

1902
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
It's the weird rice you mentioned

1903
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,700
Mr. Wang Qiangsheng

1904
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:08,000
i suggest you visit the farm

1905
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
He planted all his mutant species over there.

1906
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Then you even saw the very one

1907
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
What do you guys appreciate most now?

1908
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,300
Antioxidants?

1909
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,900
There's the red one over there, and the paper one.

1910
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:23,000
So that mutation bank over there is really good.

1911
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,600
Then you and him are also related

1912
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,800
Now their Council of Agriculture is also developing some rice

1913
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,300
come for viewing

1914
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:32,200
Because its leaf shape is very beautiful

1915
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:34,100
Then I believe that if you plug carefully

1916
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:36,400
It should be encouraged and there are beautiful ones

1917
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,700
so it's a pity

1918
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:40,000
because if you come to my church last week

1919
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,200
Because of the farm

1920
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:50,600
The one celebrating his 120th anniversary this week and last weekend

1921
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:53,100
So he got all his babies out

1922
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,200
Exhibited in his farm

1923
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:55,700
That

1924
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,440
we don't give him business

1925
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,000
OK, let me ask the Council of Agriculture again

1926
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,840
Because they usually have the one with the international waterway

1927
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:13,000
ok, we don't give it to us

1928
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:13,840
good

1929
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,620
those two words

1930
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:19,000
So Feast , Feast of Feast

1931
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Restraining harm is Yankee

1932
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Banquet

1933
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Banquet

1934
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Banquet

1935
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
good

1936
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Okay, thank you

1937
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
ok, here you go

1938
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I charge a lot for your speeches

1939
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,000
but your final conclusion

1940
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I feel like there is a contradiction

1941
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,000
You said the government led the people to participate in

1942
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
this is the first day

1943
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:02,740
The second is whether you have talked about

1944
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:05,340
Orchids, lots of fruit

1945
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:06,940
It's all made by the farmers themselves

1946
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:08,440
nothing to do with the government

1947
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,140
Aren't these two contradictory?

1948
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:14,640
OK

1949
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,140
ours

1950
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:21,140
Okay, let's take orchids as an example.

1951
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:24,640
The output value of our orchids is 4 billion

1952
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:29,040
Compared with the electronics industry

1953
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,080
A piece of cake

1954
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,140
When I came back in 2010

1955
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:35,080
Back in 2008 2009

1956
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:36,880
heard something

1957
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:38,840
Varma of America

1958
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:40,680
order

1959
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:42,740
Flower farmers in Taiwan

1960
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,940
the one that supplies him with varmas all over america

1961
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:49,840
If we eat this order

1962
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:53,440
That's about a few decades

1963
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:55,740
Our output value is definitely more than four billion

1964
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:57,440
but why do we

1965
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,640
Because we are not an agribusiness

1966
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,800
we are small farmers

1967
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,460
they may have some alliances

1968
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:04,460
so i think

1969
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:07,420
First our government does not have one

1970
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:09,420
What kind of venture capital fund do we have?

1971
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:11,920
We don't have an agricultural venture fund

1972
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,660
Council of Agriculture asks the government

1973
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:16,920
Asked for at least back from me

1974
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,420
We meet every year at the Council of Agriculture

1975
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:19,700
we both say it takes

1976
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:21,760
just don't have this fund

1977
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:25,220
Now there is a biomedical start-up fund

1978
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,420
But there is no farming

1979
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:28,160
so like this

1980
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:29,960
to become an agribusiness

1981
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:31,960
I think it's still a government policy

1982
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:33,580
We want a school of appearance

1983
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:35,680
So what we have now is wonderful

1984
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,420
correct

1985
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:38,920
but you have to deal with the future

1986
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:41,120
i think there is still a problem

1987
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:42,780
the second is

1988
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:44,320
I said the government should drive

1989
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,860
Then compare the above policy aspects

1990
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:49,280
allocation of land and water

1991
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,320
i think this has no government

1992
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:51,980
It's useless for you to do it tomorrow

1993
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:54,380
I'm talking about government-led

1994
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:56,860
we are involved in this

1995
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:58,660
you want to be big

1996
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,600
No, I mean that the first item and the second item you mentioned just now are contradictory

1997
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:05,400
Yeah

1998
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:10,600
I totally agree with your first item that the government leads the people to participate

1999
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:14,400
That is, our government does not pay much attention to agriculture at present.

2000
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:18,600
It is the carving of faces in rural areas that creates many, many problems

2001
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:19,400
uh-huh

2002
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:23,900
The funding for the research units of the agricultural institute you mentioned is not enough.

2003
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:24,400
right

2004
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,600
Many comparative research centers are also shrinking

2005
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,200
All the things in the research center are gone

2006
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:31,800
right

2007
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:36,300
So you say the government leads the people to participate in

2008
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:38,900
This may have a higher class

2009
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:43,500
That is, we want a good government, good representatives of public opinion, good representatives of public opinion

2010
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:44,400
or else

2011
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:51,700
In my idea, the government should be a good government

2012
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:54,200
But there are always times of disappointment

2013
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:54,600
right

2014
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,300
ok

2015
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,440
Occidental, personal matters are subject to thank you

2016
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:04,720
i want to ask two questions

2017
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:07,400
The first is that you just mentioned that

2018
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:08,640
In terms of waterways

2019
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:11,200
backcross

2020
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:13,080
this will take four years

2021
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:15,040
Then if in terms of genetic modification

2022
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:17,840
can shorten the period of this backcross

2023
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:18,760
This is the first question

2024
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:20,520
the second is

2025
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:23,400
Like the new varieties we pre-assessed

2026
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:25,840
That one is made in the improvement factory

2027
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,080
it's just a handful

2028
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,480
I am always thinking

2029
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:29,560
how does it expand to

2030
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:31,400
Let the whole province's rice be replanted

2031
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,200
how did this expand

2032
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,800
OK

2033
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,720
i think in general

2034
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:39,080
if you understand

2035
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:40,040
For example, what are we going to fight against?

2036
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:42,640
anti-what mechanism

2037
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:45,240
you usually just want

2038
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:46,960
Do 10,000 basic research first

2039
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,560
Then after knowing the mechanism

2040
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:49,880
which gene do you know

2041
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:52,360
Of course you have this basis in the future

2042
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:55,360
do genetic modification

2043
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,720
much faster in some crops

2044
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,960
But not now for waterways

2045
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,340
Because rice, for example, if I just want to find

2046
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:08,340
Rice is the same as rice because it has many species

2047
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:10,940
So it has this resistance

2048
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:15,340
So it's not that you have to do genetic modification

2049
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:18,740
That is to say, after you enter, we call it T1, the first generation

2050
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:21,440
You can't use the first generation because it's actually mixed

2051
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,740
You have fortified for generations

2052
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:25,400
So genetic modification is not available in the first generation

2053
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,460
i know what you mean

2054
01:38:27,460 --> 01:38:34,460
Of course the GMO will be irreplaceable at some point

2055
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:36,300
because you have like a banana

2056
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:38,300
Bananas you can't do crossbreeding

2057
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:39,560
Bananas reproduce asexually

2058
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:42,000
So you have to improve its traits

2059
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,060
The fastest you can do it with GM bananas

2060
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:49,360
so you

2061
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,960
My felacephy is to say

2062
01:38:57,460 --> 01:39:03,860
when possible

2063
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,600
you use monocular breathing

2064
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,100
that is if possible

2065
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:05,200
you use monocular breathing

2066
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:06,700
when necessary

2067
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:08,600
when you must

2068
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:10,900
use genetic energy

2069
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:15,900
Personally, I absolutely believe that genetic modification is very safe.

2070
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:18,800
But because it's not already a scientific question

2071
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:22,200
it's a political issue it's a social issue

2072
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:24,800
So you are here to take our scientist's point of view

2073
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,200
you have to solve the problem

2074
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:29,600
And you have to be able to make it easy for ordinary people to accept

2075
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:34,600
So the fastest way is to use monocular breathing

2076
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:36,500
Everyone wouldn't have that pattern

2077
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:39,000
But genetically modified things must be done

2078
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
because you have many places

2079
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:44,000
You can't do it with a traditional molecule

2080
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,900
so here is my opinion

2081
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:48,500
There is also a second question

2082
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:51,100
What is done and then given out after

2083
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:52,700
how can you do it

2084
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:54,700
Our Council of Agriculture has a

2085
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:56,700
It is our Taiwan agriculture

2086
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:59,200
That is to say, a place where the agricultural system is very complete

2087
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:00,300
they will

2088
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,640
So the farm reform factory is in direct contact with the farmers

2089
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:08,520
Then everywhere they will know

2090
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:13,160
Rice will grow better in this place because of its water and soil

2091
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:15,320
Therefore, the agricultural reform factory will recommend farmers

2092
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:19,320
That is to say, you go to plant a strain

2093
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:23,280
So why are the Taiwan stalks planted on Chishang?

2094
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:27,160
And now most of the west coast plants are Tainong No. 71

2095
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:30,160
So there are agricultural reform factories that are responsible for these aspects

2096
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:35,880
So we have the Council of Agriculture and this kind of policy of withdrawal

2097
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:36,840
and always

2098
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:38,600
so the system is very good

2099
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,560
ask that

2100
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:50,520
consult

2101
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:52,840
Spars

2102
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:56,840
I just heard you say that machine modification is safe? Is it true?

2103
01:40:56,840 --> 01:41:01,160
I am afraid that the so-called tofu will be broken

2104
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Dare to eat it? Is it really safe?

2105
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,600
Actually you

2106
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:14,000
Because of genetic modification, everyone is afraid that you have introduced foreign genes, right?

2107
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
do you eat flour

2108
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,400
do you know where that wheat comes from

2109
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,200
do beans matter

2110
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:25,800
without me talking about flour first

2111
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:29,800
wheat you know

2112
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:33,800
He is an extended species but he introduced

2113
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,800
Didn't know there were three different breeds of genes

2114
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,800
So he's a mix of a lot of alien genes

2115
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,800
So the genetically modified crops are actually just introducing a

2116
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:45,800
a foreign gene or two

2117
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:48,800
Well, in fact, you don’t need to look at the genes of all genetically modified foods.

2118
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:50,800
but to look at the safety of his food

2119
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:53,800
not only

2120
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:58,800
All countries Taiwan also has a very strict system called

2121
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,800
Food Safety Inspection

2122
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:04,400
All foods to be marketed for practicality

2123
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:08,000
have to go through a series of safety tests

2124
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Until now

2125
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,900
None of the genetically modified

2126
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:14,600
The soy you are talking about and the genetically modified corn

2127
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:18,200
so there will be insecurity

2128
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:21,800
and even if you talk about corn

2129
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:24,800
Genetically Modified Corn Is Likely Safer

2130
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,300
because I promise you if you buy corn

2131
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:31,500
It will be genetically modified without that insecticide

2132
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:32,500
or a mess

2133
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:34,200
I guarantee you have eaten pesticide

2134
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:37,500
Much more than genetically modified

2135
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:40,000
so you can eat with confidence

2136
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,500
I think you've been eating for a long time

2137
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,500
because Taiwan

2138
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:47,300
i told you earlier

2139
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:49,000
Taiwan does not import

2140
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,700
do not produce soybeans themselves

2141
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:53,400
We import without fainting

2142
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,000
You import genetically modified soybeans

2143
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
GMO soybeans

2144
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:57,800
We are not such imports

2145
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:59,900
We import is faint

2146
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,760
It depends on his quality, from level one to level ten

2147
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:05,440
Then when we grain merchants come in

2148
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,680
He doesn't care if you are genetically modified or will be genetically modified

2149
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:11,960
He started to sell and used the top-level ones as practical

2150
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:14,520
The top low ones are used as animal feed

2151
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:17,440
So any soymilk shop, tofu shop, or even Yiyimi

2152
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,120
I also told you that he will be genetically modified.

2153
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:20,120
he lied to you

2154
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:22,560
he definitely lied to you

2155
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,360
because you can't avoid

2156
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,120
Because Taiwan does not produce

2157
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:29,400
The corn you eat, I guarantee you 100% GMO

2158
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,160
because i told you earlier

2159
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:33,720
Because imported genetically modified corn

2160
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:34,600
you will never eat

2161
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:36,040
because it is hard and unpalatable

2162
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,200
what you eat what you eat is called

2163
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:39,040
Sweet Cone

2164
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:41,200
corn of utility

2165
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:43,120
Taiwan is 100% self-produced

2166
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:45,040
so you should be more careful

2167
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:47,920
Because there are many pesticides

2168
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,360
Because corn can easily cause that

2169
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:51,000
and

2170
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:54,000
So you are something like this instead

2171
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,080
you have to wash very

2172
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:57,400
soy milk is very safe

2173
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,360
And I promise you GMOs

2174
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:00,160
he eats naturally

2175
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
do you drink soy milk

2176
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:02,500
drink

2177
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:04,000
I can't drink now

2178
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I

2179
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
ah

2180
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
here

2181
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
good

2182
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
hello host

2183
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
thank you very much for your speech tonight

2184
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
It is true that there is a lot of harvest

2185
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
and say you are

2186
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
See Sustainability Issues Inside

2187
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Because it includes the part of food security

2188
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
include

2189
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
If we say Chinese is food security

2190
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Only two words of safety

2191
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,000
But if it's in English

2192
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Security and Safety issues

2193
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
you have discussed

2194
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
So my question is actually

2195
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Director Shi has already answered half of the answer just now

2196
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Because you just mentioned that

2197
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
What we're about to do is

2198
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
A second-generation green revolution

2199
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
because we were in the 1960s

2200
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
During the first green revolution

2201
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
At that time, it was only for the purpose of increasing food production.

2202
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
The extensive use of fertilizers and pesticides

2203
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
but did not consider saying

2204
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Problems that follow include pollution

2205
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
and subsequent generation of some

2206
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Farmer's Health Issues

2207
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
The Second Green Revolution

2208
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
words in your opinion

2209
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
because it involves

2210
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
also includes bringing a little bit of genetic modification and

2211
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,060
Some more general effects

2212
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:04,720
What you just mentioned is that

2213
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:06,200
May reduce dosage

2214
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,160
Reduce environmental pollution

2215
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:10,160
But say whether to consider saying

2216
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:11,920
If this goes on for a long time in the future

2217
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:12,660
will there be

2218
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:14,060
Speaking in a big environment

2219
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:15,820
Will it be friendly to the environment?

2220
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:17,920
Will there be some negative impact

2221
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:20,500
including species diversity

2222
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:22,660
Or those related effects that become harmful

2223
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:23,420
Thanks

2224
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:26,500
i want to answer this question

2225
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:30,420
Avision is relative

2226
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:35,420
Do you think genetically modified crops will affect biodiversity?

2227
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:39,420
my answer is yes but

2228
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:41,920
as long as i feel

2229
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,920
Since humans have agriculture

2230
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:46,920
as long as you have agricultural land

2231
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,920
no biodiversity

2232
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:50,420
Because in nature you don't see

2233
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:51,920
ten thousand rice fields

2234
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:52,420
rice field

2235
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:55,420
ten thousand cornfields

2236
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:59,420
Then your agriculture for thousands of years in the past few years

2237
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,100
The one that went through pesticides and recycling

2238
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:05,200
Your biological delusions have already

2239
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,600
where people are gone

2240
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:10,600
So if you say that I plant now

2241
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:12,400
This genetically modified vaccine is here

2242
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,400
Will it affect the delusion of creatures

2243
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,700
you don't exist anymore

2244
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:19,100
Because it has been followed by our human behavior

2245
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:21,300
Your biological arrogance has long since been destroyed

2246
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:23,600
Then you have to modify this gene

2247
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:24,800
If planted in the mountains

2248
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,000
of course i will affect

2249
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,800
But you plant ordinary waterways into the mountains

2250
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:31,800
You will affect your ecology as usual

2251
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:32,800
so i think

2252
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:35,300
That is to say, when you all look at this matter

2253
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:37,300
I think you must read relative

2254
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:40,800
That is to say, you are comparing it with the existing agriculture

2255
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,300
What are genetically modified crops?

2256
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:44,100
then i can talk to you

2257
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:45,800
it is definitely safer

2258
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:48,800
And it does less damage to the environment

2259
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:52,300
I don't know if this answers your question

2260
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:53,300
OK

2261
01:46:55,300 --> 01:46:56,800
Wang Mu

2262
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,000
It's the director. Just now you mentioned the problem of waterway febrile disease.

2263
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Then why the previously collected disease strains are relatively complete

2264
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
then almost none now

2265
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Is it because the brain farmer has used up the opportunity for technology research

2266
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:24,000
No, this has something to do with our agricultural policy

2267
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Didn't we talk about getting some of our

2268
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Humanization of government research units

2269
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:38,000
In that era, there were many soups

2270
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,000
And the Banana Research Institute mentioned by Dean Li

2271
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,000
And the county and city agricultural office, our agricultural cover merchant

2272
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Many excellent researchers and agricultural talents

2273
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
First-line research talents

2274
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Move to early retirement or speak badly

2275
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,000
This decade happens to be in turmoil

2276
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
it's them who are in turmoil

2277
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,700
To be changed to Cai Tang Chinese

2278
01:48:01,700 --> 01:48:03,900
When a lot of people can't surrender

2279
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:07,500
Because if you want Cai Tang Chinese

2280
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:12,100
So he wants to use Taitang's point of view

2281
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:13,700
He wants to make a profit

2282
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:15,300
so he

2283
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:16,600
He actually has a Taiwan soup

2284
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:20,300
In fact, our sugar industry in Taiwan

2285
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:21,000
he is the kingdom

2286
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,400
But then I stopped planting this kind of sugar

2287
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,200
We have a lot of species

2288
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,100
the candy is gone

2289
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:28,300
are now in Guangxi

2290
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:30,000
Our Nanhua has many kinds of origin

2291
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,600
gone now

2292
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:32,500
because

2293
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:33,400
Just say Cai Tanghua

2294
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:34,900
They feel that they will be humanized by Cai Tang

2295
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:35,600
not national

2296
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:36,800
he won't do it

2297
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,100
researchers are

2298
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:39,100
so i said

2299
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:40,400
The collection of physiological data

2300
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,800
That decade happened to be

2301
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:43,500
rock the boat

2302
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:46,100
In fact, some people said that Cai Tang should be Chinese

2303
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:47,600
but then it didn't work out

2304
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:48,700
because of too much resistance

2305
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:49,900
But these ten years

2306
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:53,700
It's the time when the physiological summary has not been collected

2307
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:55,000
That

2308
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,800
luckily

2309
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,400
Liu Dajiang

2310
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:00,100
And the current director once went in

2311
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,400
attach great importance to this

2312
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:03,240
so we start again now

2313
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:05,640
Go to various locations in the former province to start collecting

2314
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:07,760
Then Chiayi divides all diseases

2315
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,440
He is in the special city every year

2316
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,560
So now we are also working on the division of labor

2317
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:16,040
Traditional physiological niches are also doing it now

2318
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:17,200
this right

2319
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:19,760
That is to say, I think I should go down later.

2320
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,840
because it will be inherited

2321
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:27,800
I am also a member of the Academia Sinica

2322
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:30,120
This is also the owner of this city

2323
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:32,120
Member of the Agricultural Center

2324
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:35,160
I have two words that I want to share with you

2325
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:37,240
the first is

2326
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:38,920
Just now the mayor said

2327
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:41,160
our farmers in taiwan

2328
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:44,600
This high level is the highest level in the world

2329
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:46,720
Dean Li also said just now

2330
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:49,720
His is just a half-open small comment

2331
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:52,080
I will share with you

2332
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:55,000
three things

2333
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:57,760
Taiwanese farmers

2334
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,200
When participating in the Agricultural Center

2335
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
A Mr. Cai called and said you want to come and see

2336
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,000
How is our Nanhua planted?

2337
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,000
When I went down, I went down with three colleagues in the firm.

2338
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:18,000
What I saw was this factory that was about five times bigger than this room

2339
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
There is a ditch in front

2340
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Make it impossible for ordinary cars to enter

2341
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
There are wolf dogs in it

2342
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
He said that you people who engage in learning never want to

2343
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,000
look down on us

2344
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:34,000
I'll show you today what we look like

2345
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
all his techniques

2346
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Because I participated in it when I was abroad

2347
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Monsanto's so-called most of the research work and so on

2348
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I see their tissue culture

2349
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
really world class

2350
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
But they say we go abroad

2351
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,000
When we came to the Dutch people, they regarded us as bounty soldiers.

2352
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Now to Taiwan we come back

2353
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:58,000
You are all in college

2354
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
nothing never comes

2355
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
come see us

2356
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
really very embarassing

2357
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,000
just feel ashamed

2358
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
their technical system, etc.

2359
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
still there today

2360
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
so many feathers of our blue flower

2361
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
under such circumstances

2362
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Now that is called seed fate is still there

2363
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Not only that, it's just a blue flower

2364
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Our Taiwan is the one that makes that fish in the world

2365
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
called invitro fertilization

2366
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
in vitro fertilization

2367
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,000
also very powerful

2368
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,000
We in Taiwan can make that grafted plant

2369
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Even the bean sprouts can be grafted

2370
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,000
So we have these awesome systems

2371
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
But it sounds like arguing

2372
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Our government doesn't care

2373
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
everyone buried there

2374
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Another one is

2375
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
I've been thinking about it for a while

2376
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Our Agricultural Center

2377
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,000
very myself personally at least very anxious

2378
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,000
We don't seem to have done a single agricultural thing

2379
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Even if you want to do it, you can't do it well

2380
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Also since this psychological

2381
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Since the benefactor came

2382
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
several years

2383
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
five or six years

2384
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
get the system out

2385
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Everyone saw it today

2386
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
so i feel

2387
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
I won't panic like that

2388
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,000
OK would not feel like saying

2389
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
what happened

2390
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
It seems to be these two

2391
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
for your reference

2392
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Thanks

2393
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Thanks

2394
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Yes, our government is doing something

2395
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
that's me

2396
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Government’s BTC this year

2397
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
That's the one

2398
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Every year the government organizes a

2399
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
biotechnology summit

2400
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Then I told the Council of Agriculture

2401
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Director Lu Wusheng

2402
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000
then we will

2403
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Together we have planned a

2404
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
The future is the next five or ten years

2405
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
so-called systems biology

2406
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:54,000
The general description of bringing high technology to Taiwan

2407
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Then we lock the top ten

2408
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
The top ten general descriptions of Taiwan are

2409
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
We use in Taiwan

2410
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,000
then also

2411
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Top 10 general descriptions of our competitiveness in the world market

2412
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
We are going to introduce new technology

2413
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Establish a so-called industry-government-university-research alliance

2414
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
researchers from Academia Sinica

2415
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,000
university researchers

2416
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
From farmers to farmers we all have a link

2417
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:23,000
The Committee of Agriculture of this meeting and request has been sent out

2418
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,000
But that is the next year's meeting

2419
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
so i think probably not

2420
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
because of the change of dynasty

2421
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
maybe next year again

2422
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
But I think we've planned

2423
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
so there is doing

2424
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,000
This is one about the bioeconomy

2425
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Another COA has planned a project called Productivity 4.0

2426
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
That is to put the so-called big data

2427
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
And that modern manage management approach

2428
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,000
To get flower show agribusiness

2429
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
so someone is doing it

2430
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
so now you have a plan

2431
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
someone has to do it

2432
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
This is very important

2433
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,000
yes i want not only in the middle

2434
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Central Plains I want to be in college at COA

2435
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,200
there are still many scientists

2436
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:06,600
and these executives

2437
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:08,480
everybody wants to do something

2438
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:10,800
that's why i say this

2439
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,400
That's why I'm still quite optimistic

2440
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:13,440
I am optimistic by nature

2441
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:15,600
So I think there will still be improvement

2442
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:19,400
Li En is

2443
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:22,040
it's okay lee

2444
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:22,840
Thanks

2445
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:24,200
ok please

2446
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:27,000
that just mentioned

2447
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:32,000
We have some that can be biologically controlled

2448
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:38,800
When producing organisms to resist that germ

2449
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:45,400
that could reduce our use of pesticides

2450
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:52,400
So how to do a promotion of these

2451
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:55,720
And how to study the classics

2452
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:56,520
if go for it

2453
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:59,920
This may be a major feature we are facing

2454
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Yes, this is actually ours should be from last year

2455
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:17,000
It is the Council of Agriculture that plans our country's major agricultural research topic in the next ten years

2456
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:20,000
One is the time of living beings and the other is the time of living beings

2457
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
If you go back and read the report from last year

2458
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:29,000
So there will probably be more or less the experience of this aspect coming out.

2459
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:35,000
In fact, many people in Taiwan are now doing so-called biological research

2460
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
But it's a pity it's only half done

2461
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Because they often find useful bacteria

2462
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:45,000
In fact, if you go to Taiwan carefully to find out about that

2463
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Because Mr. Wu and I are in charge of the so-called national research program in Taiwan.

2464
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Then you know that there are many useful bacteria

2465
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
also know what he can cure

2466
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
but can't leave the country

2467
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,160
because they didn't make it like we did

2468
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:07,400
That is to say, what are you like other than identification?

2469
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:10,440
The structure of this compound

2470
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:12,120
You also need to know how it is synthesized

2471
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:13,920
you need to know under what circumstances

2472
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:15,920
it can be mass produced

2473
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:19,240
because the lotus i visited

2474
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:22,000
It is the great merchant of the biological order

2475
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,400
It has a ton or two of flower yeast sticks

2476
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:31,120
You have to be competitive

2477
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:35,520
You just want a ton of production costs

2478
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:38,560
The training machine costs 1,400 Taiwan dollars

2479
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,280
But we use in the lab

2480
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:44,360
probably more than ten thousand yuan

2481
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:46,120
that is to say if you want a ton

2482
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:47,720
so this down

2483
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:49,480
That is, you have to continue to do it

2484
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:52,120
Many teachers in Taiwan now have training

2485
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:54,480
But the problem is you don't know the mechanics of it

2486
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:55,800
you don't know what condition it is in

2487
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:59,880
This bacteria will produce the compound you want

2488
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,200
often the first generation is useful

2489
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:02,800
Farmers go back to raise themselves

2490
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,200
or your company do it yourself

2491
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:05,700
Often the second generation is useless

2492
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:07,200
So many big factories

2493
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:10,200
Like Xinlong and Lianhua

2494
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:11,200
they came out

2495
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:12,400
farmers scold

2496
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,200
Because you sell it seems to be useful for the first year

2497
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:15,200
useless in the second year

2498
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:18,000
It's the comparison you want to do scientifically.

2499
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,500
this is the most important

2500
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:20,300
don't worry

2501
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:22,700
If you know the mechanism

2502
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:23,700
what companies do you know

2503
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:25,800
You can go abroad with Quality Control

2504
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:28,700
So like our white jade archaea

2505
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:30,600
The patent we are applying for now is

2506
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:32,700
Mainland China America

2507
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:36,100
We just want to connect the Asian market with the US

2508
01:57:36,100 --> 01:57:38,300
So back to Dean Li's words

2509
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:41,000
What does this government do?

2510
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,300
help us open the way

2511
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:45,300
we have a foreign trade association

2512
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:47,100
But they won't do it for farmers

2513
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:48,500
do this

2514
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:50,700
So this is where the government can focus

2515
01:57:50,700 --> 01:57:52,700
There are actually many details

2516
01:57:52,700 --> 01:57:53,300
I didn't speak

2517
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:55,800
I'm on this policy today

2518
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:57,000
but many implementation aspects

2519
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
You are still a place where the government can focus

2520
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,000
still so much

2521
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,400
The key is to have money

2522
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:05,100
So the first thing is to delete the 50 billion Laolong annuity

2523
01:58:07,700 --> 01:58:08,900
your last question first

2524
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:10,400
Thanks

2525
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:16,200
You mentioned a very serious problem in Taiwan

2526
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:18,200
It's food citizens' problem

2527
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:20,900
Only 30% of myself

2528
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:22,500
this is very low

2529
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:28,400
Of course, improving the variety of Dao species is a very important way

2530
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:32,900
Do you want to consider other than rice

2531
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:36,100
Species such as Potato

2532
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:40,300
or something else to increase Taiwan's food supply

2533
01:58:40,300 --> 01:58:44,600
I remember when Wang Guoren was renting an apartment years ago

2534
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:46,000
he's doing it

2535
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,700
At that time, I was also developing this aspect

2536
01:58:49,700 --> 01:58:50,500
have no idea

2537
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:54,000
Because now we eat more than just rice

2538
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,800
Some people eat very little rice now

2539
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:58,400
changed to face

2540
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,200
these grains

2541
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:03,000
Should it also be considered

2542
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,600
these issues

2543
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:08,600
Yes, this is actually 30 meters

2544
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:09,600
is absolutely enough

2545
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:11,400
I count 30%

2546
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:13,400
The heat we design

2547
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:14,800
70% are medium

2548
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,800
That is to say where the food comes from

2549
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:18,200
70% are from outside

2550
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:19,800
So your most important thing to solve

2551
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:21,800
actually bones

2552
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:23,800
the Council of Agriculture

2553
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:25,800
In fact, we in Taiwan had soybeans in the early days

2554
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:27,800
that's in taiwan

2555
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:29,800
In fact, natural gas is not suitable for planting

2556
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:31,400
other bone species

2557
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:33,000
rice is natural

2558
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,400
But neither soy nor sorghum

2559
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:37,400
but we have a pre-release for a while

2560
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:39,800
soybeans that can be grown in taiwan

2561
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:42,800
But you have to pre-produce new varieties

2562
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,400
To be able to really push out the plant

2563
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:47,000
Yield, quality, everything should be good

2564
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Now the COA starts

2565
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
have this plan

2566
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:55,600
They're the ones that are going to start pre-soybeans

2567
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:58,200
That is to say, the varieties suitable for growing in Taiwan

2568
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:00,200
that so they go from there

2569
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,840
From the strict warehouse of the serious name

2570
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,840
There are some of this encouraging

2571
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:07,840
That strange wheat has

2572
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:09,340
so i want roommates here

2573
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:11,340
but not a lot of people here

2574
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:13,340
so maybe that means

2575
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:15,340
roommate in need

2576
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:17,340
because if you really want to

2577
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:21,340
Don't root those fields

2578
02:00:21,340 --> 02:00:23,340
I think the most important thing is to

2579
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:25,340
produce other encouragement

2580
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:28,340
Even the so-called production so-called feed name

2581
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:31,840
Because our greatest consumption

2582
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:34,840
In fact, you raise pigs and chickens

2583
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:36,840
these things

2584
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:38,340
So you have to help Taiwan's food security

2585
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:40,340
Everyone eats a bowl of rice every day

2586
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:41,840
It's all bowls

2587
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:44,340
Because it is a surprise demand

2588
02:00:44,340 --> 02:00:46,340
if you eat more

2589
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:48,840
That means the price of rice will rise

2590
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:50,340
So this is a

2591
02:00:50,340 --> 02:00:52,340
you change your eating habits

2592
02:00:52,340 --> 02:00:54,340
the second is

2593
02:00:54,340 --> 02:00:56,340
because you have less meat

2594
02:00:56,340 --> 02:01:00,340
Your bottom faces the bottom of this encouragement

2595
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
less inside

2596
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,840
The other one is the government's business

2597
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:03,840
just to start planting

2598
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,840
Even rice can be used as fodder

2599
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:08,340
So now the Agricultural Committee forbids us to say this

2600
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:09,340
because you talk about feed rice

2601
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:13,340
He wonders why the rice you produce is used as feed

2602
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:15,340
He's afraid of you two getting together

2603
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:18,000
So we have to think of a better one now

2604
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
That is, if you use it as feed rice

2605
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,000
You probably don't need that high quality

2606
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:26,840
You can just go for a lot of that sort of thing

2607
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:29,340
So there are some scholars

2608
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:31,180
Then we were doing it during the seminar

2609
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:35,680
Several agricultural cover factories of the Council of Agriculture are slowly working on it

2610
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:38,080
But maybe there needs to be a country

2611
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:41,080
For example, another national project

2612
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:42,380
plan this down

2613
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:44,880
Then I feel like it's not like it used to be

2614
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:46,240
from the bottom one

2615
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,740
proposed by the researchers themselves

2616
02:01:47,740 --> 02:01:49,780
but you want a top down

2617
02:01:49,780 --> 02:01:51,140
That is to say, task marriage

2618
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:53,580
Which group of you do what kind of things

2619
02:01:53,580 --> 02:01:54,440
do this

2620
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:56,580
That is to timely benefit

2621
02:01:56,580 --> 02:01:58,080
what we need in the next ten years

2622
02:01:58,120 --> 02:01:59,720
Then mix this job down

2623
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:00,080
then i think

2624
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Taiwan can do it, absolutely no problem

2625
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
I will leave the last minute to Dean Li.

2626
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Because I just challenged you to say that your two things are contradictory

2627
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
so i'm going to save you

2628
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Thank you Dean Li

2629
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:21,000
It is very important that the government takes the lead in people's participation

2630
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
because it didn't work

2631
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:27,000
That's why I've been talking about the measurement points of Taiwan's farmers.

2632
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:31,000
But you just talked about the food supply rate of 33%

2633
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Near future

2634
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,000
When the world's food supply is not enough for everyone to eat

2635
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Taiwan, whose food supply rate is low, is the first to be hurt

2636
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:50,000
This is a problem that the government should take the lead in solving

2637
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:55,000
So you were talking about problems like this farmhouse Hugh

2638
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Many of these issues are to be addressed by the government

2639
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
We now say that the United States has a lot of pressure

2640
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:07,000
The markets of our agricultural products are all open

2641
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:13,000
But is our participation in this TPP good for farmers?

2642
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:17,000
He did a lot of good things for the government, but it will be miserable in the future

2643
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:21,000
These things are good government for us

2644
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
representative of the good people

2645
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
this is a very important thing

2646
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
That's why I just said I heard you make a rescue

2647
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
we didn't do that

2648
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Only then did I bring up the highlights of many farmers in Taiwan

2649
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
we are good

2650
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
The first point is done

2651
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
we can have a good future

2652
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
so

2653
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,000
don't listen to your rescue

2654
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Thank you Li Yanze

2655
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
thank you

2656
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Great speech thank you all

2657
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
thank you
