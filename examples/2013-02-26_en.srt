00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Academia Sinica's February Governor's Salary Banquet Lecture Begins

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We ask Vice President Huang Bansheng to host for us

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
thank you all distinguished guests good night everyone

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Good night

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Today was supposed to be hosted by Vice President Chen Jianren

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But because he's going abroad, I'm the agent

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then next week it seems to be me too

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Next week's Humanities

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
so i'm going to read the speech

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Because I'm the Associate Dean for Humanities

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
so relatively unfamiliar

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Feel sorry

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Welcome to today's feast of knowledge

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Everyone knows that the Feast of Knowledge is

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Academia Sinica is a very important activity to promote popular science education

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
have been around for a long time

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Every month we invite experts and scholars from various fields inside and outside the school

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Come here to talk about the latest academic research and scientific development

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It is our pleasure to invite you to our hospital to divide and administer biology tonight

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Research Fellow

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Ms. Bien

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let's talk about world food security and crisis

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
where to go

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Well, everyone saw that the self-introduction of the academician mentioned

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Because he saw his inner and outer grandfathers as eggs since he was a child

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
See this farmer and nature Hakata

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So he chose his

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
subject of this study

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
is rice

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Then he started from the university and research institute

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,760
I studied at the Department of Occupational Diseases of Central University

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,960
Department of Occupational Pathology

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,640
Then go to the United States to apply for a license

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,120
After receiving a Ph.D. in pathology from the University of Arkansas

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,360
Postdoctoral research in the United States

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,320
The hospital came back to our hospital in 1989

37
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,480
Institute of Molecular Biology Continuing Research

38
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,520
Choose the most local

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,080
and is the most important food crop in the world

40
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,840
Rice as research material

41
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,520
So far, many breakthrough studies have found that

42
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,360
For example, the discovery of a gene that controls flood tolerance in rice

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,960
Level Molecular Mechanism

44
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,680
Unraveling only rice seeds among all stocks for decades

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,400
The secret to germination and growth in water

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,600
The results were published in important international journals

47
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,800
Hospital doctors are also invited to speak at international conferences

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,920
Speech to domestic and foreign organizations

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,440
And won many domestic and foreign awards

50
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,960
Elected as a Fellow of the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World in 2005

51
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,040
Elected to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2005

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
In 2012, that is, last year, he was elected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Since 1993, the academician successfully completed the world's first rice gene transfer using agrobacterium

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He continues to use genetic engineering technology to improve rice varieties

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Developed many innovative biotechnologies

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He also led the teams of Chung Hsing University and Asia University in the Institute of Agriculture, Academia Sinica

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
From 2003 to 2012, a huge rice map was completed

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Mutant stock and gene database

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Discovered the functions of many important genes

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Recently, BioGate, a foundation funded by BioGate, has received funding

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Study how to increase rice photosynthesis efficiency to yield

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Significantly enhance the international life of rice research in Taiwan

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Then in another introduction

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He also mentioned that the population has been increasing because

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
However, there is obviously no significant increase in food

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Such a game is actually a very

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,500
a challenging question

68
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,000
last year

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
ah

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
group just

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The Secretary-General of the Chinese Academy of Sciences came to the Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
because that day

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
When all the officers don't know where to go

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I had to meet him

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
he raised a question

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
he just said

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Pope is against genetic modification

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
this

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
this

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
ah

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
rice

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
he obviously

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Is my report right?

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
if i am wrong i will

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll be better anyway

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
this love

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He said but the pope is the pope who just abdicated

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
against genetic modification

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He said that because the Pope in his youth

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
study in germany

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Influenced by Heidegger's philosophy

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Then Heidegger is of course the second century

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
very important philosophy

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
one of the most important philosophers

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
He opposes excessive intervention and destruction

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
but he said

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He thinks he sees things differently than the Pope

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
pope your people your believers

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What a sorrow

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
How can you not modify his genes

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
have more of this

102
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,760
So I guess I'm hosting today's talk

103
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,280
Reminds me of this conversation last year

104
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Then I think today's topic is very meaningful

105
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,760
It is world food security and crisis

106
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
not where to go but where to go

107
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,040
we applaud

108
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Yu Xiuyan

109
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,040
good

110
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,040
Vice President Wang thank you for the introduction

111
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,520
and good night everyone

112
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,520
Good night

113
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,520
Thank you so much for a hard day

114
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Then I have to come here for class in the evening

115
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,040
I wish to say this is not a serious class

116
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,520
because what we are going to talk about today

117
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,520
Is it related to our current life and future life

118
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,920
are closely related

119
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,520
is a very important topic

120
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,520
we should all know

121
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,520
I hope that you will finally feel that

122
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
don't need this trip

123
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
I'll wait

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,960
This is because I watched this speech

125
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,000
Queued for two hours is a bit long

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,300
Then I hope that it can be done within an hour and a half

127
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,700
end it within

128
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,600
and leave some time for people to ask this question

129
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,200
because it's a matter of great concern

130
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,900
I often go out to lecture in class

131
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,200
really everyone cares

132
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,400
Then I feel that there are many places I don’t understand

133
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,700
Then we need to make some clarifications

134
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,400
The media is also very concerned about this issue.

135
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,500
You can always watch

136
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
The media often come to visit me

137
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,800
discuss these issues

138
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,000
So I think the media, the people

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,500
In fact, they are very concerned about this issue

140
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,700
I feel like it's just the government that doesn't really care

141
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,600
So I hope there is still a chance

142
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,000
enable them to understand the seriousness of the problem

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,500
So let's start now with what I'm going to talk about

144
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,600
So in this twentieth century

145
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,100
In the past 100 years, our technology has advanced very fast

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,800
From burning this without a light to being able to use a computer now

147
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,000
Do various searches with Google

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,500
Then from this ship to space, it is said that it can fly to the sky

149
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,800
technology advances very fast

150
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,000
But at the same time, in this one hundred years

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Our population has also nearly quadrupled

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,300
The rate of increase of this population

153
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,300
This one was written from 1750

154
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,300
you see 1500 years

155
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,300
15 about 607 years later

156
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,300
From the beginning, the speed of increase is very fast

157
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,300
wait a minute we'll mention there was a green revolution

158
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,300
was started in 1960

159
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,300
until almost the end of 2000

160
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,300
around this time

161
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,300
during the first green revolution

162
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,300
The population is growing at its fastest rate

163
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,300
Now our population increase is not over

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
did not stop

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
actual birth rate

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's actually going down

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But because of these populations

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
In the next 30, 40 years

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
he will start

170
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No 20, 30 years

171
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
will begin to have many children

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
so this is a

173
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It will continue to be the cause of our population pressure

174
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
the distribution of the population

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
From Africa Latin America Asia Oceania

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
North America Europe or Worldwide

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You can see that Africa is indeed the most populous

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
latin america asia

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But what about the rate of population increase?

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
this different color

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
are saying

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
it's at a different time

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Indeed, it has been decreasing

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
so far

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
rate of population increase

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
In fact, there is no rate of death

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
how high is it

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
One is 2.5% One is 2.2%

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
so we all know

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
population cannot increase

191
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
can't be that fast

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,760
But the problem is that so many people exist

193
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,960
it is going to have a baby

194
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,760
Then how do we feed so many people

195
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,600
At the same time, a very important issue related to food is energy.

196
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,600
The proportion of this energy

197
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,100
Oil 37%

198
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,600
Coal 25%

199
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Then Natural Gas 23%

200
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,400
Other very small proportions are some other energy sources

201
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
What about nuclear power?

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,100
Press 6% again

203
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,600
That's biomass

204
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,000
reproductive energy

205
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,100
And then hydrogen or solar wind and so on

206
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,300
Its proportion is actually very low

207
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,700
Of course, what else is hot?

208
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,300
there are others this and others

209
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,700
it's sun hot

210
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,000
that's solar and so on

211
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,300
So our share of renewable energy

212
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,800
So far there is no way to improve

213
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,400
because it costs too much

214
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,500
The current energy

215
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,800
relatively low price

216
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,500
So everyone is interested in the development of this renewable energy

217
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,000
not so positive

218
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,200
That's just a few days ago

219
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,300
What about our gasoline?

220
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,460
This gas once in Taiwan

221
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,460
rose to an all-time high

222
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,420
Although it has dropped a little these days

223
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,160
But I believe this number will still be a normal

224
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,620
In this way, the energy is actually reduced.

225
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,620
Many of the things we mentioned just now

226
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,780
various energy sources that currently exist

227
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,540
Able to use in addition to coal

228
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,540
It can be used for more than two hundred years

229
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,200
Most of the others are around fifty years old

230
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,540
gasoline or natural gas

231
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,380
natural gas course most recent usa

232
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,920
it has found some

233
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,620
oily natural gas

234
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,740
so yes things are changing a bit

235
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,620
There are other sources of energy like remineralization

236
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,580
about fifty years

237
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,420
So everyone is speculating on nuclear energy

238
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,080
About fifty years

239
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,080
Because it's useless in the future

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So the energy goes down like this

241
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This is how the population rises

242
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But the speed at which our food is produced

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
actually slow down

244
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Such a gap between population and food

245
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Let's see now that this is 2010

246
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
We are still at the beginning

247
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Nearly 40 years to come

248
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
such a long time

249
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
How do we fill this big gap

250
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
it's a big challenge

251
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
so many people

252
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
every mouth

253
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Every mouth has something to eat

254
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
How can we produce enough of this food

255
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
to feed so many people

256
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This is where we study plants

257
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
research in agriculture

258
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
study of rice

259
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We often think about this question

260
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But I think people who do medicine

261
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
probably don't think about it

262
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
people in medicine want to say

263
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
people are still healthy

264
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
grow thinner

265
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,640
But I was at the United Daily News 10 years ago

266
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,680
I wrote an article at that time

267
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,320
It is said that a healthy and long-lived human being may not have enough to eat in a decade or two

268
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,040
So it's been 10 years

269
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,920
I was talking about ten or twenty years

270
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,080
But now it's been 10 years

271
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,920
In fact, the problem is getting worse

272
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,480
That doesn't seem to have attracted too much attention.

273
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,080
let's start now

274
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,800
Let me tell you first

275
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,240
Where is the serious form of the problem to be addressed today

276
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,520
But first let me give you some background

277
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,400
That is, how does our food come from?

278
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,320
Then our human culture actually followed agriculture

279
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,720
3.8 billion years ago

280
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,680
Life begins on our planet

281
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
and then successively

282
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,960
Then some various creatures came out.

283
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
what about this flower

284
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,140
Where's the first flower and insect?

285
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,880
Appeared about 130,000,000 years ago

286
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,080
Homo sapiens really have such a developed mind

287
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,780
What about this award?

288
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,280
appeared between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago

289
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,080
So in the history of this earth

290
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,080
came very late

291
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,080
But it is the smartest animal

292
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,580
but also the most destructive animal

293
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,160
what about our ancestors

294
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,880
when it first started

295
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,160
he hunts

296
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,160
He runs wherever there are animals

297
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,860
That's why it migrates everywhere

298
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,960
So from Africa 130,000 years ago

299
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,660
Start migrating to Europe

300
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,360
Then this Asia

301
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,360
Then to America

302
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,960
such a migration

303
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,840
That's what our ancestors said

304
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,440
Wow, it's really tiring to fight all over the place.

305
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,040
But no one owns a grocery store

306
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,400
how do we settle down

307
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:14,120
Do we still want to keep pulling like this?

308
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,000
so what

309
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,720
They found out one day that there seemed to be some food somewhere

310
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,440
can we stop there

311
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,000
can be used as food

312
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,600
So in the beginning, they won't keep walking

313
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,080
At the beginning, it was a little bit closer to the area of ​​grain production.

314
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,600
start walking around there

315
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,280
And in the end, I found this grain

316
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,320
We can also plant it to reproduce it

317
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,840
So when more and more food is planted

318
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,960
it settles down

319
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,000
So the ancestors settled down

320
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,240
So now there are still many chairs in the world

321
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,000
That is, we can see that this was developed by human beings.

322
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Gikyo

323
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,960
In addition to planting this

324
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,540
Of course humans are just speaking from Africa

325
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,400
means from africa

326
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,840
to various countries

327
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,040
After that, everyone started to grow this crop

328
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,440
He also started to improve

329
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,740
Then many places are doing this at the same time

330
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,640
So 10,000 years ago

331
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,140
In this America they have corn

332
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,140
pumpkins, beans, etc.

333
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,440
Thirteen thousand years ago in Europe there were

334
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,680
wheat barley beans

335
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
that big

336
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
What about China nine thousand years ago

337
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,180
started with soybeans and so on

338
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,080
So what about this culture?

339
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,580
is in many places

340
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,980
while developing

341
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,080
Then our ancestors were very powerful

342
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,380
from them to us

343
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,240
this latest this

344
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,680
Where's the breeder?

345
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,680
Breeding techniques that can be exploited

346
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,580
This crop can be improved

347
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,020
So for thousands of years

348
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,020
Humans have used breeding

349
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,600
to engineer the genes of countless crops

350
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,900
this is raw corn

351
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,540
it encourages very little

352
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,860
the shell is very hard

353
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,600
you can hardly bite

354
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,400
that's the corn now

355
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,300
This is the old rice

356
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,900
As soon as the bones grow up, they fall down

357
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,700
just fall

358
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,100
fell into the water

359
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,800
That's the current rice

360
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,600
that's wheat

361
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,800
this is tomato

362
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,500
This former tomato is now a tomato

363
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,800
In the past, it was like a sunflower, like a small wild flower

364
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,200
Now it can be as big as a pot

365
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,100
So our jade seed scientists are very powerful

366
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,500
These different crops can be

367
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,000
make it into the present we can see

368
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,900
Such delicious food

369
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,600
So this is actually other than plants

370
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,800
Where is our main line?

371
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,000
Also started to make this jade seed of many different plants

372
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,800
This includes a lot of domestic animals

373
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,700
Jiaqin

374
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,300
Then you see this home piano is very powerful

375
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,000
the bird

376
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
There are many kinds of chicken

377
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Pre-order a variety of different varieties like this

378
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,500
what about the animals

379
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,000
pig grows bigger

380
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
From wild boar to domestic pig

381
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
cow

382
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
from bison great

383
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
become a smaller cow

384
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
etc. various

385
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
that's great

386
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Watching dogs can make such a big difference

387
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
big to small

388
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's all about taro seeds

389
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What about taro seeds?

390
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
In fact, genes are constantly changing.

391
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Genetics are constantly mutating

392
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
At the same time, humans are also transforming their own experience.

393
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
We went from having to climb a tree to pick

394
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
banana start

395
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
like a monkey

396
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Then slowly we can stand up

397
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
can tear or something

398
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
can work

399
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But because now Google

400
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Our people are starting to recover again

401
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
with our ancestors

402
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
almost

403
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
lie down again

404
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
often mostly

405
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I often lie on this table again

406
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
so what about humans

407
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
also modifying our own genes

408
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,260
Are you going to get married and have kids?

409
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,760
Generations are different

410
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,460
OK

411
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,960
ok then again

412
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,260
let's talk again

413
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,000
Our Traditional Breeding Techniques

414
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,760
Why can we seal the doctor's food

415
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,160
Breeding?

416
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,460
What about the crops of the natural world?

417
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,260
it is likely to have a lot of variation

418
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,760
like childbearing as an example

419
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,760
it has

420
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,260
The bone ear is very big

421
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,360
some are very small

422
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,060
so our ancestors were smart

423
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,500
then start putting

424
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,060
What about the relatively large seed of encouragement?

425
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,020
start to breed

426
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,960
because in fact it's

427
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,260
What about this Yumi package?

428
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,160
big and small

429
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,720
It has something to do with its genetic inheritance

430
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,320
So after many generations

431
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,060
Such breeding should be selected

432
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,420
now we can see

433
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,320
Such an excellent rice variety

434
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,160
What about this evidence?

435
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,320
is in mohigan

436
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,920
Because rice farming started from this side of Central America

437
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,520
Nakanami

438
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,280
Yumi

439
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,080
mohiganfa

440
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Maize was discovered 7,000 years ago

441
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The fossils they dug up were so small

442
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Then it was discovered that the dug out was getting bigger and bigger

443
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That is, as recently as five hundred years ago,

444
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Already fossils have gotten so big

445
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
so this is a proof

446
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's the corn seed

447
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Let the size of this bone marrow continue to increase

448
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So the jade seed of corn actually comes from

449
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Start this with many branches

450
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The bone grains are few and hard

451
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Until now its branches have become few

452
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
basically a trunk

453
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Then what about the corn produced

454
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
This becomes a big bone

455
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So reducing the branches increases the size of the bone grain

456
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So is the rice

457
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
This rice is a very important grain

458
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Then our main fairy is very smart

459
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
In this I just started talking about

460
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The Lord Immortal breathes there

461
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Then maybe take the day...

462
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
to the water's edge

463
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,400
just see the water

464
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,240
grow a certain plant

465
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,800
Most other plants do not grow

466
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,800
only it is long

467
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,560
it has encouragement

468
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,840
This is the origin of rice

469
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,600
But the encouragement at that time

470
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,040
fall off easily

471
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,240
then fall into the water

472
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,040
to the plant itself

473
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,960
it is said that encouragement falls off easily

474
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,360
it breeds easily

475
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,640
Just now Vice President Wang also introduced

476
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,800
the rice seed

477
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,080
able to germinate in water

478
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,600
is a very special phenomenon

479
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,480
Including corn, wheat, barley, sorghum, etc.

480
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,800
those plants

481
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,560
Seeds cannot germinate in water

482
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,760
rice is ok

483
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,400
It has such characteristics

484
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,760
while our ancestors

485
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,880
Take advantage of this characteristic to grow rice

486
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,160
Because it can control weeds

487
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,880
Most other plants are not tolerant to flooding

488
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,680
So my rice is planted in water

489
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,800
i stand alone

490
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,160
no one competes with me

491
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,040
our ancestors

492
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,160
so why come to us

493
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
where are we now

494
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,700
grow rice

495
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,200
You can see the rice is still planted in this water

496
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,700
Weed control is a big reason

497
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,000
The main reason is not that rice really likes water

498
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,700
Water actually has some effect on root growth

499
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,300
So during certain growing periods

500
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,800
It makes the rice grow well

501
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,300
it drains the water

502
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,400
But usually it makes it flood

503
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,300
Because it can control weeds

504
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,000
This way you don't need to spend artificial weeding

505
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,200
Or sprinkle this weed spray

506
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,500
Because weed is expensive

507
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,300
Weed spray is the world's

508
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,500
In the chemicals used in agriculture

509
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,900
most

510
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,200
That rice has this benefit

511
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,900
But the disadvantage is that

512
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,900
You're going to go if you're so familiar with it.

513
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,700
you can really receive

514
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,800
there is not much to eat

515
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,300
So what about our taro seeds?

516
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,300
In the end it will be able to grow into this rice

517
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,900
Its bone grains are tightly combined with the rice fragments

518
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,100
not easy to drop

519
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,900
Then it's easy for us

520
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,400
Good for our harvest

521
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,100
Okay, what about Mr. Yu, for thousands of years

522
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,500
Going west is a very complicated process

523
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,200
Then we use this IR

524
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,300
The Philippine International Pirate Research Center

525
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,500
They yu come out IR 64

526
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,600
From this breed

527
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,400
we don't need much explanation

528
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,500
What does the eyebrows mean?

529
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,800
but he meant

530
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,400
he has many ancestors

531
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,200
Then each of these frames is an ancestor

532
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,800
his mother father

533
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,600
Then he goes to crossbred

534
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,200
After this is handed over to this

535
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,700
offspring with another

536
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,200
so don't pay

537
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,600
What about the hybridization process?

538
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,400
Elites will mutate

539
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,900
there will be missing

540
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,200
there will be reorganization

541
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,400
He keeps changing

542
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,400
So he later encountered these waterway species

543
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,400
With this ancestor all already have appearance above

544
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,300
Many agronomic traits above

545
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,300
have very different characteristics.

546
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,400
Therefore, Mr. Yu, a human being, has been

547
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,500
Constantly changing the elite of this plant

548
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,660
This particle is the taro seed of this wheat

549
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,700
The different strains of wheat it compares to each other

550
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,100
Sorry, this is Brosica

551
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,400
This is the cruciferous vegetable

552
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,840
In this particle, that is

553
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,040
If you AA this breed

554
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,300
Crossbreed with the BB breed

555
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,140
its offspring becomes ab

556
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:26,800
Then I mean cross BB with CC and it becomes BC

557
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,140
have such characteristics

558
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,380
So after crossing your chromosome

559
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,000
it will start to mix

560
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,480
what's more

561
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,880
Because our taro breeders also know that

562
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,480
increased number of chromosomes

563
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,180
These can often make your output come out of these

564
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,340
bone or fruit

565
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,600
its size will increase

566
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,000
So it figured out how to make its gene body bigger

567
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,100
Then it may be three different main lines

568
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,500
it just mixes it up

569
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,060
or the same genetic

570
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,200
it doubles it and triples it

571
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,600
All sorts of ways this genetics can be used to do

572
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,000
So what about wheat? What about current wheat?

573
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,800
What about its genetics?

574
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,000
It can have the shape of three sets of chromosomes like this

575
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,800
Then we just mentioned that

576
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,200
Corn is being bred and it's encouraged to grow bigger

577
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,400
why

578
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,600
That's because breeders know that

579
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,000
hybrid vigor

580
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,200
Then we humans are always like this

581
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,000
sometimes respectful breeding

582
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,600
You will feel that there may be some bad shape coming out

583
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,400
So the more distant genetics

584
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,600
If you are far away and come here to get married

585
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,200
It's possible to be smarter after having a baby

586
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,800
Said that when I was in high school

587
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Our relic teacher talks to us all day long

588
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,200
if you are taiwanese

589
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
You'd better marry someone from the Northeast in the future

590
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,400
Xinjiang people or something

591
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,800
Advocate with us all day long

592
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,800
Then he really insisted on genetic warfare

593
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
it may be possible

594
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,460
Can have offspring that will be better

595
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,440
So this can be seen

596
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,240
This corn, this A and B

597
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,940
It turns out that one may be the father and the other may be the mother.

598
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,240
After he crossed

599
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,740
No matter how you hand over the seeds of his offspring

600
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,140
become bigger

601
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,840
After the seeds grow bigger, after the encouragement grows bigger

602
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,540
The farmer's harvest began to increase

603
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,440
So what about this upgrade company?

604
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
He started selling the offspring

605
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
his offspring

606
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,200
It is really better if the offspring are encouraged.

607
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,400
But farmers can't breed by themselves

608
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,500
because after you reproduce yourself

609
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,300
What about his offspring?

610
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,600
Bad shape at the beginning will reappear

611
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,700
So what about this agricultural upgrading company in many international markets?

612
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,700
They're selling this hybrid seed

613
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,100
he makes money from it

614
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,300
He hybridized himself in the company

615
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,600
and sell the hybrid seed to farmers

616
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,200
Farmers breed themselves

617
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,800
This seed is getting worse

618
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,200
This is the characteristic of corn

619
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,520
Because it is required for heterosis

620
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,680
Then we usually grow rice by ourselves

621
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,240
Needless to say

622
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,520
I've been buying hybrid seeds

623
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,200
Because rice self-fertilizes

624
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,600
Its offspring can still grow well

625
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,480
but actually hybrid

626
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,200
even rice

627
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,960
Its hybrid still has an advantage

628
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,720
So on the mainland they are now

629
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,480
What about this hybrid rice?

630
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,720
is very popular now

631
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,440
Because the output increased so much

632
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,320
It can be increased by more than 20 to 30%

633
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,120
OK

634
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,320
so what about farmers

635
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,800
I have to deal with this biotech company

636
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,240
go buy this seed

637
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,840
Although more expensive

638
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,920
cost money

639
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,760
But because of its high yield

640
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,160
So what about the statistics?

641
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,240
I mean it came out in 1935

642
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,880
There is hybrid rice between 60 and

643
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,600
The hybrid rice planted by this farmer

644
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,960
The area is getting higher and higher

645
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,640
because it can make money

646
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,440
good

647
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,080
OK

648
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,340
Then let's come again, as mentioned earlier

649
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,460
Around 1960 to 2000

650
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,340
Our population has almost tripled

651
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,420
There is a very important reason for that

652
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,180
What about that period?

653
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,900
food has almost tripled

654
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,340
That great contribution is the two scholars

655
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,980
One is Noven Borla

656
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,100
The other one is our Academician Zhang Deci

657
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,940
What about Noven, he is the boss of wheat

658
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,100
Academician Zhang Deci is the chief executive who makes rice

659
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,580
Where's the time for their boss?

660
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,500
In fact, it was about that time

661
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,020
What a pity for this Westerner

662
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,420
always have an advantage in the comparison

663
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,780
they won the nobel prize

664
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,900
But what about Academician Zhang?

665
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,260
It's a pity I didn't get the Nobel Prize

666
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,700
So yesterday Ang Lee won the best director

667
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,740
He is also very emotional

668
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,500
We orientals often have a lot of actors

669
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,640
are very good

670
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,000
inside this boy pie

671
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,240
That indian guy really did a really good job

672
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,880
no awards were proposed

673
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,840
So the orientals are often at a disadvantage here

674
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,140
Academician Zhang is still a pity

675
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,700
Fortunately, there were many awards later.

676
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,540
Vatican Third World

677
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,940
Then this has something like this and finally has this

678
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,800
taylor award or something

679
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,800
In the end, they gave him a lot of honors.

680
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,100
ok, what about their type of bath?

681
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,440
The most important thing is that he made this wheat and corn

682
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,940
height reduction

683
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,000
height reduction

684
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,500
Why can the output be improved

685
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,440
First

686
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,300
when he grows too tall

687
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,000
is his nutrition

688
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,440
Much of his energy wasted on him

689
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,240
wasted in his constant vegetative reproduction

690
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,540
Then he won't understand

691
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,040
so you waste energy

692
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,640
so you don't let him be so high

693
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,240
It can use a lot of energy on the seeds

694
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,840
Besides, it's a little shorter

695
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,700
It will have more branches

696
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,000
Like rice and wheat

697
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,700
So its output will also increase

698
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,040
that in addition

699
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,000
In fact, the first green revolution

700
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,640
Except for this dwarf variety

701
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,240
the breed itself

702
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,700
Another feature is that

703
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,040
because we are doing

704
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,340
We all need to be wet and fat when we are doing crops

705
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,240
Especially egg fat is very much needed

706
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,040
can increase its output

707
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,640
But you are getting fatter

708
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,780
Rice is a plant that grows faster

709
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,640
higher

710
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,940
It's easy to fall like this

711
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,280
so you can see how tall it is

712
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,580
getting so short now

713
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,280
It's easier to fall

714
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,140
So what about after it is short?

715
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,980
You can fatten up a little more

716
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,040
So it can increase its output

717
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,880
So what about these two crops?

718
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,940
are very similar

719
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,140
very similar method

720
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,480
that's it

721
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,940
that's important

722
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,380
this in several countries

723
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,580
or an indian

724
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
This is a lot of people

725
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
The original food is not enough

726
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But he planted this

727
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
After half-milk wheat

728
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
In fact, after the crop dwarfs,

729
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Its disease resistance will also be improved

730
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
What about its output?

731
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
improved a lot

732
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Since it originally had to import food

733
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
become it able to output this food

734
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
so this is the first time

735
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
A very important contribution of the green revolution

736
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So is the rice

737
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So in this paragraph

738
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
The period from 1960 to 2000

739
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
double the population

740
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
From 3 billion to 6 billion

741
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Rice production is also

742
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You see this is double this

743
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
2 to 4 this

744
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
every year to every stew

745
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
The amount that can be produced per project

746
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Academician Zhang

747
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
what is he doing amazingly

748
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,600
This special waterway in Taiwan

749
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,400
low foot stain fried

750
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,600
take it to the philippines

751
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,000
Hybridized with this local waterway in the Philippines

752
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,440
pre-out this IR-8

753
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,600
IR-8

754
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,880
this rice

755
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,000
Known as Miracle Rice

756
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,440
because of its output

757
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,240
just make it double like this

758
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,280
So this one is very famous

759
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,040
This is a species of waterway

760
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,400
that's amazing

761
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,080
The whole world knows that it is from Taiwan

762
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,880
low foot stain fried

763
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,320
So also like our Director Ang Lee

764
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,080
Sell ​​Taiwan to countries all over the world

765
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,080
OK

766
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,120
So during this period of the Green Revolution

767
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,080
You can see that the population is actually increasing

768
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,120
it this

769
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,880
Different colors refer to different states

770
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,880
We can start by marking which state

771
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,560
Asia is the most

772
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,600
The population is increasing the most

773
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,420
The population increased by one hundred percent

774
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,380
Food has also increased by more than one hundred percent

775
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,760
But the cultivated area

776
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,960
In fact, you can see that the line is very slow

777
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,720
Is this right? It’s faster to climb uphill than this one.

778
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,000
this is very calm

779
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,580
It only increases the cultivated area by 20 percent

780
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:23,120
So it means the output of grain per unit area

781
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,000
increased very much

782
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,920
Then this is its species

783
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
great place

784
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,520
OK, let's finish this traditional breeding

785
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,800
let's talk

786
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,840
How does modern breeding work

787
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,720
What about modern molecular breeding?

788
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
allows us to increase efficiency

789
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,240
it combines molecular biology

790
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,680
and tissue culture

791
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,280
Then there's the part-time job

792
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,920
so breeding

793
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,840
It's not that modern technology

794
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,440
Tradition is gone

795
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,960
In fact, we still have to solve it now

796
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
together

797
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,800
We have produced many varieties in the laboratory

798
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,440
to plant in the field

799
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,600
still rely on many agronomists in the field

800
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,400
Specologists come and continue to help us

801
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,040
care for and reproduce these offspring

802
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,840
Then this technological progress

803
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,400
Advances in molecular biotechnology are very important

804
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,800
because each of us

805
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,000
including human animals or this crop

806
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,280
we have a genotype

807
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,200
That is to say, inside our chromosomes

808
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,440
have a lot of genes

809
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,040
So it will determine our phenotype

810
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,840
Decide what we'll look like when the time comes

811
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,440
So everyone's genes are a little bit different

812
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,240
So the length is not the same

813
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,880
but in

814
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,240
you have to tell

815
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,440
Which gene causes which phenotype

816
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,640
Genotype is relatively easy to use scientific methods to identify

817
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,600
Phenotyping is more difficult

818
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,800
because this

819
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
just say one parent

820
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,680
Just say a mom and dad

821
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,680
You know the baby you gave birth to

822
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,680
gave birth to three children five children

823
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,880
Everyone basically looks different

824
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,200
less likely to say exactly the same

825
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,800
besides being twins

826
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,040
So, genes are complicated

827
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,880
just a little difference

828
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,080
Then he's likely to come out with a different phenotype.

829
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,680
so we

830
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,120
but for us

831
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,720
we grow crops in the field

832
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,400
phenotype is important

833
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,040
I just need my good breed

834
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,720
looks like this

835
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,040
the output is so high

836
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,720
it is so delicious

837
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,440
and you

838
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,600
But your descendants are swollen and swollen

839
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,840
After his father and mother interbreed with his mother

840
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,360
how do i know who is good

841
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,320
who is bad

842
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,840
So what about molecular biology?

843
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,040
just let us

844
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,920
Help us do this breeding

845
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,000
Let's take an example

846
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,360
There is a variety of tomato

847
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,960
it is a very good variety

848
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,120
may have large fruit

849
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,320
high output

850
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,920
but it is not disease resistant

851
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,960
there's a bad breed in the wild

852
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,160
Or people don't pay much attention to his breed

853
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,160
He actually has a disease resistance gene

854
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,040
So our

855
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,040
his chromosomes

856
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,240
We now use different colors to represent

857
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,600
And this bad tomato

858
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,000
disease resistance gene

859
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,440
It's the yellow one

860
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,240
it's his genes

861
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,840
So what do we want to do with his good genes?

862
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,400
disease resistance gene

863
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,040
Lead to this excellent tomato variety

864
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,760
we are going to interbreed

865
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,080
What about after hybridization?

866
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,880
There will be many descendants

867
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,160
of various ages

868
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,800
then you don't know

869
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,480
Who is really carrying this disease resistance gene?

870
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,360
what about that

871
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,680
how to distinguish

872
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,440
But of course you have someone to say

873
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,080
When you are in the field, you vaccinate him.

874
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,000
Just sprinkle a bunch of sick bacteria on it.

875
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,520
and see who survives

876
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,480
But sometimes we don't like it

877
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,920
Because we are in the field

878
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,720
We're all terrified of these sick germs

879
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,200
You're going to scatter a bunch of sick germs down there again.

880
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,040
That patient's bacteria will never end in the future

881
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,000
So now there is a more scientific way to do

882
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
The most important thing is that after hybridization of this breed

883
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
its descendants

884
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,200
we can all say this

885
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,800
its different offspring

886
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,200
Some people have the gene of this father

887
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,600
disease resistance gene

888
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,200
there is no

889
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,400
Some have mother's genes

890
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,200
But you can see it has different combinations

891
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,200
So how do I tell who is good?

892
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,400
Then we're going to use this genetic marker to filter

893
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
This disease-resistant spider

894
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,000
the molecular biology approach

895
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,400
allows us to judge

896
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
every plant

897
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,800
who has our disease resistance genes

898
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,500
Then I put it with

899
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,400
this one good this one mom

900
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,800
or this species

901
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,200
We keep backcrossing and backcrossing

902
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Of course humans can't do that.

903
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,000
But plants can

904
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,900
We can go back and forth

905
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,000
take it this one

906
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,500
This gene from a bad breed

907
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,020
dilute until then

908
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,020
diluted to the end

909
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,520
Then only this disease resistance gene remains

910
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,020
Everything else is the gene of this good breed

911
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,520
so what

912
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,620
This is still using our current technology

913
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,620
This can now be accelerated

914
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,120
But when there was no such method before

915
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,120
A lot of them are really groping in the field.

916
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,620
So it takes a very long time

917
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,620
Likely five years, seven years, eight years, ten years

918
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,620
But now we are really at the time of everyone's food

919
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,620
Really need fear

920
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,620
Sometimes it feels like five or ten years is really a long wait

921
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,620
Then use the method now

922
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,620
About three to five years

923
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,620
A good variety can be predicted

924
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,620
much faster

925
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,620
That's why

926
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,620
But what about this molecular biology approach?

927
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,620
How can we

928
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,620
How about identifying its genotype?

929
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:58,620
We need to understand its entire genetic structure

930
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,620
So many works

931
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,240
like strawberry grapes, cotton, papaya

932
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,840
There are also jade mud, snow rice, soybeans like this

933
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,240
This rapeseed waits for many trees

934
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,840
Now its genes are slowly being unraveled

935
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,200
So we're doing this molecular bath

936
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,640
help will be great

937
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,520
OK, so this is a traditional bath swelling

938
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,120
Combining some techniques of modern molecular biology

939
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,680
But basically there's no genetic engineering involved

940
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,960
None of the stuff we just talked about has been genetically engineered.

941
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,560
But the method just mentioned

942
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,960
It still takes a little longer

943
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,400
That flower is still a bit more labor-intensive

944
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,160
So it's time to move on to this genetically engineered swelling technique

945
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,480
It can improve efficiency and accuracy

946
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,040
that's safer

947
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,960
We will talk about this later

948
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,160
As we said just now, there is this excellent tomato variety

949
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,500
That bad tomato variety has this disease-resistant gene.

950
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:15,320
Now our molecular biology only needs me to know what kind of gene this gene is

951
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,280
I have a way to copy it out

952
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,440
and insert it into this variety

953
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,400
At present, most people plug in at will.

954
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,400
But it doesn't matter as long as you don't destroy its original important genes

955
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,800
But technology is constantly improving

956
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,080
Now there are technologies that can be very accurate

957
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,440
Where am I on the chromosome

958
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,400
I want to insert it in that position

959
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,240
I know that location has the influence of this plant is the most

960
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,440
can do this now

961
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,200
So this is the genetic engineering method

962
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,040
It can do this very efficiently and accurately.

963
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,480
Because of our traditional method of hybridization

964
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,000
It will bring a lot of bad genes

965
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,400
So you have to keep crossing back

966
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,000
take a long time

967
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
But often in the end

968
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
still have a little gene

969
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
you can't help it maybe bad genes

970
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,500
not easy to rule it out

971
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Often there will still be such problems

972
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,000
But now we have a very precise method

973
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,500
You can avoid this problem by inserting

974
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,500
what's another advantage

975
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,000
We know that there are many types of this grain

976
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,500
From fruits, vegetables, bones, beans, etc.

977
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
there are so many different crops

978
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,500
In fact, there are often some genes

979
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,500
good genes like

980
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,500
As I just said, I am so watery that I have a gene for resistance to flooding

981
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,000
But other bone types are not submerged

982
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,500
Can I put my gene in corn

983
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,500
put in the wheat

984
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,500
no

985
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
because they can't fry

986
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,500
but we will know

987
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
what kind of gene is this

988
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
Can control this apricot after

989
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,000
I can turn water into the flood tolerance gene

990
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
do put

991
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,460
corn or wheat

992
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,700
That corn is more drought-resistant than baby corn

993
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,960
it can have a gene for drought resistance

994
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,900
we can put it in the waterway

995
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,100
Relying on traditional jade seed hybridization is not enough

996
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,000
Because different species can't interbreed

997
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,200
So I rely on the method of molecular biology

998
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,460
I can put the drought tolerance gene in corn

999
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,500
I put it in the waterway

1000
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,560
That doesn't matter

1001
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,360
Although people say that you are artificial

1002
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,200
You mix this gene like this

1003
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,100
Will there be any problems in nature

1004
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,760
Actually it's okay

1005
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,700
look at us

1006
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,800
Anyway, these grains are eaten in the stomach

1007
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,760
It's all mixed together, right?

1008
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,360
No matter where you came from

1009
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,000
So you are from wheat

1010
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,300
From corn to vegetables

1011
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,760
In our stomach

1012
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,760
There are a lot of different grains under finance

1013
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,260
It doesn't matter if it's mixed in the stomach

1014
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,760
More importantly, it will be digested at all

1015
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,100
no matter what food you eat

1016
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,360
it digests you absorb it

1017
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,420
So this gene of this different species

1018
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,800
It's actually a good thing to exchange like this

1019
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,860
That is also true for this natural world

1020
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,500
It doesn't matter too much.

1021
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,360
As we said earlier

1022
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,760
The human race is already a lot of genes

1023
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,260
I've been messing around like this

1024
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,260
OK let's give an example

1025
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,860
with this genetic engineering method

1026
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,660
what can we do

1027
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,660
in africa

1028
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,660
This bacterial tail vulture disease

1029
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,660
is very serious

1030
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,960
Farmers often don't get the bananas

1031
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,760
Bananas in countries like Africa

1032
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,260
is an important food crop

1033
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,260
If so

1034
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,760
I was already short of food

1035
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
That's going to make me hungry

1036
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,060
What about the bacteria?

1037
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,160
After you cut the fungus

1038
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,360
you can see

1039
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,560
stay with this sticky thing

1040
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,460
this is bacteria

1041
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,360
So it's a terrible disease

1042
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,560
no good treatment

1043
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,160
Traditional encounters are also very limited

1044
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,400
But now I know that green peppers contain

1045
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,360
there is this chili inside

1046
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,840
There is a gene that is resistant to this disease

1047
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
So put it in this banana

1048
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,440
Look no, then go get vaccinated

1049
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,000
Of course, this is done in a laboratory or a greenhouse.

1050
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,200
It turns out that once you are vaccinated with this species, you are sightseeing.

1051
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:25,040
But this one has the gene from the pepper

1052
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,560
it can grow well

1053
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,360
So this is a great one for genetic engineering

1054
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,920
a contribution

1055
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,600
so now in africa

1056
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,320
Bananas like this have already started

1057
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,120
They are evaluating whether it is possible for farmers to plant

1058
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,960
Another example

1059
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,920
It is an antibacterial virus using this thule bacteria

1060
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,960
antimicrobial protein we should talk about antimicrobial protein

1061
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,400
Suriella is a bacterium

1062
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,880
In fact it is in our

1063
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
It has been used in agriculture for a long time

1064
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,000
It has been used for decades

1065
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,520
because it kills a lot of that

1066
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,520
Insects like this

1067
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,800
Insects like many oysters and butterflies

1068
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,480
will harm the forest

1069
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,560
What about in the forest?

1070
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,000
You're less likely to get sprayed sometimes

1071
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,200
Because the cost is too high

1072
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,000
and sometimes limited

1073
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,280
that could hurt a lot

1074
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,120
the hesitant animals

1075
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,880
So Suriella is used in this forest

1076
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,760
I used to be a biological house

1077
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,360
It's been a long time

1078
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,880
Then people who grow organic vegetables now

1079
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,520
Actually used a lot

1080
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,720
he is on top of his vegetables

1081
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,080
on top of the fruits and vegetables

1082
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,720
He still kills Suriella

1083
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,320
Really ask this organic heavier person to know

1084
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,600
Those biotech companies

1085
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,440
They took a gene in this suri bacterium

1086
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,200
this gene it is to a

1087
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,000
insect-resistant protein

1088
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,760
it puts it in this corn

1089
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,600
you can see this corn

1090
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,140
Without doing genetic engineering like this

1091
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,840
This insect is very powerful

1092
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,240
It's easy to destroy this corn just like that

1093
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,600
it just takes a few bites

1094
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:17,380
Farmers can't sell

1095
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,740
OK

1096
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,480
so what

1097
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,080
The protein produced by this green machine

1098
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,780
what kind of protein

1099
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,860
it this is its bacteria

1100
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,120
visible under a microscope

1101
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,220
Seen under a high powered microscope

1102
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,620
traditional method

1103
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,660
You just put this threophyte

1104
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,460
sprinkled on the surface of the leaves

1105
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,960
current genetic engineering methods

1106
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:44,400
is to let the plant itself produce this protein

1107
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,700
insects eat

1108
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,440
eat into the stomach

1109
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,880
either way

1110
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,040
it eats into the stomach

1111
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,480
the insect

1112
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,220
Insects like Lin Akagi

1113
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,220
There are some skinny in its stomach

1114
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,960
Its body will bind to this protein

1115
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,800
Then its stomach will be perforated by it

1116
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,800
So the insect's stomach and intestines are perforated

1117
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,040
so why does this insect die

1118
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,160
Then its life body is a very special life body

1119
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,240
not all insects have

1120
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,600
Mainly because of the red wood insects

1121
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,000
Then our people will not have such a life

1122
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,600
So it's harmless to people

1123
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,600
So why biocontrol

1124
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,000
the reason it takes so long

1125
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,600
So those biotech companies

1126
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,600
It puts this gene into this plant

1127
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,960
let it produce itself

1128
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,800
That way you don't have to spray

1129
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,440
Because if you spray it, you still need to feed the bacteria

1130
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,240
Then you have to spray it manually

1131
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,600
It takes energy and manpower

1132
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,960
Then another one has a potential problem

1133
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,160
Many people like organic vegetables and think they are safe

1134
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,960
Just wash and wash

1135
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,680
In fact, there may be a lot of bacteria still attached to it.

1136
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,120
because of U.S

1137
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,800
We usually cook this food

1138
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,400
in order to be able to truly completely sterilize

1139
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,500
So sometimes you spray the bacteria directly

1140
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,400
not necessarily a good thing

1141
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,400
But this protein

1142
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,400
This is proved by experiments

1143
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,100
It is low enough that it is not harmful to humans

1144
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,400
But it's enough to kill the insect

1145
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,800
So this product in this genetic engineering

1146
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,700
to be listed

1147
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,400
So it was very successful on corn

1148
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,240
This genetic modification of us is called a gene

1149
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,900
Corn is not genetic

1150
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,000
This is the blade just is it's into the blade

1151
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,600
Then wrap it in this broken piece

1152
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,600
for farmers

1153
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,200
It is really expensive to buy this seed

1154
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,800
but its harvest is good

1155
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Okay so that means he can make money

1156
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So why actually plant this genetically engineered plant like this

1157
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
The country of these products

1158
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
In fact, more and more farmers

1159
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
we'll come back later

1160
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
what good does he do

1161
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Like this one that itself will resist insects

1162
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
What are the benefits of genetic crops

1163
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Then there are many people who say

1164
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
especially environmental groups

1165
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I have always been very opposed to a product like this

1166
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
But this is in Australia

1167
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
They were in 1993 and 1994

1168
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I think he is starting to do

1169
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
This dotted line is the genetic cotton

1170
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
He started in 1996 and 1997 to 2002 and 2003

1171
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
During the 56 years

1172
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
He went to see the amount of pesticide used

1173
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
So to achieve this one is the traditional cotton

1174
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
The following is genetic cotton

1175
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,160
Its usage is reduced by one-third to one-half

1176
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,720
This is a very significant difference

1177
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,000
It's just Australia

1178
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,920
In fact, there are many countries in the world

1179
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,440
a lot of crops

1180
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,280
These are the crops now

1181
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,720
Think about how much that pesticide can be reduced

1182
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,480
OK this is cotton

1183
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,040
And then there are often people who object to memories

1184
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,360
He said this is for those in the field

1185
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,520
Intentional insects are socially harmful

1186
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,280
because a deliberate insect is likely to eat you this

1187
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,640
Resistant corn

1188
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,880
cotton or this soybean

1189
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,720
This intentional insect will die

1190
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,360
So this experiment was done in mainland China

1191
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,320
He did it for ten years

1192
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,240
2001 to 2011

1193
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,200
Then he went to see the toothworm's natural enemy

1194
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,040
So his natural enemy is the zerg

1195
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,880
What kind of whore, grass spirit?

1196
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,240
Then this spider waits

1197
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,960
What about the red line?

1198
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,100
The blue line is Gm has produced Bt

1199
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,900
Bt is the protein that fights insects

1200
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,840
This blue thread is Bt cotton

1201
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,000
The red is non-Bt cotton

1202
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,040
You can look at the trees of its predators

1203
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,340
in different years

1204
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,240
its to overlap

1205
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,800
The curves all overlap

1206
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:26,160
So the trees that say it's intentional insects are the same

1207
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,760
But this green one is the cotton of Bt Aircraft Flame

1208
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,400
It's going to spray this sand bug spray

1209
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,120
so this blue this is no sandblast

1210
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,220
But but you don't have sand spray

1211
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,120
It's cotton is probably also harvested

1212
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:44,420
Because the insects probably ate it up

1213
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,160
But the machine flame is that it can resist insects

1214
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,300
it doesn't need to be sprayed

1215
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,800
Then it farmers can also have a harvest

1216
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,320
But if the plane is in flames, you go spray sand insecticide

1217
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,520
Although sandworms can

1218
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,380
But you can see the trees of its intentional insects are greatly reduced

1219
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,360
The number of crab worms and tooth worms

1220
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,880
You can see this non-myositic cotton

1221
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,800
hacking insecticide

1222
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,120
It has so many toothworms

1223
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,800
And this BT cotton or non-BT cotton

1224
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,600
It's not sprayed

1225
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,560
Its number of toothworms is very small

1226
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,200
so that means

1227
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,600
It reduces the number of intentional insects

1228
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,520
But crab worms increase

1229
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,400
In this non-BT this cotton

1230
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,200
in the case of pesticides

1231
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,200
so it's not just cotton

1232
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,400
It's drizzled with some corn peanuts soy and all

1233
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,480
both also benefit

1234
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,240
Because of the many toothworms it's

1235
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,520
its this

1236
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,440
Ancestor worship is very wide

1237
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,440
it likes to eat many different crops

1238
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,760
So it drenches some

1239
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,120
That other crops also benefit

1240
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,160
So this was published last year on

1241
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,920
An article in Nature

1242
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,320
good

1243
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,600
This we mentioned the crop of these experiences

1244
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:08,700
To be honest, it doesn't seem to have any impact on the environment.

1245
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,800
ok , then we will mention this again

1246
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,300
The issue we are concerned with is that

1247
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,600
The Gauge Challenges We Are Facing Now

1248
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,800
is how to produce enough food

1249
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,800
Come to remit a population of 9 billion

1250
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,200
this was just mentioned

1251
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,100
The population is now increasing at a rate that is rocketing upwards

1252
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,200
The various activities of our human beings

1253
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,200
for standard of living

1254
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,400
Then use the car

1255
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,600
Then this uses a lot of machinery

1256
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,200
wait a lot of carbon dioxide

1257
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,300
So it's this warming

1258
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,100
Also this keeps increasing

1259
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:50,200
How can we do this without damaging the environment

1260
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,200
It can also remit the global population

1261
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,100
it's a big challenge

1262
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,100
can we not use robotic hands

1263
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,800
use people to follow

1264
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,900
It seems very difficult, labor is very expensive now

1265
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Our oil is also expensive

1266
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,960
Harvest now with this machine

1267
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,760
Then carbon dioxide was produced

1268
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,320
is that possible

1269
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,560
no pesticides

1270
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,520
Because pesticides are not good for the environment

1271
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,600
that won't work

1272
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,480
You can't harvest this

1273
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,320
but the man in the organic suit

1274
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,720
This guy who promotes organic food

1275
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,760
He said yes, we can produce

1276
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,600
We just don't use pesticides

1277
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,800
But the problem is that the cost is very high

1278
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,560
Why

1279
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,000
Because you have to use a lot of labor

1280
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
to catch bugs

1281
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,000
to prevent

1282
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,960
that's hard to mass produce

1283
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,640
its cost is high

1284
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,360
So this environment does not destroy

1285
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,560
It is a dilemma to increase food

1286
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,520
is a big challenge

1287
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,520
Then what's another question

1288
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,920
global land crisis

1289
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,000
Because our arable land area is actually getting smaller and smaller

1290
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,080
because of industrial development

1291
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,160
There are many chemical pollution

1292
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,400
Industry brings a lot of chemicals

1293
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,960
abnormal weather, floods, sweat disasters, etc.

1294
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,760
Then you can see that there are actually many land

1295
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,560
Constantly researching why

1296
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,840
Because we use a lot of fertilizer

1297
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,520
Many fertilizers are useless

1298
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,040
no plant no absorption

1299
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,920
Then all combined on this soil

1300
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,480
Then you have no water and no water

1301
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,520
Originally, the water could wash away a lot of fertilizers.

1302
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,960
but it lacks water

1303
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,160
So all the crystals stay in the soil

1304
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,120
In the case of serious research

1305
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,240
This plant can't grow anymore

1306
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,280
You can see you are crying to death

1307
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,800
Then desertification is the consequence of water shortage

1308
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,160
Many countries have this problem

1309
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,240
Mainland This is the northern part of mainland China

1310
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,000
it lacks water and then deserts

1311
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,680
so they're going to plant grass

1312
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,240
plant it with grass

1313
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,520
hope to reduce this one

1314
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,560
were able

1315
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:53,080
But there is a big problem, the sand leopard

1316
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,920
Every year the dust leopard

1317
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,680
It is because of the problem of desertification

1318
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
This population has increased

1319
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,700
We already want to increase production and increase food production

1320
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,060
Land can be heavier and less and less

1321
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:08,940
what to do

1322
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,560
When it comes to food, we must mention rice

1323
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,740
Because rice is in all kinds of grains

1324
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,240
inside the main food

1325
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,240
It is 50% of the world's population

1326
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,640
a staple food

1327
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,740
Corn is the highest in terms of yield

1328
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:31,580
This is corn that is usually fed to our raw vinegar

1329
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,580
Cows, pigs, sheep, etc.

1330
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:38,380
So the real people eat mainly rice and wheat

1331
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:42,080
Rice is the most important grain

1332
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,580
ok so what

1333
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:47,380
Since so many people eat rice

1334
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:50,540
If you can increase the rice production

1335
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:53,840
The importance of its impact like this

1336
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,340
It can be shown

1337
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:00,340
The global food

1338
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Because every country actually has a safety stock

1339
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
There will be anything from three months to six months

1340
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Or more than half a year, one or two years

1341
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Different countries have different ways of doing this

1342
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
But let's look at the wheat, jade and soybeans

1343
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:21,000
The period from 1975 to this 2016

1344
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Of course it's not that time yet

1345
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It's about 2005 now

1346
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Its statistics are up to that time

1347
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
You can see it this safety stock

1348
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
These three very important crops

1349
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Because wheat is originally eaten

1350
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
This jade is eaten by animals

1351
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Soybeans are eaten by both humans and animals

1352
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Its safety stock has actually been at its lowest point all the time.

1353
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And it's jade mushroom

1354
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Jade mushroom will still be very low

1355
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
what about the rice

1356
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
In several major rice producing countries

1357
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Like China, India and other countries

1358
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Many countries in Southeast Asia

1359
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,540
its safe food

1360
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:05,880
By 2007, this statistic had dropped to a very low level.

1361
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,960
In fact, it is still decreasing and not increasing

1362
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:11,780
so what about this problem

1363
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,080
If some catastrophes suddenly come

1364
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,380
you can't produce enough food

1365
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,920
You don't have enough food

1366
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,720
like deposits in our bank

1367
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,520
If you save less than you use

1368
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,620
Your bank balance will be gone in no time.

1369
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,620
OK

1370
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,720
what else is there

1371
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,540
the price of oil

1372
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,320
on the rise

1373
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,120
What about the fertilizer?

1374
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,920
The most important thing is egg fertilizer like urea

1375
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,500
Because heavy crops must use a lot of egg fertilizer

1376
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,520
that egg fat

1377
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,820
it consumes a lot of energy

1378
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,880
So when the price of oil goes up

1379
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,660
The price of urea will follow

1380
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:52,220
So can see it this price increase

1381
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:55,040
Then the price of this rice

1382
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,780
Of course it also rises

1383
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,320
because you're going to use fertilizer again

1384
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,120
So farming needs oil

1385
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
so what about this question

1386
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,660
In fact, there is no good solution

1387
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:09,160
Besides these problems

1388
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,660
It's even worse if you add natural disasters

1389
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:15,320
Look at this Thailand in 2011

1390
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,820
we probably still have the impression

1391
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:20,620
Its whole country was flooded with a set of lake soil

1392
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,620
This is the point to come to this satellite

1393
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,120
it this country

1394
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,520
then flooded

1395
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,120
flooded this wide range

1396
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,880
Then you see even this aircraft factory is flooded

1397
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,080
so what year

1398
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,080
this is 2011

1399
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,880
You can look at the international food prices

1400
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,880
From this January to December

1401
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,380
You can see that the price of food has risen

1402
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,380
Of course later

1403
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,880
sometimes there is a follow up

1404
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,880
There will be food produced again

1405
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:48,880
But what?

1406
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,880
can clearly see

1407
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,580
As long as there is such a natural disaster

1408
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,580
It is the main food production

1409
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:57,880
The price of its food will definitely rise

1410
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,880
It's not just Thailand

1411
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,600
something like this is happening

1412
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,720
America in 2008

1413
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,320
Major flooding in Midwest cornfields

1414
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,160
this is its cornfield

1415
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,040
You can't see the smoke from the corn

1416
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,040
This is the system it irrigates

1417
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,720
Of course this would cause a great loss

1418
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,240
same place

1419
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,120
Last year it was sweat disaster

1420
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,880
severe sweating

1421
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,480
large flakes of corn wheat

1422
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,040
The soybeans are all dried out like this

1423
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,640
so the same place

1424
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,320
can have such an extreme climate

1425
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,760
to have a problem like this

1426
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,600
The entire country of the United States at that time last year

1427
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,080
sweaty place

1428
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,680
the darker it is

1429
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,720
That is, the more it dries up, the more serious it is.

1430
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,240
its serious

1431
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:58,000
almost in its crop yield

1432
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,400
highest area

1433
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,020
in this generation

1434
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,600
what was the consequence of that

1435
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,140
can be seen

1436
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,940
last year

1437
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,000
Many newspapers often write

1438
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:13,320
The price of corn has gone up

1439
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,380
Then you can see what soybeans

1440
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,160
up what 30

1441
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:23,300
Will want 39% corn 52% wheat 37%

1442
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,340
Gold Treasury 9%

1443
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,700
Then oil 16% and so on

1444
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,100
It's just been rising. Everyone is very concerned about this issue.

1445
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,960
Everyone goes out to eat, especially the students, it's very pitiful. I don't have much money.

1446
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:41,260
Eating out is getting more and more expensive

1447
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,600
I experimented with cadavers eating this a few weeks ago

1448
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:45,620
Pizza huh

1449
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,660
I haven't invited them for a long time

1450
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,720
so i asked my assistant and i said

1451
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,760
I buy all of these big Songda

1452
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:52,780
say how much

1453
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,840
He said more than 700 yuan, I said

1454
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,880
I thought it was still more than 400 yuan

1455
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,900
I'm sorry I haven't invited them to eat for a long time

1456
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
But it's really long

1457
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,000
You can see that not only the United States but also Australia

1458
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Australia is already suffering from frequent droughts

1459
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Australia actually produces a lot of wheat and barley

1460
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
is a very important granary

1461
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
It is also suffering from this drought now

1462
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Worse is predicted by 2050

1463
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
We all like to use 2050 as an indicator now

1464
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
How much does the population increase

1465
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
will increase from the current 7 billion to 9 billion

1466
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
more than 9 billion

1467
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
But you can see where it's dry

1468
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
This is also the darker the color, the more severe the drought

1469
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Many countries will have this drought

1470
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
look at this america

1471
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
and this south america

1472
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Africa

1473
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Europe

1474
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Asia

1475
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
the problem of drought

1476
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,300
is seriously global

1477
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,460
Then we also have problems in Taiwan

1478
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,200
Although we in Taiwan seem to be more redundant

1479
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,000
Even on the street, there are often some problems

1480
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
The most important thing is what problems are happening to us now

1481
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I'm sorry, how do I focus by myself?

1482
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,400
OK Rice Cut Production

1483
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:23,400
You can see our root pruning from 1981 on this

1484
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,800
So our rice crops are up to

1485
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,800
This is the statistics until 2009

1486
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,800
its cut

1487
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,600
cut a lot

1488
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,400
more than two and a half times

1489
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,400
What about self-cultivation of food?

1490
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,200
just follow up

1491
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,700
Now the current food self-reliance is 32%

1492
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:42,600
it means

1493
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:46,500
Our own Taiwan is very suitable for rice production

1494
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,100
we produce now

1495
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,700
To be able to produce the mother-in-law to rely on rice

1496
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,800
It's probably just like this now

1497
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,600
about 30%

1498
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,600
what is the other 70%

1499
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,100
It's imported

1500
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,000
imported corn wheat

1501
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
soybeans

1502
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,000
It has a lot of pesticides and fertilizers

1503
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:03,960
and oil

1504
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,000
that kind

1505
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,560
It all depends on foreign countries

1506
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,800
Then our own food production is so little

1507
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,000
Then there are many small farmers in Taiwan

1508
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,800
you see most of this

1509
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,560
In fact, more than two-thirds

1510
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,760
All this one-hectare smallholders

1511
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,160
cost increases

1512
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,000
Plus we have a lot of this

1513
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,560
There are a lot of this luxurious farmhouse in this field

1514
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,760
luxury farmers

1515
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,920
Go to Nikan, Yilan after Chinese New Year

1516
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:35,360
I really saw a lot of what is called a house

1517
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,560
Plant them in a kennel from the start

1518
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,200
A lot of this, a small room, a small room in the field

1519
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,680
It's really a serious problem

1520
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,760
let's go to that america

1521
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,760
not just America you don't look at America

1522
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,760
america is too big

1523
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,120
then we go to what

1524
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,080
France United Kingdom Some countries

1525
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,080
Japanese Korean family

1526
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,880
The place where it is made is a kind of kennel

1527
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,520
there are no pounds in it

1528
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,880
People live together in a village

1529
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:08,280
Only Taiwan is really a house with this

1530
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,840
smashed together first

1531
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,400
Is it for the high-speed rail or the Taiwan Railway?

1532
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,840
You can see such problems

1533
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,480
So this will increase its production cost

1534
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,960
OK, let's talk again.

1535
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,840
We are now targeting this grain

1536
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,440
What kind of goals do we have

1537
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,440
Although there are many problems, we still have to do

1538
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,400
first very important

1539
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,560
Increase production

1540
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,160
Right, we said the population is increasing so fast

1541
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,200
Yield is really the number one priority

1542
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,600
we can take a look

1543
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:49,040
This global statistic

1544
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,880
From 74 to 2009

1545
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,640
Around the time of the Green Revolution

1546
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,040
Corn, Rice, Wheat, Rapeseed

1547
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,040
Both increased by 1.5 to 2.0%

1548
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
that's all

1549
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:04,500
So PETA has increased a lot during this period of time

1550
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:06,660
But what?

1551
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,240
Many other things are also increasing in price

1552
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,940
This is American corn

1553
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:14,240
Take this corn from IOWA as an example

1554
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,040
corn it increased by 1.6 times

1555
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,040
But what?

1556
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,640
These cost three times the machinery

1557
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,600
Four times the seed pesticide fertilizer

1558
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,700
artificial quadruple

1559
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:25,800
land seven times in three years

1560
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,640
Add up all kinds

1561
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,540
It costs ten times as much to produce as it produces

1562
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,200
Therefore, although production increases

1563
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,240
But we're raising prices on everything

1564
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,800
So everyone needs enough food besides now

1565
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,200
Have enough money to buy food

1566
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,900
So this is a double question

1567
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:49,840
That

1568
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:52,700
Although it is said that in 2020

1569
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:56,040
In 2000, our entire period from 1960 to 2020

1570
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,100
Double our production

1571
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,900
But as you can see in the recent

1572
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
In the past 20 years, his growth rate has actually slowed down.

1573
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
This is reflected in India, Asia, China

1574
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
His growth rate has actually slowed down.

1575
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
There is no way to go as fast as before

1576
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
So to increase the yield of this crop

1577
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
what are we going to do

1578
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
For a reflection

1579
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
it has to grow well

1580
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
It has two very important conditions

1581
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
one is environmental factors

1582
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
like sunshine, rain

1583
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Another is the genetic factor

1584
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Environmental factors are

1585
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
no drought

1586
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Not too much salt, accumulation, low temperature, high temperature

1587
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
no floods etc.

1588
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
another biological way

1589
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
It means serious illness, current weight, etc.

1590
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
These have to be prevented

1591
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
additional genetic factors

1592
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
that is how to make it

1593
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Its shape is the best

1594
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Photosynthesis is the most efficient

1595
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,600
The amount of encouragement it rises is the largest and the heaviest

1596
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,200
and its roots

1597
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,320
It can also absorb water and nutrients

1598
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,600
the effect is the best

1599
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:13,400
Wait, there are very, very many of these conditions

1600
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,560
work together to be able

1601
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:18,600
There is a most perfect one rice

1602
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,200
give you the best yield

1603
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,200
right

1604
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,560
not so easy

1605
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,600
but now this

1606
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,560
We who did this rice research

1607
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:27,600
have been working hard

1608
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,400
I hope you can

1609
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,200
Explore this issue from different angles

1610
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,000
Finally these good features

1611
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,400
They are all concentrated in this registration.

1612
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,000
that probably

1613
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
methods of genetic engineering

1614
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
It may be a more important method

1615
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,200
because in a short time

1616
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,000
to achieve that

1617
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,800
In addition to production

1618
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:54,200
There is another very important thing to improve

1619
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,600
Just look at the drought

1620
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:56,800
i just mentioned

1621
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,200
This drought is actually a serious problem

1622
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,000
because of you

1623
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,160
Very sick you always still have pesticides

1624
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,760
But you have no rain

1625
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,560
no water is no water

1626
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:11,360
It is difficult to prevent

1627
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,880
It won't be easy unless I disturb artificial rain tomorrow

1628
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,040
So this tough question

1629
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:19,520
It is very important for our breeding to solve

1630
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,040
that crop

1631
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,360
There is a big problem is

1632
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,120
it really has a lot of water

1633
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,480
daily food for each of us

1634
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:32,440
The food needed needs 3,000 liters, etc.

1635
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,240
Waiting for three tons of water to plant us every day

1636
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,480
the grain needed

1637
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,720
You can see 70 percent of the world's fresh water

1638
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,200
used on crops

1639
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,240
that this one

1640
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:48,680
Sorry, could it be pesticides?

1641
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,000
is agriculture

1642
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,040
Most praised on agriculture

1643
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,640
Then industrial household water

1644
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:58,560
So agricultural production really uses a lot of water

1645
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,920
Let's be brave and don't let it

1646
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,400
use so much water

1647
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,200
What about planting rice like this?

1648
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,600
An average kilogram of rice

1649
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,520
It also uses 2.5 tons

1650
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,960
2500 liters of this water

1651
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,640
the world probably

1652
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,400
nearly one-third of the water

1653
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,080
It is used for rice irrigation

1654
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,480
that other rice

1655
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:22,440
In addition to the evaporation of water from the leaves

1656
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,280
The largest part is the surface of the water

1657
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,520
Surface water in the field

1658
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,680
just evaporate

1659
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:32,240
Of course some of it will seep a little below the ground.

1660
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:36,400
But its evaporation from the surface is a serious problem

1661
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,000
So can we use less water to grow rice?

1662
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,400
Can you stop soaking in water all the time?

1663
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,160
Of course we just mentioned that

1664
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:48,920
Yes weed control is an important reason

1665
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,480
But in fact, there are many heavier methods

1666
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:55,160
can actually assist in reducing this weed problem

1667
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,640
The water in Taiwan is the same

1668
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,360
That's about three quarters of water

1669
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
used in this agriculture

1670
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:05,000
But we also often have this problem of water shortage.

1671
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,940
Sometimes when there is a lack of water

1672
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,280
like the recent south central

1673
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:10,340
Although it rains a lot in Taipei

1674
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,640
During the Chinese New Year, everyone is very happy to go to South Central

1675
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:14,240
The weather is very good in the south-central

1676
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,280
Probably Taipei is very boring, the teacher is raining

1677
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,120
But people in Taipei are actually lucky

1678
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:20,080
Because there is almost no shortage of water in Taipei

1679
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:22,560
Our Bandit Reservoir has always been difficult

1680
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:25,860
However, the central and southern regions are often in this period of winter

1681
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:26,860
go really short of water

1682
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,360
Because there is no typhoon

1683
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:32,160
So if it's too severe

1684
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:35,000
Farmers don't plant rice after spring

1685
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:37,460
The government began to say that there is a shortage of water

1686
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,500
We are going to use water in industry

1687
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,700
Farmers don't farm

1688
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,880
So this is actually a regular

1689
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,540
It must happen every few years

1690
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,440
Then the peasants are poor

1691
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:52,620
often forget the state of mind

1692
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:55,020
For farmers, although the government subsidizes

1693
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,620
hardworking farmer

1694
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,220
he doesn't like watching this too much

1695
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,360
Change this field back home

1696
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
over there

1697
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,600
OK, except that Taiwan has such a problem

1698
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,900
Africa is also a serious problem

1699
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,800
Africa also grows a lot of corn

1700
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,800
is their main food

1701
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,600
But this corn is also very sensitive to dry welding

1702
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,800
The darker the country

1703
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:23,400
It means that it can have an irrigation system

1704
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,800
is more sufficient

1705
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,500
Are these colors faded?

1706
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,100
It is a place that lacks water

1707
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:34,000
So water scarcity is a serious problem in Africa

1708
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,940
by 2020

1709
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:38,100
predicted to be more serious

1710
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:39,420
and may

1711
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,700
Corn production will be reduced by 50%

1712
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:43,500
what to do

1713
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,900
Its population growth is also one of the fastest in the region

1714
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,200
outside of asia

1715
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,900
Then cut it in half

1716
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,800
OK, except what we just said

1717
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,300
The purpose of forecasting is to increase production

1718
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:00,000
and sweat resistant

1719
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,760
In fact, we also hope to improve crops

1720
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,520
Can you make this food more nutritious?

1721
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,160
can be good for our health

1722
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,080
So this in our research

1723
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,720
Or many people have done a lot in other research

1724
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,160
Then let's take an example

1725
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:22,400
Our genetic engineering is to increase the nutrition of food

1726
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,520
what can be done

1727
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:27,280
That's beta carotene

1728
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,320
that is to say let this one

1729
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,240
Hope to be able to predict that crop?

1730
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,320
It contains beta carotene

1731
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,240
because most crops

1732
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,360
Amount of Beta Carotene Contained

1733
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,680
Too much is not enough

1734
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,080
that this is the world

1735
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:47,600
caused by vitamin A deficiency

1736
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,480
This night mango shrimp eye

1737
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,120
Shrimp eyes are vitamin A deficiency

1738
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,600
is a major reason

1739
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,640
The green one is fine.

1740
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,720
in this brain

1741
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,920
Can get enough vitamin A or betavenous waves

1742
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,560
But these countries

1743
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,560
what about the yellow

1744
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,560
The yellow one is already common

1745
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,880
that red one is very bad

1746
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,480
so what

1747
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,980
There are many countries in this

1748
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:18,640
Actually more or less

1749
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,480
will have some of this

1750
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,480
vitamin deficiency problem

1751
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:26,080
Many pregnant women are also deficient in vitamin A

1752
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,800
Then this miscarriage

1753
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,600
Then the kid talks nonsense

1754
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,600
then many die

1755
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,000
so in this

1756
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,880
beta carrot tree

1757
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,040
he is

1758
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,600
What about the topic we want to talk about?

1759
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,080
He put it in this rice

1760
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,520
that's because he turned golden

1761
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,200
We know that beta carrot trees are yellow

1762
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,720
so when yellow

1763
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,200
he called me golden rice

1764
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,840
What about the rice?

1765
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:00,440
Inside he has a right of this beta carrot tree

1766
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,600
meaning that if it can go through some process

1767
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:05,880
some genes exist

1768
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,880
through a process

1769
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,980
beta carotene

1770
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:12,480
But rice itself does not have these enzymes

1771
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,280
So it has the original precursor empty

1772
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,080
But there is no way to convert it into beta carotene

1773
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,280
beta carotene

1774
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,080
If we eat in the body

1775
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,480
it can be converted into vitamin A

1776
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,780
So this scientist

1777
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,880
Humane

1778
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,880
He hoped that the rice could be produced

1779
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:35,320
Because rice is actually the staple food of 50% of the population

1780
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:38,280
Especially many people in this relatively weak or region

1781
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:39,720
Eat rice as the staple food

1782
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:41,820
If you can let him eat the rice

1783
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,360
There is this vitamin beta carrot

1784
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,080
If the plain skin is converted into beta life A

1785
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:48,860
Many of the problems we just mentioned can be solved

1786
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:53,260
So this technique was published in Science in 2000

1787
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:56,160
is a very sensational one thing

1788
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:59,540
Because it's the first time to do this in a plant

1789
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,800
Genetic engineering alters its metabolic pathways

1790
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:07,200
Make it possible to generate this Beta Robb tree

1791
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:10,400
Later this technique was also used in other vegetables

1792
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,800
corn top

1793
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,600
The corn used to look yellow

1794
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,600
Actually it's not a Beta Robin tree

1795
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:19,200
So they put it in this corn too

1796
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,600
Then come to predict this breed Mr.

1797
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,200
this is the gentleman

1798
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,200
The Ingeborg Park in Sweden

1799
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,600
that's his collaborator

1800
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,400
Peter Bayer

1801
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:35,200
He published this report in 2000

1802
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,800
The day I just talked about Science

1803
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:37,800
very sensational

1804
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:41,200
But at that time a two-year-old child

1805
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:45,000
To eat three kilograms of golden rice

1806
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:47,800
To be able to get enough Beta Robb trees

1807
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,700
So this environmental protection group keeps canceling him.

1808
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,500
So it's useless to you

1809
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:55,100
How is it possible that a child only weighs three kilograms a day

1810
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:56,400
that's all eaten up

1811
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,000
Can't get enough of this beta robin tree

1812
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,800
so wait he waited 10 years

1813
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,960
Around 2001 he retired

1814
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,160
Golden Girl still has no way to promote

1815
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,280
But in the process he kept improving

1816
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,160
In 2005

1817
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,960
72 grams children eat 72 grams per day

1818
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,960
Just a small handful and a small bowl

1819
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,960
will be able to get enough of the golden girl

1820
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:26,640
He's retired

1821
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,520
Now only his collaborator Peter Bayer

1822
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,840
continue his efforts

1823
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:35,200
In this Philippine International Year of Rice is the center

1824
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:38,720
They are now constantly promoting this technology

1825
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,600
Because different regions of the world

1826
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,560
Different countries

1827
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,200
The rice varieties he grows are different

1828
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:49,520
So he wants to put this gene on different breeds

1829
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,160
So in the future, different countries can grow

1830
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,920
I have always hoped that it can be commercialized as soon as possible.

1831
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,000
Because it is really possible every year

1832
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,960
very, very much of this life

1833
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,740
But environmental groups continue to protest

1834
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,300
What about the research and development of this golden rice?

1835
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:10,300
Probably only cost about two million dollars

1836
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,840
But in order to cope with environmental groups doing biosafety assessments

1837
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:15,800
$20 million spent

1838
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,500
There is still no way to promote

1839
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:23,700
Many people are impatient

1840
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,300
so this one this one is the most recent

1841
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,300
Sorry I forgot to call this

1842
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:30,460
Where did it come from?

1843
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:31,300
This is Nature

1844
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,500
An article published by Nature

1845
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:36,540
it's talking about this

1846
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,800
Chinese children's golden rice experiment

1847
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,460
and then punished

1848
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:44,300
This is why some scientists were punished

1849
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:47,500
This is a one in Boston

1850
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,800
Cup University of Boston, USA

1851
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:52,460
Tang Guanwen, a female professor of Chinese descent

1852
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,460
Then she and Xinjiang

1853
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:58,620
Collaboration with some scholars in Xinjiang, Mainland China

1854
01:17:58,920 --> 01:17:59,420
Come

1855
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,640
Eat this gold and silver for little ones

1856
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,340
Then I read his articles here

1857
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,540
The two sides are talking about each other

1858
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:10,840
the scientists he said

1859
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,100
He also passed through many units

1860
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,040
I agreed to do this experiment.

1861
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:19,680
But after this matter was exposed by the media

1862
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,240
Many people are afraid

1863
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:22,640
then start by saying

1864
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,540
We were originally publishing the report

1865
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:28,700
the people who hang on to you start saying

1866
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,940
We also don't know what experiments he was doing.

1867
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:34,200
then i have nothing to do with me

1868
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:37,540
Because in the end someone was arrested and locked up

1869
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:38,900
so it's a pity

1870
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:40,640
Then he drew this cartoon

1871
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,200
like an american

1872
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,700
because you see he has an american flag on his tie

1873
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:49,000
Then he put this gold and silver this gold and silver

1874
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,740
for the children of China

1875
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:54,240
So in fact his report

1876
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,200
published has been published

1877
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:00,000
And his result is very good

1878
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,400
Because they had three sets of experiments

1879
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,040
A group is to eat gold

1880
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,440
One group is to eat spinach

1881
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,800
Another group is to eat

1882
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,840
Beta Carotene Capsules

1883
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,240
The results of it

1884
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:17,320
Eating gold gives you exactly the same effect as taking beta carotene capsules

1885
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,320
So it actually works really well

1886
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,240
But because of the media

1887
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,640
Then the protests of environmental groups

1888
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,560
Now temporarily suppressed again

1889
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,600
But the mainland

1890
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:35,640
He's genetically engineered various crops

1891
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,920
A very positive country

1892
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,800
All but the most active countries in the world

1893
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,200
The United States is of course very active

1894
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,560
or countries in the Americas

1895
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:49,400
Because they make a lot of money by exporting this gene

1896
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,520
The other one is like China, India

1897
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,440
because he has too many people

1898
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:57,080
He is very sensitive to the food of the people

1899
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:59,360
Our government in Taiwan is not sensitive at all

1900
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,040
we must be

1901
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,600
Autonomy is only 32%

1902
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,760
Do you know what percentage is in mainland China?

1903
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,700
it's 95%

1904
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:10,000
So mainland China pays more attention to whether its people can have enough to eat

1905
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,760
You can't have enough to eat, you can't eat enough

1906
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,160
If you can't eat enough, you will be messed up

1907
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:16,960
So the top executives in the mainland said

1908
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,560
Although this happened

1909
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,260
Our genetic engineering technology is still the same

1910
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:25,800
Because they see the future really depends on this technology

1911
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,800
So in addition to the golden rice just mentioned

1912
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,960
In fact, there are many other things to do

1913
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,700
many people are doing

1914
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,100
increase its protein content

1915
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:42,700
Iron core, anti-oxidant, etc.

1916
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:45,300
Actually m it is very

1917
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:48,100
Its protein quality is very good

1918
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:49,300
easy to digest

1919
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:51,800
Too bad it's not high enough

1920
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,100
So many people say

1921
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:57,200
can hope to increase its protein content

1922
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,360
These genetically engineered plants

1923
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,460
what else can be done

1924
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:04,600
Let's take an example

1925
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,200
it can produce this oral vaccine

1926
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,900
That is to say, you are produced in the tomato

1927
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,800
produced in spinach

1928
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,300
You just dry the capsules and put them on

1929
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,760
Then the doctor will tell you

1930
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,060
you eat two this week

1931
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:18,860
next week two

1932
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:20,460
Eat a few in a few weeks

1933
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:21,560
you are vaccinated

1934
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:25,000
For many countries in this weak or region

1935
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,160
is very important

1936
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,160
Because many vaccines need to be iced

1937
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,860
They don't have a fridge, they don't have mats

1938
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,560
or no medical staff

1939
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,660
Can help them inoculate these diseases

1940
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:39,860
So this oral vaccine

1941
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:42,260
actually very good

1942
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:44,860
i think kids

1943
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:45,860
not only children

1944
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:47,660
Many adults are afraid of needles

1945
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:48,760
so in the future

1946
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,760
this oral vaccine

1947
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:53,020
You just eat it and get vaccinated.

1948
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:54,760
This is a lot of successful examples

1949
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:55,520
has been very successful

1950
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,260
And some of them are already commercialized

1951
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:00,060
so this

1952
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,800
It was drawn by my daughter

1953
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,160
Then he draws his brother

1954
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,720
well , this time he drew his dad

1955
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,560
Head of education teacher

1956
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,600
that because we all know

1957
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,760
It's just that people don't like injections.

1958
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,880
But this future oral vaccine

1959
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,520
is really able to do this

1960
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:23,520
ok , ok , let ' s talk again

1961
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:26,160
What kind of work are we doing in Taiwan

1962
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:29,680
We are doing the function letter gold of the plant

1963
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,560
Somatic research, it should be said that the functional information of rice

1964
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:33,360
body research

1965
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,240
Because we need to borrow useful genes from plants

1966
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,600
we just talked a lot

1967
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,480
Can do this kind of genetic engineering law

1968
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,520
then we have to find out

1969
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,520
what kind of genes are useful

1970
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:49,680
Then let's put the usage where I want it

1971
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,840
Then this is his rice

1972
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,520
A schematic diagram of the 12 chromosomes

1973
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:58,120
He refers to the number of his genes one by one

1974
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,320
The darker the color, the number of genes

1975
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:00,820
more

1976
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,840
Then this in Japanese

1977
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,400
when they first started

1978
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,920
It is he who does the job of interpreting

1979
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:09,240
What is an explanation?

1980
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,240
as if

1981
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,120
word in a dictionary

1982
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,520
ABCD is in a mess

1983
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,360
Then what

1984
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:19,280
You're going to start arranging it in ABCD

1985
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,760
Then XYZ lines up

1986
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,160
So it's a job of interpretation

1987
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:27,840
So the position of each experience on the chromosome

1988
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,400
you fix it

1989
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,560
that job is very important

1990
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,840
so at first

1991
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,000
japanese do it themselves

1992
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:37,880
when he started doing

1993
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,120
Many people laugh at him as stupid

1994
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:42,120
Because this job costs a lot of money

1995
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,760
it will take a lot of time

1996
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,520
that was later

1997
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,200
Many countries have begun to discover

1998
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,200
This is a very important job

1999
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:52,080
then start assisting

2000
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,120
turn around and look at him

2001
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,200
have completed this chromosome

2002
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,320
the work of interpretation

2003
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:58,320
National conditions can be hung on it

2004
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:58,920
good

2005
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,120
So Japan hangs this much

2006
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,460
then other countries

2007
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,460
Then our national flag of the Republic of China

2008
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:06,160
This is us in 1999 2004

2009
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,360
former botanical institute

2010
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,560
It is now called Plant Language Living Documentation Office

2011
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,260
This is a lot of teachers

2012
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:14,820
Including Mr. Xi Yu as the program host

2013
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:16,160
he is here now

2014
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,300
we gritted our teeth

2015
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:21,460
Because it costs a lot of money to do it

2016
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:23,000
that just started

2017
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,700
I also want to say if it's me

2018
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:26,700
don't totally do that much

2019
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:27,760
don't spend so much money

2020
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:29,700
But our neighbors are not alone

2021
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:33,660
After that, the national flag will be placed with us

2022
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:36,120
So we did it by ourselves

2023
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,120
so what about our flag

2024
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,900
always on the fifth chromosome

2025
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:42,360
No one can remove him

2026
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:45,120
So this is a very important job

2027
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,820
Alright, let's line up from ABCD to XYZ

2028
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:51,120
But the problem is he didn't hold tight

2029
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,900
you don't know what it means to say book

2030
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:55,620
what does girl mean

2031
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:57,820
Then we have to give him meaning

2032
01:24:57,820 --> 01:24:59,980
So we go down and take each

2033
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
The function of the gene needs to be solved

2034
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:06,240
Waterways contain nearly 40,000 genes

2035
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:10,080
How to study the functions of so many genes

2036
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,200
it's difficult

2037
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,400
Because often a person's life

2038
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,360
Studying only one gene previously

2039
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,440
In other words, several people are studying a single gene

2040
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,560
So we have a strategy

2041
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:25,520
That is to say, we just use the method of genetic engineering

2042
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,600
Insert it from a foreign gene

2043
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,640
Feel free to plug in and have a chance

2044
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,440
it plugs into the gene

2045
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:34,440
It will destroy the gene

2046
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,480
what happens to it after it is destroyed

2047
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:38,640
mutation

2048
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,160
Let's talk about mutations later

2049
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:45,320
So here we are

2050
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:47,360
I didn't write here

2051
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:53,640
Ten years from roughly 2002 to 2012

2052
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:56,400
Doing this job for more than ten years

2053
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:00,000
Then we build this channel

2054
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,600
Gene Mutation Database and Database

2055
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:06,160
In total we have more than 100,000 mutant lines

2056
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:09,160
Then what gene, what DNA is inserted into our

2057
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,200
we all have to figure it out

2058
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,960
Make a database with more than 60,000

2059
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:17,000
So we publish this report

2060
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,200
Mr. Li and other cooperating teachers

2061
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,000
This is a very important job

2062
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,760
Because all over the world like this

2063
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,760
Mutation library and database like this

2064
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,760
also only 4

2065
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:37,760
Taiwan, South Korea, China and France

2066
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,760
China, of course, has many

2067
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,760
Because it has a lot of people, it has to do this thing

2068
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,760
it is also very easy to do

2069
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,760
But in terms of quality and publicity

2070
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:51,760
On the ease of use of the database

2071
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:55,760
Taiwan and South Korea are the two best general pools

2072
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,760
Then we added some special new clothes

2073
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,760
I have time to explain to you

2074
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,400
That is to say, our quality is actually quite good.

2075
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:08,600
So we accumulated like this

2076
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,040
Picture total circle library

2077
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,480
Then we published

2078
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:15,560
One year later there will be this Science

2079
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:17,080
sorry for the question

2080
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,520
Cannot return the ticket directly

2081
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,120
Puncture Science

2082
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:24,040
He just came one day to give my aunt

2083
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,120
in 2008

2084
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:26,560
I published in 2007

2085
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,360
In 2008

2086
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:29,520
he just told us

2087
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:30,600
tell me

2088
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,000
Our report

2089
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,800
In the plant field of the world

2090
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,840
The number of times used by the camp is the top one percent

2091
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,240
So it's a big honor

2092
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,080
So he asked me a lot of questions

2093
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:43,040
say why

2094
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,640
Your total library

2095
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,840
Can be used by so many people

2096
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,800
I will tell them the reason

2097
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:52,400
I said that everyone paid attention

2098
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,880
Our total library

2099
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,360
and why

2100
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,880
This was just introduced by the vice president

2101
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,840
Our Gates Foundation

2102
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,040
support us to do

2103
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,400
This project of a western rice in this world

2104
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,560
Because rice is a three-type plant

2105
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,400
That's like corn sorghum

2106
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,160
Sugarcane is a four-type plant

2107
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,160
Its photosynthesis efficiency is better

2108
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:16,240
well, we don't have time to explain this today

2109
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,320
But now everyone wants to say

2110
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:22,520
Can convert rice into something like corn sorghum

2111
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:25,280
Its efficiency of photosynthesis is improved

2112
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,840
In this way, its yield can be increased

2113
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:33,440
Because the photosynthetic efficiency of corn is 40% higher than that of rice

2114
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:36,880
He said that if the photosynthetic efficiency of rice can

2115
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,760
If it is increased by 140% like corn

2116
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,960
We could probably be more than 40 percent of the population

2117
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:47,800
So that's why it's important to have a global program

2118
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:52,040
There are nearly 25 research laboratories around the world participating

2119
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:55,360
Then Mr. Li Yu and I represent Taiwan

2120
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,640
It's in this plan

2121
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,880
So this also shows that our

2122
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,240
An importance of the general research library

2123
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:06,740
Okay, so what is a mutation?

2124
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:09,340
What exactly is our general research library doing?

2125
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,740
This is a diagram

2126
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:16,140
That is to say, the nucleus inside our cells

2127
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:18,300
It contains our chromosomes

2128
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:20,240
Chromosomes have DNA

2129
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,540
it's our genetics

2130
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:23,540
genetic material

2131
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:26,540
Then our DNA will make protein

2132
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:28,340
what we just said

2133
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:31,180
We just insert the DNA from the outside

2134
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:32,980
right to destroy the gene

2135
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:35,680
So it's us inserting the gene

2136
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:36,340
So something like this

2137
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:38,480
Your protein is also destroyed

2138
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,980
Then it starts to have some traits

2139
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,080
Normally, there is only one flower

2140
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:45,080
I am now three flowers

2141
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:48,280
This seed was originally so small, but it has become so big

2142
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,380
Originally without color, it becomes colored

2143
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:52,480
I used to be so tall, but now I'm so short

2144
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,580
I used to be so tall, I became so tall

2145
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:55,880
higher

2146
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,020
This can grow to over 200 cm in a greenhouse

2147
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,200
This should have gone up

2148
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:05,160
It loses its direction and keeps spinning

2149
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:06,920
and this angle

2150
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:08,800
should have been upwards

2151
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,160
it becomes horizontal

2152
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,760
the leaves swell

2153
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,760
Then some leafy trees are gone

2154
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,720
There are so many

2155
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,000
we are a vault

2156
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:19,480
There are a lot of such univariate traits in it.

2157
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:22,040
allows us to study many gene functions

2158
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,200
because i know now

2159
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:27,160
what kind of genetic disruption is this one

2160
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:29,840
Then let me become like this

2161
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,920
This is a method for studying gene function

2162
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,560
Then we get from our general research database

2163
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,720
just find some important genes

2164
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,080
This is the meter that controls it

2165
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:42,880
That can also be high yield

2166
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,600
You can see the meter get bigger

2167
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,280
Broken and more

2168
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,720
the whole encouragement

2169
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:51,720
it also increases

2170
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:55,720
Then this is cooperating with foreign biotechnology companies

2171
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:56,520
this effect

2172
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:58,720
they work pretty well

2173
01:30:58,720 --> 01:30:59,720
what about the other

2174
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,600
We just mentioned the first green revolution

2175
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:05,460
This rice and wheat make it dwarf

2176
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,240
right

2177
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:07,400
so we are

2178
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,660
But now the traditional filter

2179
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:13,400
It's not easy for you to control its height at will

2180
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:16,900
The current rice is still somewhat too high

2181
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:18,540
If possible in such

2182
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:20,840
Almost 80% of the words left

2183
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:24,540
or 70% its that height might be just right

2184
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:28,040
So now we can filter out varieties like this

2185
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:30,740
so any height is fine

2186
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:33,540
Then let's look at its output

2187
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:35,740
Sure enough, this height

2188
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:38,540
Its output can be increased by 30%

2189
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:41,240
And it is also more resistant to soldering

2190
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,640
So this is what we have now

2191
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:48,240
Some research results that can be done in Taiwan

2192
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:52,440
And we just mentioned that

2193
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,340
Is this a dry soldering problem?

2194
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:56,140
we also have this gene

2195
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:57,840
What about gene transfer?

2196
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:00,140
experience non-experience you from appearance

2197
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,540
Can't see it

2198
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:03,960
But you didn't water for two weeks

2199
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,740
The leaves are curled up

2200
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:08,640
Then you water it for another thirty minutes

2201
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,640
Only genetically engineered it can recover

2202
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:14,340
To genetically engineered it dies

2203
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:15,000
good

2204
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:18,840
In such a dry place in the future

2205
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,840
Is it possible that we can grow some rice

2206
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:23,500
good

2207
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:26,540
This is a dream to pursue

2208
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:27,900
this is

2209
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:30,400
This is Ang Lee, he also said

2210
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:31,860
he has been chasing his dream

2211
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,040
Then he also succeeded

2212
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,360
I think for those of us who do molecular biology

2213
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:36,900
We also often have a dream

2214
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:38,940
It's actually based on your imagination

2215
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:42,060
There are many things that are possible in the future

2216
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:46,440
Then the first question is actually a lot of questions

2217
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:49,100
That is, in many countries, the temperature may be too low

2218
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:51,760
Or high dimension and high altitude or something

2219
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:53,700
Sometimes it's cold in winter

2220
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:55,440
Many crops will freeze to death

2221
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:59,780
Therefore, the first question is also an important issue.

2222
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,880
We have a waterway of genetically modified genes here

2223
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,000
This is a non-genetic diversion

2224
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,400
This one here is also a gene

2225
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:10,000
It's just that we genetically make it behave less

2226
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
so it won't work

2227
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,760
It won't work after seven or eight hours on the fourth road

2228
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:18,000
Then this non-gene and this have a lot of performance

2229
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
The genes we gave it were okay

2230
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:23,200
That's 18 hours later

2231
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,600
Only the water height of our genes can survive

2232
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,800
The non-genetic ones and the ones that we make the gene expression less will not work

2233
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:34,000
So this is the cold resistance gene

2234
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,600
so many places are too cold

2235
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:39,600
Can we also be in those places in the future

2236
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,600
These cold resistance genes can also be planted

2237
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,400
now because it is

2238
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,600
really urgent

2239
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,600
Many places were originally unsuitable for planting crops

2240
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:50,600
We will all find ways to plant

2241
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,000
what about words

2242
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Originally also

2243
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,800
We have this genetically modified waterway

2244
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
before processing

2245
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
This is

2246
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,400
Also upgrade the fly gene

2247
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:03,000
The five next to this

2248
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,600
All five lines were genetically transformed

2249
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,900
then soak in salt water

2250
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:09,400
250g minimum

2251
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,200
it's very high in salt

2252
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,200
salt concentration

2253
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:13,900
almost like sea water

2254
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:15,700
This soaked for three weeks

2255
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,800
You see, this genetically transformed person is dead

2256
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:20,000
What we genetically transform can also be peeled off

2257
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,500
So this gene is very powerful

2258
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,000
our this

2259
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,100
This Taiwan, this southwest salt

2260
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:28,000
There are still many deserted salt pans

2261
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:29,000
What about the future?

2262
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:29,700
Now

2263
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:31,700
Is it possible in the future

2264
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:34,000
These crops can also be grown

2265
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:36,800
good ok

2266
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:39,600
ok finally let's talk about this

2267
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:42,400
Current Global Trends in GM Crops

2268
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,600
Because we've talked so much about genetics

2269
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:45,900
that global

2270
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,300
everybody every country

2271
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:49,500
what kind of thought is it now

2272
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,300
what are they doing

2273
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,000
this

2274
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,500
Genetic crops started in 1996

2275
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,800
So this curve you can see

2276
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,320
by 2011

2277
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:06,140
His increased area

2278
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:08,440
This is a developing country

2279
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:11,260
combined by developing countries

2280
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:13,820
1996

2281
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,880
only so much time

2282
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:18,440
This is only 15,000 hectares

2283
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:22,020
160 million hectares by 2011

2284
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:24,840
9% of global renewable energy

2285
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:25,600
Now

2286
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:27,400
Genetic crops

2287
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,180
He multiplied 10,000 times

2288
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:33,280
Think about the weak things that can make the world go like this

2289
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:35,060
Many countries go to the weak

2290
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:37,620
He must be something that can stand the test

2291
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:39,680
Otherwise, it is impossible for so many countries

2292
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:40,960
in species

2293
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:45,820
And what about his production value?

2294
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:49,160
is continuously rising until 2011

2295
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,940
What about the production value of the seeds?

2296
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,500
reached $12 billion

2297
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,340
This is an area below

2298
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:58,880
Then there is the production value

2299
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,800
what crops are grown

2300
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:06,640
The main ones are soybeans, corn, cotton and rapeseed

2301
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:10,100
Soybeans are eaten by both animals and humans

2302
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:12,980
corn is eaten by animals

2303
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:16,020
Cotton, clothes, and rapeseed are eaten by people

2304
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:20,520
Then this is the area where it is planted

2305
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:22,720
One million hectares

2306
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,760
Then what

2307
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:26,760
What kind of features are most

2308
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:30,360
Anti-weed killer or anti-insect or double anti-

2309
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:33,460
Now there are a lot of two features together

2310
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:36,460
So insect resistance is what I just explained to you

2311
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:39,860
That protein of that BT

2312
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:43,740
I didn't talk about anti-weed killers in particular today

2313
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:45,740
It also has many benefits

2314
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:49,980
But I want to say don't say it seems to be doing publicity for these companies

2315
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:52,180
So I'm not talking about this in particular

2316
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:53,580
But it can be seen that

2317
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:57,440
Its area is really rising

2318
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:00,440
OK, this area has just been increased

2319
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,600
we really tuned in

2320
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,160
Where are the countries where the planting is distributed?

2321
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,800
These colored, colored countries

2322
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,960
is the country where it was planted

2323
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:13,920
By 2011 there were already 29 countries

2324
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:16,160
I have been teaching for so many years

2325
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,560
Almost every year I have to update

2326
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:19,760
must update why

2327
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:21,920
Because almost two countries are added every year

2328
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,760
the number of two countries

2329
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,920
that this

2330
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,280
this

2331
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:30,240
of course you look at me

2332
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:33,200
The United States, of course, is the first

2333
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,240
Canada

2334
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,400
Then this Sino-American

2335
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:38,560
then south american countries

2336
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:40,080
Most of them are planted

2337
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:43,680
Then the mainland, India, South Africa, Australia

2338
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:46,640
you see even this europe

2339
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,800
Several countries have planted

2340
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:52,000
Look like Sweden, Germany, Spain

2341
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:54,160
all kinds

2342
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:55,440
OK

2343
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,520
so you can watch a trend

2344
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:01,200
Then

2345
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,700
Well, so many countries are doing

2346
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:03,700
But many people still care

2347
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:08,100
This machine-modified crop is being used by our food and the environment

2348
01:38:08,260 --> 01:38:11,300
Safe, I want to do it again, there are many people

2349
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:13,500
It's probably always been the same problem.

2350
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:17,660
Then we are here to explain to you

2351
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:20,960
let's start by saying

2352
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:24,260
Because we just had a rough idea of ​​what the machine modification is all about.

2353
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:27,660
It's like putting a gene from the outside and then putting it in.

2354
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:31,280
But let's find out first

2355
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,920
In fact, our human body already has a lot of these

2356
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,560
We just said that in the process of green seeding

2357
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:40,720
Many genes have been exchanged like this

2358
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:44,760
That plants, animals, including people, etc.

2359
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:49,320
That person, including people, some very important things

2360
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,120
Let's first look at the cells of our human body

2361
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,320
Inside human cells Inside animal cells

2362
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:57,120
There must be this green line

2363
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:59,940
But what about plants, it will have a

2364
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
It's only for plants

2365
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,420
neither animals

2366
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:05,100
this is our nucleus

2367
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:08,100
Our genetic material is inside this nucleus

2368
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:10,600
For plants it has this cell coin

2369
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,600
But animals don't have this cell currency

2370
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:16,100
These are two very important organs

2371
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:18,600
Why do I mention these two organs in particular

2372
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:20,600
Leaf lift phenomenon

2373
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:25,200
Yelu mentioned that it needs to carry out photosynthesis

2374
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,200
so sun down

2375
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:31,200
Then there is this carbon dioxide and water for photosynthesis

2376
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,200
produce glucose

2377
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:36,200
Glucose provides this force embodiment

2378
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:39,200
to generate energy

2379
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:43,200
So our sugar photosynthesis

2380
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,200
Yeluti

2381
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:48,200
Energy is generated by this force

2382
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:51,200
All animals must have this power manifested

2383
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:53,200
otherwise there is no way to live

2384
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,200
You can't live because you don't have energy

2385
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:58,200
All plants must have both

2386
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,200
Yeluti

2387
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,860
it has cuboid

2388
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:04,500
That plant contributes a lot

2389
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:06,460
Before this teacher Wu Suxin

2390
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:08,360
I guess he also said this knowledge

2391
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:10,960
this inside our earth

2392
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,960
all carbohydrates

2393
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:17,200
Almost all are produced by plants for us.

2394
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:19,300
what we eat every day

2395
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:21,260
are produced by plants

2396
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:23,400
multidimensional organisms

2397
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:24,900
it depends on it

2398
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:25,900
so no plants

2399
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:28,160
The world has probably

2400
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:30,360
Only some dimensional creatures are left

2401
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:32,760
those two organs

2402
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:36,720
Cells 2.7 billion years ago

2403
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,520
In fact, these two organs do not exist.

2404
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:43,220
But I don't know under what circumstances

2405
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:44,960
this our cells

2406
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:48,720
prokaryotic it is a prokaryotic cell

2407
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:50,460
Originally from lower organisms

2408
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:55,420
it eats into the cuboid

2409
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:57,820
You can see that it contains this stereo

2410
01:40:57,820 --> 01:40:59,920
And then there are some cells

2411
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,500
It's a leprosome that's actually a bacterium

2412
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:04,660
Bacteria

2413
01:41:04,820 --> 01:41:07,000
After it eats the bacteria

2414
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:08,360
This bacterium becomes

2415
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:10,760
In this cell it becomes a stroma

2416
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:12,660
Then there are some cells

2417
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:14,860
it eats some algae

2418
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:16,860
So what happens after the algae enters?

2419
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:18,460
become this plant

2420
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:21,660
it becomes leptin and chloroplast

2421
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:24,100
So plants can photosynthesize

2422
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:26,360
What about its primitive ancestor?

2423
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:29,760
from this photosynthetic bacterium

2424
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:32,680
So our current higher organisms

2425
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:34,620
not just all kinds of animals

2426
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:35,780
including humans

2427
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,360
And this variety of plants

2428
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:39,960
inside our cells

2429
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:44,680
There are already some of its fire doctor creatures coming

2430
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,720
or genes from algae

2431
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,400
already inside us

2432
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:51,320
So after so many years of evolution

2433
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,720
can coexist with us

2434
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:57,200
Then look at the natural world

2435
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:58,160
what about all creatures

2436
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:59,960
cells themselves

2437
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
constantly evolving

2438
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:02,960
you don't need to green it

2439
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:04,960
It's already evolving

2440
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:07,200
You see, there can be many, many butterflies

2441
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:10,280
Beetles can be very, very plentiful

2442
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:11,360
Then what

2443
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:12,840
like this fish for example

2444
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,320
You are a fish and it can live well

2445
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:17,880
What about two fish?

2446
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:20,760
What about good friends getting married and having kids?

2447
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,640
produce a better fish to survive

2448
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,560
then if you can't

2449
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,480
have produced better fish

2450
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:30,800
Your original fish may not be competitive

2451
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,560
this is irresponsible

2452
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:34,680
It turned out to be worse

2453
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:35,680
was wiped out

2454
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:36,520
just die

2455
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:38,480
So in nature

2456
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:40,320
In fact, it is constantly

2457
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:43,160
have been genetically between various organisms

2458
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,320
Inside the creature

2459
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,840
Its genes are constantly changing

2460
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:48,840
Except for this natural world

2461
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
natural mating

2462
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:51,560
among many other reasons

2463
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:54,520
All living things are infected by viruses

2464
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
What about the virus?

2465
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,720
It also carries genes into our body

2466
01:42:58,880 --> 01:42:59,600
then

2467
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,760
Collapsing into our genetic body

2468
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:04,360
then become part of us

2469
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:07,400
So actually you say that nature species

2470
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:10,360
In fact, the gene is constantly mixing

2471
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:12,120
is a very natural phenomenon

2472
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:14,520
OK so virus infection

2473
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:17,200
It is also the constant mutation and evolution of this gene

2474
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:18,640
a very important reason

2475
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:21,640
ok then let's find out

2476
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:23,080
Well, this genetic change

2477
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:25,800
It's not really a terrible thing

2478
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:28,000
Because nature is constantly happening

2479
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:29,800
But it's a real problem for us

2480
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:31,960
which means we eat these plants

2481
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:32,960
safe or not

2482
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,760
like a genetic plant before it goes to market

2483
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,480
it will definitely do some experiments

2484
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:39,320
Toxicity to animals Hypersensitivity

2485
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:42,080
changes in nutrients, etc.

2486
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,520
It has to go through these experiments

2487
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:48,280
I always say

2488
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:50,160
These things are genetically modified

2489
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:52,000
There is nothing to be afraid of when you eat it in your stomach

2490
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:52,640
Why

2491
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:56,360
Because the main components are DNA and protein

2492
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:59,080
Just like the rice we eat every day

2493
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:00,080
vegetables water

2494
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
The ingredients are almost the same, after eating in the stomach

2495
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:05,160
inside your stomach

2496
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:09,600
There are already a lot of this decomposing mold

2497
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:13,700
Inside the Tuo Ye, Stomach Leaf, Chair Leaf, and Intestine Leaf

2498
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:15,700
Just a lot of decomposing mold

2499
01:44:15,700 --> 01:44:17,840
protein

2500
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:20,500
There are protein molds, nucleic acid molds, etc.

2501
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:21,640
digested

2502
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:23,300
Or the absorption of nutrients

2503
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:26,600
So, the genetic thing it's not

2504
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,000
Phytochemicals are not pesticides

2505
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:33,200
not this preservative

2506
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,300
not antibiotics

2507
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:38,600
Not what these you fear will cause

2508
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:41,200
something that accumulates or is harmful to a person

2509
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:43,800
Basically, it is digested in the stomach

2510
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:45,500
This experiment has done a lot

2511
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,200
Animal experiments are done a lot

2512
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:48,800
there is evidence

2513
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,800
So actually we really are

2514
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:54,400
Already eat a lot of genetic stuff

2515
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:58,400
Although everyone has a question

2516
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,000
That is to say, I ate genetically

2517
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,840
Safety actually went on the market in 1996 until now

2518
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,160
we ate a lot

2519
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:07,880
Because there are very few soybeans grown in Taiwan

2520
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:11,320
More than 90% of the vast majority are imported

2521
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:13,320
mostly chicken wings

2522
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:19,560
Many bean products on the market are chicken wings

2523
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:20,920
but we have rules

2524
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:23,520
If your protein content reaches 5%

2525
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:24,800
you are going to sign

2526
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,640
so you look carefully

2527
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:28,360
you will see that it is written very small

2528
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,800
write about genetic modification

2529
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,320
Of course there are some Chinese tofu now

2530
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:35,320
Printed tofu is non-GMO

2531
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:36,440
it writes big

2532
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:40,160
Actually there is no need

2533
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:41,160
don't worry about that

2534
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:42,760
we really eat a lot

2535
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:45,560
There are many in the world

2536
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:48,120
Human experiments have been done for more than 10 years

2537
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:48,920
no problem

2538
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:50,520
so don't worry about these things

2539
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:51,880
what are you really worried about

2540
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:54,360
I go to see it every time

2541
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,360
look at this

2542
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,360
What is facial agent

2543
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
It's just a chemical.

2544
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
and what preservatives

2545
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:04,000
biphasic acid

2546
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:07,500
Then what is the cost of acid and so on

2547
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:08,660
actually a lot

2548
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:10,000
if you can look carefully

2549
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:13,000
Many foods actually contain these

2550
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:15,160
bring these to the government there are regulations

2551
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:17,660
But is it really at home according to the rules?

2552
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:19,620
not very clear

2553
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:20,800
In fact, often still

2554
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,000
Occasionally it's on the news

2555
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:24,920
So I will also buy

2556
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:26,000
try to buy this

2557
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:27,660
fog chill preservative stuff

2558
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:29,660
so this

2559
01:46:30,820 --> 01:46:32,820
this is a worry

2560
01:46:32,980 --> 01:46:34,480
don't worry about this

2561
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:35,980
don't need to worry that much

2562
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,660
good

2563
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:38,420
Then we just mentioned that

2564
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:40,420
the effect on the environment

2565
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:42,420
This is on the biosafety assessment

2566
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:43,580
will definitely do

2567
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,080
So we already mentioned

2568
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:47,660
This crop like their insect-resistant

2569
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:50,460
For this helpful sleepy bug

2570
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:51,780
actually very good

2571
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:52,620
so what

2572
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:55,260
Definitely do some field biosecurity assessments

2573
01:46:55,420 --> 01:46:57,060
For example, will he turn into a weed?

2574
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:59,780
Possibility of interbreeding with Jinyuan weeds

2575
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,460
morbid relationship

2576
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:04,720
Relationships with other intentional insects, animals, etc.

2577
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:07,220
So it's actually under the magnifying glass

2578
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:09,920
View to be able to list

2579
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,660
Pollen spread is of course possible.

2580
01:47:12,820 --> 01:47:15,860
This is something that many groups keep coming up with.

2581
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:18,500
he said you would spread

2582
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:21,060
that's actually possible

2583
01:47:21,220 --> 01:47:25,100
But this can be done by a lot of management

2584
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:29,140
Then we'll review the management later

2585
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:31,720
Is this pesticide spraying?

2586
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:34,180
That is to say, those crops that are resistant to insects

2587
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:36,640
Will it be a problem with intentional insects?

2588
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,140
we have just explained

2589
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:40,300
The results done so far show

2590
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:42,900
there's nothing wrong with it

2591
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:44,940
I'm sorry

2592
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:48,600
So this pollen will spread

2593
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:49,940
in what way

2594
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:51,980
This is an experiment done by Farming

2595
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:54,900
you just have to fence it around

2596
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:58,860
Or you give it enough isolation space

2597
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,700
It can separate the pollen

2598
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:04,160
This is rice research

2599
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,560
You can put genetically modified ones together

2600
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:08,000
a piece of non-genetically modified

2601
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,800
If there is this green mud in the middle, it will be surrounded

2602
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,600
Its streaming rate is 0

2603
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,440
And what about the distance

2604
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:18,160
It's completely 0 at about 40 meters

2605
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:21,000
At 35 meters, there will be very little

2606
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,560
The odds are pretty cool

2607
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:25,160
So in fact the fill-in experiment

2608
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:27,960
You have to do these things to be listed

2609
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:30,560
So we finally mention that

2610
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:33,360
Is genetic food safe?

2611
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:34,160
Yes

2612
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:36,760
Because they have undergone strict animal safety assessment

2613
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:39,660
Then there is one more important thing to say

2614
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:41,360
a lot of this bone

2615
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:44,360
Because insects will eat and have wounds later

2616
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:46,160
then it grows syringa

2617
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:48,860
Aflatoxin

2618
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:53,560
This is a very serious factor that can cause cancer

2619
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:55,960
so we sometimes eat this peanut

2620
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:58,560
Especially peanuts imported from Southeast Asia

2621
01:48:58,760 --> 01:48:59,760
be careful

2622
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,800
Maybe there are some plums in it

2623
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:03,600
xanthotoxin

2624
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:07,400
Then if you eat it, it will cause cancer

2625
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:08,640
it's a terrible thing

2626
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:09,840
but they found

2627
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,840
Since these corns with this insect resistance

2628
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,600
The ratio of producing this aflatoxin is greatly reduced

2629
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:18,360
So it's not just pesticide reduction

2630
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:20,400
It also does not produce aflatoxin

2631
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:22,400
Nutrients can then be added

2632
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,160
Then it can correspond to the rapidly increasing population

2633
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,720
for us in taiwan

2634
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:33,680
This kind of effect can resist insects and diseases

2635
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,400
is actually very important

2636
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:36,400
Why?

2637
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:40,360
In European and American countries, they are heavily valued

2638
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:44,600
He wants something like wet stacking or using pesticides or something

2639
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,000
It's all done by airplanes

2640
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:49,720
Or he has this automatic irrigation system

2641
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:51,960
But in Southeast Asian countries

2642
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:54,280
Much like Taiwan

2643
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:57,520
Many farmers still use their own spray

2644
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:59,960
Look, the farmer probably didn't bring anything.

2645
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,160
this security

2646
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:04,160
This is still very common

2647
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:06,360
If you really want to play defense

2648
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:07,360
it's ok

2649
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,760
But is it possible for farmers to do this?

2650
01:50:10,760 --> 01:50:15,960
All seem to be preventing and treating SARS

2651
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:19,360
This is a potato chip from the mainland

2652
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:20,000
them

2653
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,840
I don't know how they really defend

2654
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:22,840
very strange

2655
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:23,840
OK

2656
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:26,240
anything else

2657
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:27,840
Taiwan is actually better now

2658
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,360
That is to say, there are some rooted systems

2659
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,800
there is a special

2660
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,480
Because our villages are aging now

2661
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:35,080
Many farmers are also farming, but they can't move too much.

2662
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:37,640
So let others do it

2663
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:38,600
Then what

2664
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:41,800
In fact, there are some better technical

2665
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:42,560
Progressive

2666
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:47,440
It's to use an unmanned aircraft to accompany you.

2667
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,920
So Taiwan is now also like this

2668
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:50,800
but think about it

2669
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:53,680
Is it possible that in the future every farmer will be at the edge of the field

2670
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:55,800
shake the plane there

2671
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:56,880
silly pesticide

2672
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:59,320
I think it would be interesting if there was a day

2673
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,600
really passed

2674
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:04,680
But then again

2675
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:06,280
Can we avoid pen and pesticide

2676
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:08,000
Actually it's the most important

2677
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:10,040
Because you need to use pesticides to pen pesticides

2678
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:12,320
It takes money and energy

2679
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:15,480
then pollute the environment

2680
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:17,040
Then what

2681
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:19,080
Mostly farmers

2682
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:20,840
farmers hurt the most

2683
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,400
In fact, every year there are farmers

2684
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:25,120
Poisoning yourself from pen pesticides

2685
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:27,280
so this

2686
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:29,720
or let the plants themselves

2687
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:30,800
resistant to illness

2688
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:33,000
Its benefits are much more

2689
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:35,680
That plus the amount of pesticides used in Taiwan

2690
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:37,680
2.5 times the Asian average

2691
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:38,800
5 times that of the US

2692
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:39,920
very scary

2693
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:41,960
Because Taiwan is hot and humid

2694
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:44,480
Therefore, those who are particularly prone to long-term weaving are seriously ill

2695
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:47,560
So I think Taiwan needs to develop

2696
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:49,560
The crop of experience like this

2697
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:51,360
but what about our government

2698
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:53,320
What about our entire Council of Agriculture?

2699
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:54,800
civil service system

2700
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:56,840
they can

2701
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,560
This is less wrong

2702
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,760
this less

2703
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,280
once more is worse than once less

2704
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:03,280
Then it's better not to worry about anything

2705
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:05,680
So many of our

2706
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:07,320
Taiwan's technology is actually very good

2707
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:09,160
we have a lot of good this

2708
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:11,960
This product of genetic engineering

2709
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:12,960
not easy to market

2710
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:15,720
I think our agriculture

2711
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:16,720
National import chemist

2712
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:18,040
Or agricultural fertility industry plan

2713
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:18,960
our people

2714
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:20,520
Professor Wu Jinglie is here

2715
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:21,760
he deeply understands

2716
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:23,160
This one from Taiwan

2717
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:25,360
The potential of our researchers is very good

2718
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:27,640
We can have many good products

2719
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:28,960
Just told Ang Lee

2720
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:31,400
We have a lot of this in Taiwan

2721
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:32,920
People who work in the electric business industry

2722
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:33,720
very talented

2723
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:35,200
But there is no way to play

2724
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:36,400
Why

2725
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:40,320
think about this

2726
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:40,960
good

2727
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:42,920
So I am very concerned about this issue

2728
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:46,040
So I often write articles

2729
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:47,160
Then what

2730
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:47,520
strangeness

2731
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:50,360
His computer will run by itself today

2732
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:51,200
Eh

2733
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,520
Oops

2734
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:53,680
OK

2735
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:55,120
i will write

2736
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:56,120
GM crops

2737
01:52:56,120 --> 01:52:57,840
this is me

2738
01:52:57,880 --> 01:52:59,320
This was about two years ago

2739
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:00,120
then in china

2740
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:00,880
I just published

2741
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,840
I said whether machine-modified crops are the hope of Taiwan's agriculture

2742
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,280
But it must be expected

2743
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:08,040
There must be an objection soon

2744
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:11,840
Machine-modified crops still come and should be dealt with

2745
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,080
So the professor at National Taiwan University

2746
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:15,280
Academician He Danghua

2747
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:17,160
He also wrote an article

2748
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:21,680
He said that this machine-modified crop is due to rational discussion

2749
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:22,480
what is the most important

2750
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:24,880
Because we really haven't had a rational discussion

2751
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,040
Everyone is open and transparent

2752
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:29,120
The pros and cons

2753
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:30,640
discuss it

2754
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:31,680
let everyone know

2755
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:32,720
Then we choose

2756
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,440
should we do this

2757
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:37,040
You let me choose experience not to spray pesticides

2758
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:39,280
It's still a non-experienced person who doesn't spray pesticides

2759
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:42,160
I think I have to choose experience instead of spraying pesticides

2760
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:43,400
real

2761
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,840
After we understand his nature

2762
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,560
I also recently wrote an article

2763
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:52,560
That is to say, machine-modified crops are actually a political issue.

2764
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:53,240
real

2765
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:54,880
We just talked about a lot of issues

2766
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:56,920
if you scientifically

2767
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:58,000
he's not a problem

2768
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,920
But this government

2769
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,580
Between countries is often because of political factors

2770
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:06,620
So he will block his development

2771
01:54:06,620 --> 01:54:07,660
very pity

2772
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:09,340
what are the consequences of this

2773
01:54:09,940 --> 01:54:11,420
you won't let me

2774
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:12,620
look first

2775
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:15,460
Look at this anti-pest and disease-resistant words

2776
01:54:15,460 --> 01:54:17,220
You have a lot of pesticides

2777
01:54:17,220 --> 01:54:18,420
who makes money

2778
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:19,780
Pesticide companies make money

2779
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:21,020
so what

2780
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:23,740
You crop that prevents us from developing these experiences

2781
01:54:23,740 --> 01:54:26,460
You are helping the pesticide company

2782
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:27,540
anything else

2783
01:54:27,540 --> 01:54:29,460
Gold just now and you too

2784
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:32,060
2 million for experiment

2785
01:54:32,620 --> 01:54:35,220
20 million for biosafety assessment

2786
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:39,700
I have been doing it for ten years and finally found that there is no problem at all.

2787
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:42,060
really no problem at all

2788
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:43,500
but who did you help

2789
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:46,700
You helped those agbiotech companies

2790
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:49,260
The world's largest agricultural biotechnology companies

2791
01:54:49,260 --> 01:54:52,780
Because only he can afford 20 million to do it

2792
01:54:52,780 --> 01:54:54,340
biosafety assessment

2793
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:57,580
Many of our small laboratories

2794
01:54:57,580 --> 01:54:59,100
small company

2795
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
spend so much money to do this

2796
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,360
so who did you help

2797
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:05,040
You just helped the big companies

2798
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:07,000
Only he has money to do things

2799
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,400
so why now

2800
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:11,200
Make money by experience crops

2801
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:13,400
those big companies

2802
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:17,000
So this has a lot to think about

2803
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
then i have been

2804
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,720
In addition, it has been emphasized that

2805
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:22,000
why should we hurry

2806
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Actively do research

2807
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,720
Although our government does not promote

2808
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:25,520
but he

2809
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:27,520
He can still let us do research

2810
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:29,920
Guo Kewei

2811
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,320
he is really nice

2812
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:33,120
That is to say, there is still a lot of money

2813
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:34,120
let's do research

2814
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:36,520
because we really want to master

2815
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:38,520
Hold this upstream patent

2816
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:39,520
upgrade

2817
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:42,720
Our IT industry is already suffering

2818
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:45,520
There are many upstream patents that cannot be grasped

2819
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:46,720
so what

2820
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:49,520
Every hundred dollars you sell

2821
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,920
mobile phone is likely these

2822
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:53,320
like iphone

2823
01:55:53,320 --> 01:55:56,320
This Apple makes fifty bucks

2824
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:58,320
Taiwan probably only earns one or two dollars

2825
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,600
Patents are in the hands of others

2826
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:04,220
So biotechnology is the same

2827
01:56:04,220 --> 01:56:07,460
Especially the good genes of this crop now

2828
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:09,660
if you look online

2829
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:11,260
A lot of genes every day

2830
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:13,760
Patented by these biotech companies

2831
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:15,820
If we don't speed up our research

2832
01:56:15,820 --> 01:56:17,660
In the future, we will use it ourselves in Taiwan

2833
01:56:17,660 --> 01:56:20,000
You have to pay other people's money

2834
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,120
So this is a pretty stressful thing

2835
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:26,620
so why we've been active

2836
01:56:26,620 --> 01:56:28,620
doing these research and development

2837
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:32,080
In fact, many scientists around the world

2838
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:34,480
Both support this genetically modified crop

2839
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:35,720
this is just an example

2840
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:37,120
American Institute for Employment

2841
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:38,240
Royal Society

2842
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:40,320
In fact, if you look online

2843
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:45,380
There are many, many groups like this that are very supportive

2844
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:49,220
Finally I want to tell this story

2845
01:56:49,220 --> 01:56:51,100
This is January 5 this year

2846
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:53,760
Newsweek posted a message

2847
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:55,560
many people don't notice

2848
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:57,840
He posted such a photo

2849
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:05,120
Metro in Paris, France on February 15, 2011

2850
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:07,420
Photo taken at the subway station

2851
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:10,500
You see he uses this corn as a gun

2852
01:57:10,660 --> 01:57:12,260
to hit someone on the head

2853
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:14,220
So I think what he means is probably

2854
01:57:14,380 --> 01:57:15,740
I don't understand this French

2855
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:17,660
I think some students are from France

2856
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:20,100
He might understand this

2857
01:57:21,260 --> 01:57:23,180
I mean genetically modified stuff

2858
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:26,100
It seems that if you eat people, what will happen?

2859
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:27,660
what will happen if you die

2860
01:57:27,820 --> 01:57:29,580
So he put a picture like this

2861
01:57:29,900 --> 01:57:31,300
But his article

2862
01:57:31,460 --> 01:57:34,100
What is New Swick really going to talk about

2863
01:57:34,260 --> 01:57:36,060
He wants to talk about this gentleman

2864
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:38,780
Called Mark Nymus

2865
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:40,140
this mr.

2866
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:43,820
this gentleman said

2867
01:57:44,180 --> 01:57:45,500
he was surprised

2868
01:57:45,660 --> 01:57:47,860
Mr. He apologized

2869
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:49,500
sorry for what

2870
01:57:49,660 --> 01:57:52,820
for him for many years

2871
01:57:53,060 --> 01:57:56,700
Probably more than twenty years

2872
01:57:56,700 --> 01:57:59,940
Anti-gene behavior like this

2873
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,740
Everyone is surprised why

2874
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:06,600
Because he is a very famous environmentalist

2875
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:09,840
I have been anti-experience, I have been advocating

2876
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,500
Can't eat this experience

2877
01:58:12,660 --> 01:58:14,500
then he apologized

2878
01:58:14,660 --> 01:58:17,540
Then this article in this Newsweek

2879
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:22,500
He's saying experience won't be a problem for us

2880
01:58:22,660 --> 01:58:24,300
your real problem now

2881
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:26,160
where is the real crisis

2882
01:58:26,460 --> 01:58:30,960
but the minority in rich countries

2883
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:34,120
He insisted on eating very natural food

2884
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:37,360
But in the future, they will fight back because of their behavior

2885
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:41,160
You will starve many, many people around the world

2886
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:43,960
So in his article

2887
01:58:44,120 --> 01:58:46,620
This has this website here

2888
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:50,820
So the main question is to go back to what I just said

2889
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:55,120
Now the global food article is getting bigger

2890
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:57,580
And this Mark Niners

2891
01:58:57,740 --> 01:59:00,280
He's a real environmentalist

2892
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,000
He was born in Oxford, England, quite young

2893
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:08,000
he is a famous writer

2894
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
journalists and environmentalists

2895
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
I've also written many books and made movies.

2896
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,000
mostly related to issues of environmental change

2897
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:19,000
In a recent public lecture in Oxford, England, he

2898
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Publicly apologized for his anti-GN actions since the 1990s

2899
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Because he thinks that as an environmentalist

2900
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:31,000
This new technology will be mindful of the global environment

2901
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:36,000
When he first heard about Mansanto's GN soybeans

2902
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:40,000
He thinks this product will pollute food and our environment

2903
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,000
It is something that cannot be done with high technology

2904
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
what a nightmare

2905
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:49,000
So they started spreading the fear

2906
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
like wildfire

2907
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Made GN Friday almost banned in Europe within a few years

2908
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:00,000
This fear is also exported by the Calendar Peace Organization and Friends of the Earth

2909
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,640
to Africa, India, Asia

2910
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:04,600
The development of genetic organization is affected

2911
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:08,000
This Mark thinks his activity

2912
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:10,840
It's the most successful event he's ever been involved in

2913
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,200
most successful sport

2914
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:15,800
What about after 2008?

2915
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:17,240
someone asked him

2916
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:20,360
He says you're against agribiotech

2917
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:22,440
because of opposition to agribiotech companies

2918
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:24,040
you against genes

2919
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:27,640
So will you also be against big car companies?

2920
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:29,240
And against the car?

2921
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,840
So this time he started

2922
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,560
learn from science

2923
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:35,520
Causes of Environmental Change

2924
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:37,520
Meaning with experience crops

2925
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:39,720
Then his warship found

2926
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:42,400
Empirical technology can indeed solve

2927
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:46,160
Rapidly deteriorating environmental change and population issues

2928
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:50,840
Just like the issues I mentioned earlier in my speech today

2929
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:52,680
in his article

2930
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:55,720
All written into a very long article

2931
02:00:55,720 --> 02:01:00,040
So we scientifically

2932
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,400
look at this question

2933
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:04,200
Experience definitely pays off

2934
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:06,160
that to our future world

2935
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:07,120
it is needed

2936
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:09,360
it may not solve all problems

2937
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:12,520
But we don't have much choice now

2938
02:01:12,680 --> 02:01:17,600
We still have to hurry up and develop this technology

2939
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:21,080
let it provide us with safety

2940
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:24,040
Then this can protect the environment

2941
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:27,560
Then it can cope with the future population

2942
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:29,840
a very important strategy

2943
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,680
ok then i'll end up here

2944
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:34,640
I believe us scientists

2945
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:36,440
No one wants to hurt anyone

2946
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:39,680
We all want to say that based on good science

2947
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:42,200
to make the greatest contribution to mankind

2948
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:43,560
so thank you guys

2949
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:44,920
Thanks

2950
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:51,280
The first time I came to the professor to check the examination

2951
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:53,440
He's dreamed about the time

2952
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:57,080
Usually I just move on as soon as it's out

2953
02:01:57,240 --> 02:01:58,560
I am doing textbooks today

2954
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,500
our ten minute chance

2955
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:05,460
or the end of the ninety-sixty minutes

2956
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:07,400
so we ask

2957
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:14,000
I'm sorry to ask Professor Yu

2958
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,460
i ask simple questions

2959
02:02:15,460 --> 02:02:17,860
that means we buy food

2960
02:02:17,860 --> 02:02:22,000
When buying fruits and vegetables, do you buy the ones you have never eaten?

2961
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,760
It will be safer to eat like this

2962
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:25,500
Thanks

2963
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:27,800
Yes, many people will ask this question

2964
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:29,600
Of course that shows

2965
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:30,800
it is possible to show that

2966
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:32,500
Pesticides may be used less

2967
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:33,960
but how much is it really used

2968
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:36,300
I think it's still hard to say

2969
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:37,260
and then the other one is

2970
02:02:37,260 --> 02:02:38,900
We have a lot of bugs now

2971
02:02:38,900 --> 02:02:40,860
already resistant

2972
02:02:40,860 --> 02:02:42,960
So you can't kill him with spray

2973
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:46,700
so it will die

2974
02:02:46,700 --> 02:02:49,400
So it's really the best

2975
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:52,360
better i think

2976
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:54,460
Plants themselves are resistant to insects and pesticides

2977
02:02:54,460 --> 02:02:55,700
still more important

2978
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:58,100
But someone still has a potential problem

2979
02:02:58,100 --> 02:03:00,060
That is to say, sometimes these bugs

2980
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
germs it hardens

2981
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,440
So it is not easy for you to come across a good breed

2982
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:07,940
Not long after, the ingredient disease came again

2983
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:10,440
But the traditional breed is worse

2984
02:03:10,440 --> 02:03:12,840
Sometimes it takes you 10 years

2985
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:13,920
meet a species

2986
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:15,880
two or three years to come

2987
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:17,600
Came because of serious illness

2988
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:20,800
But at least we now have genetic engineering to compete with it

2989
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:21,560
race it

2990
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:22,360
see who is faster

2991
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:25,600
you get very sick and get sick fast

2992
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:27,840
I am also very fast with my genetic modification technology

2993
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:31,320
So at least we still have some strategy to follow it

2994
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:33,320
deal with it like this

2995
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:35,320
please tell me

2996
02:03:35,320 --> 02:03:38,520
When I buy soybeans, I always buy the one with the fat gene.

2997
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:41,160
Is there no need to do this anymore?

2998
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:46,560
I think there should be no need to worry about that

2999
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:48,040
because we eat a lot

3000
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:50,240
you are at home of course you can do this

3001
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:53,080
But we know that there are really many people who eat out

3002
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:55,960
What do we people who eat out eat out every day?

3003
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:57,360
really don't know

3004
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,800
Genetic soybeans are still cheaper

3005
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:07,200
So I believe that many business people will still buy that kind of

3006
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:08,000
right

3007
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:11,520
The most important thing is that he has been from 1996 to now

3008
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:13,000
It's been 16 years

3009
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,600
16 years have passed

3010
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:17,680
I believe we have many things on the market

3011
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:19,000
including a lot of medical stuff

3012
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,560
No one can guarantee 100% that there will be no problems.

3013
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:24,560
But in fact, the genetic thing is up to now

3014
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:26,520
really didn't happen a problem

3015
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:27,680
right

3016
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:29,320
grateful

3017
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:30,320
OK

3018
02:04:32,920 --> 02:04:33,920
teacher please

3019
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:37,320
How can we prevent certain

3020
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:39,320
Similar to Monsanto

3021
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:41,680
Because they're pretty notorious.

3022
02:04:41,680 --> 02:04:44,640
That is, he has a lot of varieties

3023
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:47,000
He is the one who protected himself

3024
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,080
If so

3025
02:04:48,080 --> 02:04:49,840
Countries should develop biotechnology

3026
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:52,600
also a big problem

3027
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:55,600
In fact, there are many genes

3028
02:04:55,600 --> 02:04:57,560
there are many more available

3029
02:04:57,560 --> 02:05:00,000
It's not that only the genes he used can be used

3030
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,200
So why should we all step up our research

3031
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:03,800
that's it

3032
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:04,600
But what?

3033
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:08,200
Too bad only these big companies have money

3034
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:10,600
Can be pushed from R&D to product

3035
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:12,100
he can

3036
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:15,000
Get through every level and every level like this

3037
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,600
but what about us

3038
02:05:16,700 --> 02:05:19,000
Compared with these small companies with no money

3039
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,500
small research institute

3040
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:22,100
you have to start from scratch

3041
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:23,200
It's really tough

3042
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:25,700
So the government is in terms of policy

3043
02:05:25,700 --> 02:05:26,900
on the counseling

3044
02:05:26,900 --> 02:05:29,100
still have to play an important role

3045
02:05:29,300 --> 02:05:30,500
Now the most important thing is to say

3046
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:32,900
If you know the nature of this gene

3047
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:36,100
If you don't use such strict standards

3048
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:37,100
Taiwanese

3049
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:38,900
genetic criteria

3050
02:05:38,900 --> 02:05:41,300
I think it is almost the strictest in the world now

3051
02:05:41,900 --> 02:05:42,500
real

3052
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:43,400
Now

3053
02:05:43,900 --> 02:05:45,900
In fact, everything in Taiwan depends on Japan

3054
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:47,500
why did we go

3055
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:49,500
It seems that everyone has an excuse

3056
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:51,600
Talk about our rice in Taiwan or something

3057
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:52,900
Can't have genes

3058
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:54,400
Because we sell it to Japan

3059
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:57,300
Japan will not buy it or something

3060
02:05:57,300 --> 02:05:59,400
you in that papaya

3061
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,080
Prof. Yi Xidong from Taiwan's famous Sino-British University

3062
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:04,960
antiviral papaya

3063
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:07,920
After he developed more than ten years ago

3064
02:06:08,420 --> 02:06:12,360
At that time, papayas in Taiwan were almost extinct.

3065
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:14,280
only later to the east

3066
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:15,840
Because of the barrier of important mountains

3067
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:17,160
can also hit a little bit

3068
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:18,640
but later

3069
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:24,120
Teacher Ye's Hard Papaya

3070
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:26,320
Field experiment conducted by Zhongzai Agriculture

3071
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:29,760
The farmer saw that his papaya was growing well

3072
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:31,880
All other papayas are dead, only he is good

3073
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:33,080
stole the seeds

3074
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:35,920
then go back to plant

3075
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:38,840
So a few years ago Zhao Yongqing legislator

3076
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:42,000
I still remember to ask

3077
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,920
He said why Taiwan now heard that the test

3078
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:47,640
One-third to one-quarter of papayas are

3079
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:49,360
GM's might be even higher

3080
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:52,040
because almost for a while

3081
02:06:52,040 --> 02:06:53,920
Now we have papaya because

3082
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:55,760
Article scraping relationship

3083
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:59,960
So his GM papaya farmer went planting

3084
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:04,600
Then, don’t many of our farmers go to the mainland to grow agricultural products?

3085
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:07,900
So he brought his chicken papaya to the mainland to plant

3086
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:11,140
Then Mr. Ye went to Hainan Island

3087
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:13,560
He went to the supermarket to buy a papaya

3088
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:14,940
dig out the seeds

3089
02:07:14,940 --> 02:07:17,040
Go to a supermarket in Beijing for a meeting

3090
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:20,100
He bought another papaya and dug up that seed

3091
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:23,740
When he came back to Taiwan and checked, it was his papaya

3092
02:07:23,740 --> 02:07:25,360
Hehehe

3093
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:27,660
So the mainland is already eating everywhere

3094
02:07:27,660 --> 02:07:33,300
Then Hawaii developed at about the same time as him

3095
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:36,500
Genetically engineered papayas are also virus-resistant

3096
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:39,100
It has been commercialized for ten years

3097
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:43,000
As for Taiwan, he is constantly being suppressed and blocked.

3098
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,060
Then our chairman of the Agricultural Committee said

3099
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:48,200
look at this

3100
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:51,940
This is because Japanese papayas are all from Hawaii

3101
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:53,940
for export

3102
02:07:53,940 --> 02:07:57,440
He said you see Japanese people don't even eat Hawaiian papayas

3103
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:59,940
So how about this, we cannot develop in Taiwan

3104
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,240
so really for a while

3105
02:08:02,240 --> 02:08:05,440
Hawaii had to be special for Japan

3106
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:06,960
Because he has many islands

3107
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:09,400
So on the island he has, he specially planted this

3108
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:10,680
Airplane colorful papaya

3109
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:12,760
Export to Japan, right?

3110
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:15,120
But the September of the previous year

3111
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:18,200
Japan has passed the import

3112
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:21,160
Hawaii's genetically modified papaya

3113
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:24,840
Our papaya is still pressed there

3114
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:28,240
Biotechnology is actually progressing very fast

3115
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:30,280
everyone is competing

3116
02:08:30,280 --> 02:08:32,360
We are often treated like this by the government

3117
02:08:32,360 --> 02:08:34,000
After pressing down

3118
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:37,560
Our competitiveness is lost

3119
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:41,640
So this genetic thing

3120
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:44,520
This big company has his deep pockets

3121
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:47,520
But also because of the help of environmental groups

3122
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:50,480
So it is still only the big companies that can

3123
02:08:50,480 --> 02:08:51,840
able to dominate the market

3124
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Thanks

3125
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,000
During GM, we should talk about native species of biodiversity

3126
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:12,000
How can we find this balance

3127
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:16,000
i want biodiverse people

3128
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Of course, I hope to be able to find things in nature

3129
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,000
don't change too much

3130
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
But I just mentioned that many

3131
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,000
In fact, it keeps changing

3132
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:31,000
We humans add some genes to this crop

3133
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Then we're between different balances

3134
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,000
exchange it

3135
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:38,000
In fact, we are promoting diversity

3136
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
So it's not reducing diversity

3137
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Instead, it promotes diversity

3138
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,000
This human looks like this

3139
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:48,000
This creature has evolved over the years

3140
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,000
In fact, many processes

3141
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Of course not anytime soon

3142
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
it's been a long time

3143
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Our humans are just speeding it up now

3144
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,000
In fact, there are many things in nature

3145
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
it's been happening

3146
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Then I think if the population is not increasing so fast

3147
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:10,000
If it weren't for the fact that our environment has been deteriorating

3148
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:13,000
We don't necessarily have to develop experiential stuff either.

3149
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:16,000
But now I think the most important thing is that the population growth rate is too fast

3150
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Then pesticide use has a lot

3151
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:25,000
The cost for farmers to follow the crowd has been rising

3152
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
So there are many kinds of problems

3153
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Let's not face problems like this

3154
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
I think if you can not

3155
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
we better not do

3156
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
yes

3157
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,000
well the time has come

3158
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
we thank the hospital today

3159
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,000
thank you

3160
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Thanks

3161
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Thanks
