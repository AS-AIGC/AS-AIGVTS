At the popular science lecture held by the Academia Sinica in 2023, Wang Zhiming, an associate researcher at the European and American Institute, shared a special speech on power, freedom and dignity with the theme of refugees. The speech discussed the issue of refugee documents, the plight of Afghan refugees and human rights protection laws, and borrowed literature perspectives such as the experience of Vietnamese refugees and books on North Korean refugees to remind everyone to respect the dignity of refugees and the right to pursue freedom. The speaker called for an in-depth investigation of the concept of immigration and caring for refugees, to enhance Taiwan's discussions and actions on refugee issues, and ultimately look forward to combining academic research and practical actions to promote social harmony. This film mainly discusses the refugee issue, analyzes the differences in European attitudes towards different refugee issues, emphasizes the need for more cooperation between the academic and food circles, and pays attention to ethics and morality. When faced with issues such as terrorist attacks, viewers are encouraged to think about the reasons behind the events rather than focusing on specific identities. In addition, the film refers to the differences in the situation of refugees in Europe, the Americas and Asia, and explores issues related to refugee identity and transnational migration. Finally, the speaker called for understanding the real situation of refugees and respecting the special situation of each country. ,
