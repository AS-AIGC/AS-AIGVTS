00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,540
yes

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Is there abalone in it at night?

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No! What a pity!

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Very important!

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
indeed a prize

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I believe this time is no exception

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
this time our

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The main prize is Chen Zhiyi

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Dr. Chen Zhiyi

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He is a cell of the Chinese Academy

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
individual organisms

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
researcher at the Institute of

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
is in

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Culture University's Department of Oceanography Biology Group

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
get a bachelor's degree

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
later in Taiwan

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The joy of National Taiwan University

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Institute of Science for a Master's Degree

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Then at National Taiwan University

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
graduate School

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,560
It is a unit in the School of Life Sciences

35
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,900
get a doctorate

36
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,680
Then he went to a very famous research institute in the UK

37
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,960
Call the Sanger Institute

38
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,560
Sanger won the Nobel Prize

39
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,640
for DNA sequencing

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,360
the researcher who won the nobel prize

41
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,720
the scholar

42
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,000
He is his Institute

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And in 2003 to the Institute of Zoology of Central Plains Institute

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,400
This institute is now

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,200
Cell Individual Biology Institute

46
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,800
Working at Linhai Research Station

47
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,400
Now a researcher at that institute

48
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,800
Dr Chen has studied marine life for many years

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,200
Antibacterial ecology

50
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,800
that's his topic today

51
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,400
Fluorescence

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,200
admiring the earth

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
do research and development work

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't know if today will be better than these few

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's a very sad hope

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Maybe

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
In the future, you can also get from him

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Learn more about this very wronged one

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
the result of his research and development

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
then he

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Dr. Chen

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
won many awards

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
include

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Academician Yang Jiangfa

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Outstanding Young Scholar Award in Agricultural Sciences

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
in the National Innovation Awards

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
he also used to be

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Director of Taiwan Society of Marine Biotechnology

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
OK, then we give warm applause

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
welcome thank you dr chen

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Thank you Vice President for your report

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Today is

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The first knowledge missing in the end of the year

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
first knowledge miss

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm here to say goodbye to everyone

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Hope you all have a happy new year and all the best

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thank you all very much for coming here tonight to listen to knowledge miss

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,720
There is what I talked about eating fish today but not

79
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,340
Antimicrobial status of fish could be cancer-fighting

80
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,340
or antimicrobial psychotropic drugs

81
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,840
then i will be silent

82
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
I am from Jiao Township, Yilan County

83
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,340
We have a forest sea research station over there

84
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,640
Generally, you may be unfamiliar with the Linhai Research Station

85
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,340
But wait a minute we have a few eras

86
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,840
Let me introduce you to the Linhai Research Station

87
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,740
then i just

88
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,040
I was just outside and the deputy dean asked everyone a question

89
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,540
Tell me, have you eaten any fish tonight?

90
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,040
that's okay

91
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,640
I asked everyone if you have eaten fish like this today

92
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,680
I think Yilan County is becoming more and more important

93
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,680
a source of food

94
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,680
Especially now that everyone pays attention to health preservation

95
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
And recently there is love flu

96
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,680
killed a bunch of geese

97
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,840
killed a bunch of chickens

98
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,520
pressure age

99
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
I can't tell the difference between the ear and the ear

100
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Then the best way is to eat fish

101
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,180
So the topic I'm talking about today

102
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,180
I hope everyone will go back in the future

103
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,980
can eat more fish

104
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,480
Then help our water mountain farming industry in Taiwan

105
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,480
can develop with us

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,200
Then we can produce more relevant research output in our marine biotechnology

107
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,840
To take care of everyone's fasting on the food measurement

108
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,200
Alright, so today we are going to talk about what is called the anti-ying platform

109
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,320
That is, the anti-ying platform is a very interesting thing

110
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,720
Let me tell you first, ask if you eat fish

111
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,480
I think everyone must have seen these kinds of fish in the vegetable market

112
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,240
Except for this fish, everyone may be unfamiliar

113
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,160
Everyone must have seen grouper

114
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,320
Yes, everyone has seen black abalone, right?

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,320
when i went to the market

116
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,120
My mother buys black abalone or buys these fish

117
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,520
he must tell me

118
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,960
That salmon wheel, that wheel isn't good

119
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,720
right, is that so

120
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,960
So put the salmon wheel in the case of the wheel

121
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,800
Why is this fish sick?

122
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,760
may have been ill before his death

123
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,280
The sickness is in the aquatic oxygen body

124
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,600
Fish diseases are somewhat similar to human diseases

125
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,320
Then this black abalone and this fish like flounder

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm going to report to you now

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Because I first write the names of these anti-Philippine sellers here

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
because everyone can know

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's wait and we'll introduce these protagonists to you

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We translate it into EBCD

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Because its English name is EBCD1

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Its content is to hope that everyone can see the anti-Philippine sales

133
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
know that it will give B to E in the future

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So I translated it into this Chinese

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
on top of the turtle fish

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is our common Niroka turtle fish

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
that turtle fish

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's Moshan Piccolo Turtle Fish

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
They all have different anti-Philippines

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
name sold against philippines

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
will have different names for different fish species

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But because of its structure in different fish

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
is also different

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Each anti-philippine is sold on a variety of different fish

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
it will have different functions

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll report back to you later

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Now let me tell you an interesting story

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Why do we have to tell the story of Shui Shanyang

149
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I ran away to make a cup of wine.

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm going to report to you now

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Nashuishanyang is the farming industry of grouper

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,300
Taiwan's aquaculture aquaculture is very meticulous

153
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,300
you may not know

154
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,600
Usually we may take the car to the maintenance shop

155
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
A master can do a lot

156
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Let's say we go to the Ford service shop

157
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,100
This master who may receive you

158
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,900
The whole car can be refueled and maintained

159
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,900
But not in the year of the aquaculture industry

160
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,400
each different region

161
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,600
every different period

162
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,000
it will have different breeders

163
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,300
Or breeding professionals to do farming work

164
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,300
In this picture, let me tell you

165
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,300
This is a grouper breeding process

166
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,800
grouper it has what is called inch seconds

167
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,100
Of course at different times

168
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,100
For example, this time only the time to eat mosquitoes

169
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
Or the time to eat bee-snapped shrimp

170
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,600
in different periods

171
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,600
They all have different bacterial infections

172
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,400
or viral infection

173
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,600
For example, the grouper mainly has many

174
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
neurochemotherapy virus

175
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,300
or have many bacterial infections

176
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
e.g. fungal infection

177
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,300
or so-called intense infection

178
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,100
or other infections such as pointworm

179
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,900
The lethality of these infections

180
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,900
In fact, some have reached the so-called 100% fatality rate

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Wait a minute and I will report a Hu Jun to everyone

182
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
A Hu Jun made in our laboratory

183
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,720
This Hu Jun is my last from college

184
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Obtained by Mr. Chen Junyao's laboratory

185
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,000
This Hu Jun is very interesting

186
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You may not believe that we are sick

187
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,600
we are sick

188
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,320
live in hospital

189
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,820
The hospital may also give you first aid and antibiotic treatment

190
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,320
come soon

191
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,920
I'll talk about the proxy certificate later

192
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,000
or acute

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Acute pharmacology certificate

194
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Maybe in about a week, people's lives will be goodbye

195
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But do you believe it?

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
From our discovery of infection

197
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
People who may have raised fish before could not understand

198
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
how did this fish die

199
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But he found that within 24 hours the fish in the whole area

200
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
all will die for you

201
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Then die and show you later

202
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
you may see

203
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
some fish just cuddle fish

204
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
ok

205
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
we'll talk next

206
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
When I went to Linghai Research Station

207
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
When I first went to Linghai Research Station

208
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There is an interesting story that

209
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We hope that at Linghai Research Station

210
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Some are the same as Taiwan carry

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
A job that can assist Taiwan's water mountain farming industry

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Because everyone eats fish like everyone sees

213
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
have many emotions

214
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
that duck or goose will die

215
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
no robin dies

216
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
so at that time

217
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Director Guo Qingyin will tell me one thing

218
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
what he wishes to be able to do

219
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
make an early morning thing

220
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Able to assist Taiwan's water mountain farming industry

221
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The problem of allowing illness

222
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Then I wanted to say

223
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
how do i solve it

224
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What kinds of infections?

225
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
virus infection at that time

226
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
In my press release called The Laboratory of Inorganic Therapy

227
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
have done well

228
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
i think i do virus infection maybe

229
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So I think

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Bacterial infection may be a very interesting thing

231
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Because bacteria can kill invisible

232
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But it is possible to use a

233
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
a tiny bacterium

234
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
it allows fish

235
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
or cause disease in living things

236
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's a disease Hu Jun got

237
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's a picture taken from the internet

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
in the grouper or stack

239
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
or Elephant Gauge

240
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You can see when Hu Jun is infected

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
In case of swelling

242
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,680
In fact, this is because when the later outbreak

243
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
it inhales and reproduces in large numbers

244
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,280
lots of splits

245
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,280
Then such a sudden illness occurs in Su Ni

246
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,080
we help

247
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,080
in case of acute illness

248
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,800
just to give medicine

249
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,160
From the concept of farming

250
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,200
For example, I went to university from inside

251
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,920
The concept of farming in those days

252
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,760
In fact, we were raising grass shrimp at that time

253
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,080
or raise some fish

254
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,080
you may not know

255
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,080
in their farming industry

256
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,360
all in cash

257
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,880
at that time in university

258
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,520
Just go to the aquaculture area to implement

259
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,160
When I went there to see how people raise fish

260
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,880
I just discovered aquarium farming later

261
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,680
It's a very shallow industry

262
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
but

263
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,960
at that moment

264
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,160
What to do if the fish is sick

265
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,960
as I just reported to you

266
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,160
one night

267
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,080
if all you raise

268
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,880
All 10,000 silky fish are fighting

269
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,760
look

270
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,160
Then you don't feel very

271
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,720
very frustrated

272
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
those fish

273
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,480
if not dying

274
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,960
before you die

275
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
because what will do ? drug

276
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What is drugging?

277
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Just give some chemicals or antibiotics

278
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
to treat these infections

279
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
bacterial infection

280
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Let me introduce to you first

281
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
aquaculture once upon a time

282
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Chemical reagents commonly used in the past

283
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
For example, peacock eating worry

284
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
or antibiotics

285
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
For example, this antibiotic

286
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
N-O killing heart

287
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It is a medicine for animals

288
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
These things will be mixed in the ingredients

289
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
forehead

290
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Then you go to therapy for five days

291
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
your fish will be fine

292
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Why is it good? For example, peacock eats worry

293
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Klebsiella spp

294
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
many different bacteria

295
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It has a bactericidal effect

296
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
but

297
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
everyone knows

298
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
these things will

299
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
coping with the food chain

300
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
let everyone see

301
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
horseshoe perch

302
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Very shiny fish eaten into the stomach

303
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
These things will also eat into your stomach

304
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
so

305
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So what's going on? Bacteria in the natural environment

306
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So-called drug resistance and limited drug production

307
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
These two things deeply affect what we will talk about later

308
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Why? Because bacteria it mutates

309
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
it will survive

310
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Just like us human beings also in order to survive

311
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
we will work very hard

312
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
work hard

313
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Bacteria will also work very hard

314
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
survive

315
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
When a drug develops a resistance or drug miscarriage

316
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
in this natural environment

317
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
we're in big trouble

318
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Because of the relationship through the food chain

319
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
will enter the human body

320
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Let's talk about sex

321
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
CGMP medicines

322
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
it has a product called mecon cream

323
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Everyone probably used it

324
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
In the medicine on the Department of Human Medicine

325
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You can see that it's all made of antibiotics.

326
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
For example, Neumicin

327
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
this drug

328
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You can see it's all clearly written

329
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
now you go inside the pharmacy

330
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
when buying any medicine

331
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
They will all be in the drug

332
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
on the trick table

333
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
will be detailed in the form

334
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
what are these drugs for

335
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
it will also tell you about its sex

336
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What are the indications

337
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
He will also adopt what is his potency

338
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Do you think that these antibiotics are really magic medicines after seeing these effects?

339
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So when I was a kid I thought antibiotics were really the magic drug

340
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Because it can treat many diseases

341
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
lots of bacterial infections

342
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Whether you are accidentally tired today

343
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and you have a hole in your leg

344
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And then accidentally turned into a bacterial infection

345
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Whether you have any bacterial infection

346
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I just need a little antibiotic

347
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This wound will heal and it won't continue to thicken.

348
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I believe everyone has this experience

349
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
what this experience brings

350
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Here's some interesting news I stumbled from the internet

351
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Antibiotic Resistance Deaths from Antibiotic Resistance

352
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
For example, on February 3, 2017

353
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm talking about hygrobacteria

354
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Hungry hygrobacterium turns into a superbug

355
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Antibiotic resistance may develop

356
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,760
It turned out to be in 2050

357
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,360
Died of antibiotic resistance

358
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
There are about 4.7 million people in Asia

359
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,360
Now that's not me too sensational

360
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,500
Everyone may still live here

361
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,600
Everyone is very healthy

362
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,860
no cough

363
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,500
and no pain

364
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,060
So everyone thinks that the drug resistance is far away from me.

365
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,960
That's not my business

366
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,700
But it appears in all the data

367
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,360
wait a minute i'll tell you something

368
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,660
Finally I have an era

369
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,420
I will tell you guys that a recent post was interesting

370
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,020
your puppy

371
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,560
inside dog poop

372
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,120
0.6%

373
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,120
Xu Xun production containing drug resistance

374
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,720
wait a minute i'll let you know

375
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,220
What a terrible thing drug-resistant Xu Xun is

376
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,120
Although now we still have a magic medicine to cure us

377
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,920
But will there be no magic medicine to save us in the future?

378
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,420
Will there be other alternatives to replace antibiotics?

379
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,480
This is the first question we want to ask

380
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,200
can report to everyone

381
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Indiscriminate use of antimicrobial bacteria in the prelude is becoming more and more serious

382
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,700
So human beings' practical meat is centrally victimized

383
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,600
This is an article published on the news in 2015

384
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,800
There was a funny thing when I was a kid

385
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,500
Because when I was a child, my family had pigs

386
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,800
i remember as long as i can remember

387
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
because my father worked in a sugar factory

388
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,400
So the income from working in the sugar factory should not be very high

389
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,300
So my dad helped raise the pigs

390
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,600
We have pigs next door to our house

391
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,800
next to our house

392
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,200
I remember when I was a child there was a thing called Orofi

393
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,700
Roof

394
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,200
do you all know

395
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,700
It can be seen that we are about the same age

396
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,700
This Orofi is fun

397
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,800
everyone should know

398
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,900
Sometimes kids don't eat

399
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,200
or eating fatter

400
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,000
You eat Orofi big

401
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,200
we were like this when we were kids

402
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,100
When I was in elementary school, sometimes my friends would say

403
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
You eat Orofi

404
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,680
Later, when I grew up, I found out

405
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,640
Olby is not such an interesting thing

406
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,040
why olby

407
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,920
What about Alfa?

408
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,480
It is an additive to medicated feed

409
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,160
At the same time, he was the section chief of Huangjianyu Drug Management Section in Ouerhui

410
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,760
Xian Zhongfa pointed out

411
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,280
It is an antibiotic that has been added to the feed in low amounts for a long time

412
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,080
It is easy to make the bacteria in the intestinal tract of animals resistant to antibiotics

413
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,480
this troublesome one

414
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,160
It Olbi was originally created to heal

415
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,840
for the treatment of bacterial infections

416
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,240
Because pigs stand up easily

417
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,040
It is during the pig's growth period

418
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,360
it is easy to stand

419
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,120
Then there will be a bacterial infection causing it to stand down

420
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,760
At this time, drug-resistant bacteria will develop

421
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,280
So if you are using low volume

422
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,040
Then the long-term low volume has been

423
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,720
What will be added to the feed

424
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,520
produce resistant bacteria

425
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,880
The other one is the National Institutes of Health

426
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,120
his sui researcher

427
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,640
Specific Researcher also speaks

428
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,640
In fact, our animal husbandry uses antibiotics indiscriminately

429
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,280
meat safety

430
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,200
Maybe it will follow the black heart

431
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,000
Taiwan three

432
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
a big real question

433
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Wait a minute and I will too

434
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I will also report to you

435
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Don't talk about Taiwan

436
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Let me report to everyone, I think the situation in mainland China is more troublesome than yours

437
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Mainland I believe they don't use antibiotics

438
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
mainland pork

439
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Pork in mainland China until now

440
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
some are imported

441
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Because some of them raise pigs in the country

442
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Information on antibiotics may also be used

443
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I think antibiotics are in mainland China

444
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
in Taiwan or in Southeast Asian countries

445
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Cases that should abound

446
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
then let's talk about it

447
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
antibiotic

448
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Why These Bacteria Become Drug-Resistant

449
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Because for example, this is a very simple

450
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
From a very simple graph

451
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Because this bacterium if

452
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
If the bacteria become resistant

453
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
it goes through beef cattle or pigs or chickens

454
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
after eating

455
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's antibiotics, it can't kill the bacteria with the yellow dot

456
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So this resistant bacterium

457
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
still remain in

458
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
then it passes through feces

459
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
if there is any food

460
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You can eat it later

461
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
After people step on these resolutions or implement

462
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
the drug-resistant bacteria with these yellow dots

463
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
remain in the human body

464
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So what kind of impact does this have? Is it sick?

465
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So when a bacterial infection

466
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
When we humans have so-called drug-resistant bacterial infections

467
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
On the back of the medical treatment on the clinical

468
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
is very tricky

469
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Especially in doctors they have to prescribe some appropriate antibiotics

470
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
when appropriate antibiotics

471
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's actually very, very tricky.

472
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
When I want to tell you this list

473
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
This is called a post-antibiotic era

474
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
In this book in 2013

475
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Tell us that green plum trees were born in 1928

476
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Green plum tree is actually a very interesting story

477
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The green plum tree is the stock crops raised in a pile

478
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It has a fungus that fell into it

479
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Then he found that around the fungus

480
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Every bacterium is surrounded by prison

481
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Then there is no inferior growth in the vicinity

482
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Then after floating for a year, I feel

483
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
it's a lot of fun

484
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
very interesting phenomenon

485
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
to develop a drug

486
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Then we can see that from 19%

487
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,340
From 1987 to the present, from 2011 to the present

488
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,340
We don't have so-called new antibiotics

489
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,720
Until 2014, 2015

490
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,540
There is a drug that has been approved by the US FDA

491
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,900
Approved for marketing, recently there is another antibiotic approved for marketing

492
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,660
so

493
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,200
until so many years

494
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,020
In fact, none of us have the so-called new antibiotics.

495
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,580
The development of these antibiotics since the beginning of mankind

496
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,420
The period from 1928 to 1987 was the peak period of antibiotics

497
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,460
When humans discovered these antibiotics

498
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,800
Antibiotics are also booming most during this time

499
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,900
This period of time also created the history of human health

500
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,940
best brilliant stage

501
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,720
this stage

502
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,060
As soon as any anti-suspended bacteria come out, they will be eliminated by the following drugs

503
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,600
kill it

504
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:53,000
So you can see that in 1928, seven or eight years of antibiotics were produced, in 1945, four or five years of antibiotics were produced, and in 1979, another antibiotic was produced

505
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,020
these things

506
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,060
Dongying suppressed the so-called

507
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,380
broad-spectrum resistance

508
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,140
Antibiotic Bacteria

509
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,600
So what we're going to say next, this is what I just reported to you

510
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,660
In 2014, naturally...

511
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,360
There is a journal called Nature Biotechnology

512
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,560
One biotechnology inside Nature, one inside a journal

513
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,360
October 2014, it has an interesting story

514
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,520
A description, it says US FDA

515
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,800
is what we know as the FDA

516
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,400
It makes a drug, the drug can be approved for marketing

517
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,000
This is a new type of antibiotic

518
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,400
It's presumably in IV mode, it hits the vein

519
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,200
Then prevent some of the bacteria that MSA infects

520
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,200
It's a troublesome bacterium, the bacterial infection of MSA

521
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,560
At the same time, a year earlier, in 2013,

522
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,760
Someone started talking about antimicrobial status coming back

523
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,360
Should we be looking for a new anti...

524
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,160
an antibacterial substance other than antibiotics

525
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,120
So in the 2013 Nature Journal of Biotechnology in the Nature Journal

526
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
He mentioned a report that said

527
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Antibacterial

528
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Come back and do some research

529
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Is it possible as a new type of

530
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
new antimicrobial substances

531
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Therefore, the antibacterial state research has probably been

532
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
twenty years, twenty or thirty years

533
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Probably more intensive research

534
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
There are now more than 350,000 papers

535
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
are published in some related journals

536
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
so we feel

537
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We just reported to you

538
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
there are many struggles

539
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
the consequences of the impact

540
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
leads us to want to find a new

541
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
substance that replaces the number of struggles

542
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Otherwise, there will be no medicine for human beings in the future

543
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
when there is no medical treatment

544
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And with that comes a lot of death

545
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
as the epic of yan said

546
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Birth of the Black Death

547
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
on top of some of the history we know

548
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Alright, so we're going to report to you

549
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
what is antibacterial state

550
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The origin of the antibacterial state is actually what I just reported to you

551
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
In 1928, the so-called panlucillin was produced

552
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
In 1939 there was the so-called

553
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Production of short-susceptible bacterium

554
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,760
In the 1950s, everyone had the so-called anti-halo

555
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,860
Some people began to discover the so-called anti-halo state

556
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,760
So far we probably know

557
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,060
Antibiotics that may appear to be able to replace antibiotics

558
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,200
is able to serve as a cancer treatment drug

559
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,100
The latest research results

560
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,100
we haven't

561
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,060
We only have some verification on the so-called animal experiments

562
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,360
But we believe in the future of halo resistance

563
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,560
Appears to be a replacement for antibiotics

564
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,460
a new substance

565
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,060
Next I will talk about some of our laboratory

566
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,660
Report the results of the research and development

567
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,620
Why Antisickness Could Be an Emerging Drug in the Future

568
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,360
Why anti-halostates have the power to replace antibiotics

569
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,560
Why anti-halostate may be used as an emerging anti-cancer drug in the future

570
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,860
you probably don't know

571
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,360
One of the newest emerging cancer drugs is called PDL1

572
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,160
PDL1 I just recently found out

573
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,720
it is a very expensive drug

574
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,360
A course of treatment should be done 24 times

575
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,060
For each course of treatment, do you want to guess how many times it has?

576
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,500
244 after a course of treatment

577
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,640
you probably know

578
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,940
PDL1 this latest

579
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,440
anticancer drugs

580
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,940
Do you know how much it costs?

581
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,240
100

582
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,840
Nope

583
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,840
I only recently found out

584
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,940
3000000

585
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:17,840
right

586
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,140
I

587
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,940
I'm scared to death

588
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,440
I was scared to death when I heard that number

589
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,540
so why do we want

590
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,940
Want to find an up-to-date drug production

591
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,280
just hope we will

592
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,980
we can in taiwan

593
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,280
find out find out from deep water creatures

594
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Our own Niche in Taiwan

595
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,680
You see, Taiwan is surrounded by the sea

596
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,480
So Taiwan's marine biotechnology research

597
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,480
Won't

598
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
will not alienate other countries

599
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,980
We should pay more attention to the marine life

600
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,980
get the natural resources we need

601
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,980
then later

602
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,240
Transform back to what we want to introduce to you

603
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,480
anti-pregnancy

604
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,180
Anti-pregnancy is actually basically it

605
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,920
Probably divided into several types in terms of shape

606
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,700
Then its type has the so-called spiral

607
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,800
Or a shape similar to a board

608
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,400
or a shape with specific amino acids

609
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,000
That's one of the anti-rhyme patterns we listed.

610
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That anti-rhyme, it will have plants and animals in all animals

611
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,600
including in your body

612
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,000
The human body also has the so-called anti-rhyme fetus

613
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,600
There is a so-called anti-rhyme tire in the body of the fish

614
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,500
The anti-rhyme substance is like the eggs you have eaten

615
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,500
You all know that eggs contain a lot of protein, right?

616
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,700
But the ecology is relatively small

617
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,100
small molecules smaller than proteins

618
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,900
Only about 20 amino acids to 50 amino acids

619
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,500
Smaller anti-rhyme tires are now reported

620
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,000
About 5 to 10 amino acids have antibacterial ability

621
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,300
So our family just reported that

622
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,800
Anti-rhyme tires actually exist in all nature

623
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,000
Including puppies and cats in your home

624
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,700
piggy too

625
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,800
Okay, let's also tell you about anti-rhythm tires, which can kill a lot of bacteria.

626
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
It can be verified experimentally

627
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Anti rhyme can kill bacteria

628
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Needles, protozoa, and cancer

629
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,600
It can also have what is called immune regulation

630
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,000
wait a minute i tell you

631
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,300
You all may not know one thing

632
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,000
maybe know something

633
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,400
when we catch a cold

634
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,600
When we have a bacterial infection when we are injured

635
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,100
you will hurt, right?

636
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,400
Will everyone be in pain?

637
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,000
like sometimes when my mother is sick

638
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,800
very painful

639
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,000
Tell me every day that she has back pain

640
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,600
or which side hurts

641
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,400
do you know why it hurts

642
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,300
Pain is due to bacterial infection

643
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,600
Cause immune inflammation, increase immune factors

644
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,300
but you know

645
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,300
you bring

646
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Sometimes we most often hear a sentence that is

647
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,900
The child goes to the hospital

648
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,000
what is a good doctor

649
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,100
A good doctor is to prevent children from crying

650
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,600
Take an iron medicine now

651
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,800
take medicine for a day

652
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,400
The grandson won't cry if he hugs him back

653
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,200
Then grandpa and grandma said

654
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
this doctor give me doctor

655
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,400
so that's not going to be good

656
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:56,900
is it interesting

657
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,900
yes it's interesting let me tell you

658
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,000
now have some medicine

659
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
so-called steroids

660
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What are steroid drugs for?

661
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
some steroid medicines

662
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It suppresses your immune inflammatory response

663
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
when our human body

664
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
When we humans suffer from bacterial infection

665
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
The most likely to happen is the immune system

666
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
it will start to raise

667
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
The immune system seems to have some immune genes

668
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Will be sequenced to produce some cytokines

669
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
or the production of immune factors

670
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It's time to induce your body

671
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
giant cells or intermediate leukocytes

672
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
to phagocytize the bacteria washed in

673
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But sometimes a good doctor

674
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Of course, there are fewer such good doctors now.

675
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I guess again

676
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But because of the request of the family

677
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Grandpa and grandma's request or parent's request

678
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Said that today I grow very thin

679
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
i slept all day in my sister ok

680
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
This doctor is better

681
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
After taking the medicine for a day, my sister will not be well

682
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
so this doctor is good

683
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
He gave you some steroids

684
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Steroids reduce pain

685
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,900
it's very good, but i feel like i have to say

686
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,260
Steroids are the magic drug I've known since

687
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,600
other than antibiotics

688
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,500
it keeps you from pain

689
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,200
Then do you know that every system is reduced

690
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,300
For example, when your original bacteria are cleaned

691
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,900
There are giant bubbles with four intermediate white bacteria

692
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,700
It's going to devour the bacteria in your light body

693
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,700
As a result, each system has a reduced

694
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,100
it suppresses your immunity

695
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,100
What does that bring?

696
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,500
what about these bacteria

697
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,100
flourishing

698
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:33,400
Because there is no army to kill these bacteria

699
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,900
that without killing

700
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,900
Bacteria are of course happy to produce

701
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,900
Then the doctor will definitely use

702
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,100
How many things are prescribed in your medicine

703
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,300
antibiotic

704
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,900
It's two sides of the same thing, right?

705
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,100
You have suppressed your immunity

706
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,500
Bacteria proliferate

707
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,100
Then this person won't hang you up

708
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,300
You say it's possible or impossible?

709
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,200
when bacteria are about to go up

710
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,900
It gives you antibiotics to kill the bacteria

711
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So basically in many drugs

712
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,440
The doctor will prescribe these two drugs together

713
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,680
Let you not be in pain and get well again

714
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,000
so it's a vicious cycle

715
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,840
Begins to generate endless nightmares

716
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,640
I want to report to everyone that is

717
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,840
fighting it has an advantage

718
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,840
It inhibits the production of some inflammatory factors

719
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,740
So it has what's called immune regulation

720
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,640
But it also has the ability to kill bacteria

721
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,500
Unlike what I just reported to you

722
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,060
You must take two medicines

723
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,260
Now if it can really become medicine

724
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,400
You only need to eat one

725
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,460
wait a minute you will ask me

726
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,660
Is there any resistance to anti-morbidity?

727
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,900
i will tell you

728
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,760
Is there a question of drug resistance?

729
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,660
So everyone should be curious and ask me

730
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,060
until now

731
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,500
Has the world's anti-morbidity been made into medicine?

732
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,260
Because I saw someone on B said

733
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,660
Has this medicine come out?

734
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,100
Is there any medicine

735
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,500
Who is this shoot

736
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,260
There is not yet any anti-morbid drug

737
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,660
have been used clinically

738
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,260
be industrialized commercialized

739
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,760
but there are many drugs

740
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,920
Has entered clinical phase II or III

741
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,240
even like this drug is done

742
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,500
That's for diabetes

743
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,140
What about diabetic patients?

744
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,580
he sometimes has wounds

745
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,980
big wound

746
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,240
Because everyone is still full

747
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,280
So I'm sticking that picture over here

748
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,480
Everyone is interested to see

749
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,740
i don't want to put that picture

750
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,420
Wait a minute everyone is throwing up over here

751
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,080
What about the other one?

752
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,240
and catheter

753
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,280
You may not have experience

754
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,580
It hurts to eat that catheter

755
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,480
But sometimes when the catheter is full, the urine bag comes out

756
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,640
when urine flushes back

757
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,600
It's easy to get bacteria over there

758
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,340
So what about the catheter thing?

759
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,600
Many people have been making anti-smoke soup

760
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,700
and then do some

761
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,100
in some

762
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,040
put some anti-smoke soup on the catheter

763
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,500
make it sterilizable

764
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,700
Candida infection

765
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,600
for example

766
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,500
sometimes

767
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,900
Your mouth and tongue will be white

768
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,440
that resembles a bacterial infection

769
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,380
Then everyone can brush it out with any toothbrush

770
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,340
mouth smelly today

771
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,500
Because the teeth are not brushed well

772
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,000
But in fact, after brushing it ten times and twenty times, it still smells bad.

773
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,760
because there is no mobile phone

774
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,560
It's sort of a pregnancy infection because the white layer is over there

775
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:09,480
This is the so-called roller fungus infection, so some people put the anti-smoke form in the empty water for brushing their teeth before doing research and development.

776
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:16,380
All kinds of these anti-smoke states are in the data we compiled in 2015, we probably know that there are these anti-smoke states

777
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,220
Has entered clinical phase II and phase III or has even ended

778
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:27,400
I was in our firm last year, and every year there are so-called PI speeches in our firm

779
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,920
I will talk to us about the report in the same text. The research I did is that Su’s mother has been herding sheep for 18 years.

780
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,820
Why shepherd sheep for 18 years, I will report to all of you later

781
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,200
Like this drug is 1998 in Joc this drug, this drug is this drug

782
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,500
A drug from this company

783
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,840
it uses an anti-smoke form as a drug

784
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,680
Since it published this magazine in 1998

785
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,200
everyone can see

786
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,020
until October 25, 2016

787
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,560
US APPDA

788
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,860
It actually failed the clinical phase III test, because the US APPDA felt that its

789
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,560
The results of its measurements are not hot for the present

790
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,260
Existing drugs for trauma have better outcomes

791
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,260
more meaningful difference

792
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:15,460
So the DA in the United States rejected the drug body

793
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,700
I told our comrades

794
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,200
It has been herding for 19 years

795
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,560
I may have to keep me like this for more than 20 years

796
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Because foreign funds may be more abundant

797
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,060
We are in Taiwan and I have been looking for a pharmaceutical factory to cooperate with

798
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,560
Come and help us herd the sheep

799
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,760
Then this chance of shepherding still hopes to have a chance in the future

800
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,860
You can treat the whole world based on Taiwan

801
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,760
I've been lecturing to Pops, the student council assistant in our lab,

802
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,260
We are in Xiaosuo Taiwan

803
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,260
we want something like

804
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,260
When everyone talks about similarities, they talk about old similarities

805
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,260
speaking of chocolate

806
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,360
in such a small country

807
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
How can it develop such a famous thing

808
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,560
So we're doing research in the little territorial waters

809
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,560
We want to be able to make a world that can

810
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,600
a thing used

811
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,560
let me tell you now

812
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,680
antibacterial tire

813
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,960
what does it look like

814
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,160
can let

815
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,520
Does not develop resistance like antibiotics

816
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,280
This is a very important feature

817
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,000
no antibiotics

818
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,080
antibacterial tire

819
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,480
it will have so-called

820
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,000
that

821
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,240
A break in the groove

822
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,800
A Mechanism for Breaking Bacterial Cell Membranes

823
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,960
For example it has what's called a vat side panel pattern

824
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,000
This is antibacterial tire

825
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,400
It is antibacterial on the surface of bacterial cell B or cell membrane

826
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,200
It will utilize a schema like this big bucket

827
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,760
Then insert it into the bacterial cell B or above the cell membrane

828
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,720
become a hole

829
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,320
Then the contents of the bacteria will flow out

830
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,720
Then the bacteria die

831
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,280
The other is the carpet pattern

832
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,320
I can only talk about these two very simple modes today

833
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,240
Then these two modes will let the bacteria hang

834
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,080
It's going to be a lot of fun on the web

835
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,920
very interesting video

836
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,680
I'll let everyone take a look

837
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,600
because

838
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
this

839
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,920
This is the one on YouTube

840
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,680
an interesting Data

841
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
You can see it's bacteria

842
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Then it starts to be antibacterial on the connection

843
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It will break the chain, break the determination, break some troubles

844
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
burst the bacteria

845
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You can see this green thing forming a hole

846
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Then the bacteria stuff comes out

847
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Then the bacteria disintegrates

848
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
these disintegrating things

849
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Bacteria will no longer increase in value

850
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
no more harm to the human body

851
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
So after we finish talking about this

852
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Everyone must be curious and ask me

853
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Teacher Chen, just now I was wondering if you are doing well

854
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Let's look at the next

855
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
This is the hospital cooperation published by PNS in 2014

856
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You can see it when doing PM

857
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
electron microscope

858
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You can see this is a beautiful bacillus

859
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Bacillus it passes through an antibacterial tire

860
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It's called C3A, use 0.3 micron

861
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
It can burst the bacteria

862
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,600
This is what a Streptococcus pneumoniae does in our lab

863
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,000
You can see that pneumococcus is beautiful

864
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,500
like a basketball

865
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,000
We also see these bacteria

866
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,500
I really think the recruiter is really good at recruiting

867
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,300
This is handsome eyebrow feather

868
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,000
The handsome eyebrows in this bacteria

869
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But many doctors in infection department saw this

870
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,500
Everyone is scared to death

871
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:25,000
How could so much of this thing be detected in the patient's blood

872
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,300
After we added the antibacterial status of the grouper

873
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,500
You can see the bacteria disintegrate all over it

874
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,500
This is the result of an experiment we did in 2005

875
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a troublesome disease

876
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,500
another one

877
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,500
This is the so-called vaginal petting

878
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:45,500
This is a gene bank bought vagina low pet bought by ATCC

879
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,000
This is a low favor of the vagina obtained from the clinic

880
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Vaginal low pampering can cause many unpleasant ailments for the wealthy

881
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
If we put antibacterial status together with these vagina pets

882
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You can see that this treatment of the grouper just talked to it

883
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,240
1 in 10 is disease-resistant

884
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,440
We fight disease by using ecosynthesis

885
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,600
The anti-pathological effect of a synthesized section of twenty-one amino acid

886
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,080
instead of putting the whole fish down

887
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,200
Don't get me wrong

888
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,200
After we put this synthetic anti-morbidity in

889
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,360
You can see nine hundred and sixty minutes later

890
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,960
The whole bacteria is disintegrated

891
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,280
This is the anti-morbidity obtained from the shrimp

892
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,080
It also has the same function

893
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,400
Why Vaginal Lows Are Trouble Doing

894
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,680
because it has a tick on the side

895
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,000
It hooks the cell surface of the vaginal epithelium

896
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:35,560
So the disease will be cleaned repeatedly

897
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,000
Also because of its low vaginal weight, it has so-called drug resistance

898
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,800
Many diseases are like flu

899
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,760
ate it now the drug is a so-called

900
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,240
Metadolol Anti-Correction into Coatings

901
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,000
After treatment it will become a negative recurrence

902
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,240
well , we can know anti - pathological

903
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,600
it kills these germs or something

904
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,000
This is what I just reported to you

905
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
anti-pathological it has the ability to inhibit some

906
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
suppression of immune inflammation

907
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,600
an effect of a factor

908
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,200
Let's take a look

909
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,040
It TLR method is a

910
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,400
It is a factor of inflammation immunity

911
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,040
When the car reaches this factor in the body

912
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,760
When this cell technology is manifested in large quantities

913
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,480
It's kind of like an inflammation in the body.

914
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,800
That's when I just said

915
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,120
steroids or other drugs

916
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,560
it can suppress this

917
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,520
The same antibacterial state can also inhibit it

918
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,000
what's the other interesting thing

919
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,320
Antibacterial state it can act like an antibiotic

920
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,560
Many antibiotics go into bacteria

921
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,960
It inhibits DNA to RNA

922
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,600
or RNA into the process of protein synthesis

923
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,560
The same antibacterial state will

924
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,200
In 2011 this magazine told us that

925
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,360
Antibacterial states There are many different antibacterial states

926
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,560
For example, let me take one

927
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,840
Here's an antibacterial state from that flounder

928
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,560
This antibacterial state it can inhibit DNA to protein

929
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,800
Bacterial DNA to protein synthesis

930
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,720
So now there are some studies from here

931
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,120
Reporting Research in the Lab

932
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,440
Tell us that the antimicrobial state has the potential to develop resistance

933
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,840
Currently there are some reports telling us

934
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,000
But it's all so-called artificially made in the laboratory.

935
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,200
The so-called drug resistance has not been obtained in nature

936
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,400
antimicrobial resistance of a bacterium

937
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,440
Then I will report another phenomenon to you next.

938
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,000
Just now everyone will see what I just said

939
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,440
Bacterial infection will eventually cause what systemic

940
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,200
syndrome of inflammatory response

941
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,800
so-called sepsis

942
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,600
Then many times the virus you are in the hospital

943
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,400
You will all know the so-called sepsis

944
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,400
The source of many of his infections is mostly bacteria.

945
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,200
It may also be caused by fungal viruses or gauges to produce mild in vivo

946
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,600
causing sepsis

947
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,200
That sepsis is very troublesome, that is to say

948
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,600
The trouble now is to say

949
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,000
When he screened out some kind of resistant bacteria

950
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,800
When there were no antibiotics to treat

951
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
This is the most troublesome place

952
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,200
He would treat patients with different antibiotics over and over again.

953
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,400
Of course there's no way it's going to cause what's called lung congestion.

954
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,900
then cause death

955
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,800
What about the anti... this sepsis?

956
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,400
What about sepsis?

957
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,700
Approximately 30% mortality

958
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,000
Then the mortality rate of severe sepsis is about 50%.

959
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,300
Of course it varies with age.

960
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,500
Sepsis Caused by Different Ethnic Groups and Different Regions

961
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,800
while the death rate varies

962
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,500
we must tell you now

963
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
This... is the current treatment in medicine

964
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,700
that's what i just told you

965
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,300
anticancer drugs

966
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,800
What about the anticancer drug?

967
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,100
also... it inhibits the growth of bacteria

968
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,200
that would also use some so-called intellectual healing

969
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,400
For example, steroid suppression...

970
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,900
Steroids suppress immunity

971
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,000
then will...

972
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,300
But what about the steroids?

973
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,200
It enhances the growth of bacteria

974
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,100
So when the two drugs alternate

975
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,600
It is currently a treatment for sepsis...

976
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,500
a very important step

977
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,500
I will introduce our protagonist today

978
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,900
The main character is called...

979
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
There was just a talk called Ibsidium 1

980
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,740
What about this anti-electric titanium?

981
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,240
I got it from Spotted Grouper back then

982
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,240
Everyone must not know how to call it a little grouper

983
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
It's all grouper anyway.

984
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
Because hairtail is now divided into

985
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,240
Grouper is now divided into dragon belly grouper

986
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,240
What about dragon and tiger spots?

987
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,240
I actually can't figure it out myself

988
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,240
Got a lot of different groupers

989
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,240
Anyway, the tastiest one is the dragon and tiger stripes.

990
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,240
This should be

991
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,240
Then in the process of eating fish

992
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,240
Everyone will think of something

993
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,240
You've killed fish, haven't you?

994
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,240
there may be some people who haven't killed fish

995
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,240
That fish will be slippery, right?

996
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
you know fish can be slippery

997
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,240
Then you know that in that year's luck

998
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,240
Is there antistatic titanium?

999
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,240
may not know

1000
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,240
I told you in the grouper

1001
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
Some Lucky Years contain anti-electric titanium

1002
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,240
very interesting

1003
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,240
why are you so funny

1004
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,240
You think about our life I am in this air

1005
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,240
The one in Beijing is PM2.5, right?

1006
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,240
There is no news recently

1007
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,240
There is so-called anti-glory news in Beijing's shopping

1008
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,700
Bury it there?

1009
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,120
then think about it

1010
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,640
When we were kids we were fishing

1011
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,540
when catching fish

1012
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,200
People say that if the water is clear, there will be no fish

1013
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,360
The water needs to be nourished by Pia

1014
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,220
There are many things in naked

1015
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,200
a lot of sand

1016
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,340
a lot of bacteria

1017
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,840
so the water is naked

1018
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,940
when naked

1019
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,320
Think about why you can grow up in such a naked environment

1020
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,320
How good it is to grow fat and fat

1021
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,440
That means its body is in the process of evolution

1022
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,880
Is there a special mechanism evolved?

1023
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,540
What is the mechanism of sterilization?

1024
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,040
ok

1025
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,720
So I'm here to report

1026
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,040
The stone pound fish has an antibacterial

1027
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,480
It's called IPSYN1

1028
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,240
Then this probably

1029
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,800
We are currently in the laboratory

1030
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,720
what we do antibacterial

1031
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,480
It's about 21 MG acid

1032
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,760
Then it is the so-called sheep nose with double skin

1033
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,800
It is the difference between the so-called clear water and crisp water

1034
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,040
an ecology

1035
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,640
Then we are at IPSYN1

1036
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,520
in our laboratory

1037
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,200
We have fought against swelling in the sentinel cabin

1038
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,240
Some netizens watched biological disease resistance

1039
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,960
I'm still immune and we're done.

1040
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,200
Then this is just a cute stone pound fish

1041
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
There are also a lot of stone pound fish industries in Taichung

1042
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,400
The other one is turtle fish, I want to report to you today

1043
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,900
This is the Pasidium IV of the turtle fish

1044
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:10,400
Then it comes from the so-called butter and turtle fish

1045
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,400
Then we synthesize 25 amino acids in the laboratory

1046
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,400
What about the 25 amino acids, we have already done it in the laboratory

1047
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,400
It is already known that it has antibacterial and anti-swelling effects

1048
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
I will report to you next time

1049
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,900
The antibacterial ecology of Epsidium IV How do we do its biological activity

1050
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,900
An interesting one, here I probably consist of these few

1051
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,900
Report the results of several experiments

1052
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,900
One is the infection of Helicobacter pylori infection, and the other is the infection of MSA

1053
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,900
Then let's look at the infection of Helicobacter pylori infection first

1054
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,900
Everyone must, more or less I think

1055
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,900
About 70% to 80% of the population in mainland China has Helicobacter pylori infection

1056
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,900
In Taiwan, I believe that there should be more than 40 to 50% of people who have had it

1057
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,900
Have had an infection without Helicobacter pylori infection in a lifetime

1058
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,900
Then this is a beautiful bacterium again, every time I see this bacterium I get excited

1059
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,900
do you think it looks beautiful

1060
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,280
beautiful isn't it

1061
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,960
This bacterium has a lot of braided hairs that look like aliens

1062
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,840
can grasp the gastric mucosa

1063
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,440
For a kid, a high school student should feel bad after seeing this

1064
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,200
But after you watch Alien

1065
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,880
I remember the first time in my life I watched a movie about a bunch of aliens called Liquid Ladder

1066
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,440
I don't know if you've ever seen a liquid ladder

1067
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,640
have a thumb sticking out

1068
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,440
you know like its a thumb

1069
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,960
Okay, gastric Helicobacter pylori

1070
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,240
It is indeed a negative bacteria

1071
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,600
a bacterium of its tiny oxygen

1072
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,880
The troublesome problem is gastric Helicobacter pylori

1073
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,040
if you don't narrow it down

1074
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,280
It may cause ulcers and stomach cancer in the future

1075
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,760
That's probably more than 80% of the generation

1076
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,160
will not reveal any patients

1077
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,640
that you will not hurt

1078
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,920
I won't feel my heart

1079
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,920
I won't feel like hitting anything

1080
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,600
neither will be fun

1081
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,800
Then it has about 4 to 6 braids

1082
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,680
who discovered Helicobacter eubacterium

1083
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,960
Get someone if you can talk

1084
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,000
it was obtained by two scientists

1085
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,120
2005

1086
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,200
This one is very simple to tell you

1087
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,240
just if you got

1088
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,000
Because of our Helicobacter infection

1089
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,200
what will happen

1090
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,640
One is to sell into Wei Yan

1091
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,840
The other one is to sell the shrunken Wei Yan

1092
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,440
Then his writing has been deformed.

1093
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,240
Another duodenal ulcer

1094
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,040
In the end, the most troublesome thing is cancer

1095
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,840
Cancer is really troublesome

1096
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,280
So what is currently the only cure for graceful idol infection?

1097
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,560
called antibiotics

1098
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,840
Everyone went to the hospital to finish the Wei Jing

1099
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,600
The doctor said

1100
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,440
Excuse me

1101
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,880
sir, miss

1102
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,720
you got a graceful infection

1103
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,200
The doctor will prescribe medicine for you

1104
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,200
prescribe antibiotics

1105
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,040
only antibiotics

1106
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,560
What other treatment? No

1107
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,480
You just said you could have an important medical treatment?

1108
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,440
he said no

1109
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,000
You just need to eat once

1110
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,720
Very cheap

1111
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,880
need really cheap now

1112
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,360
because I did it myself twice

1113
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,160
Treatment of Weiyan striae infection

1114
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,040
my friend also found

1115
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,320
They actually put a lot of different antibiotics

1116
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,880
to do different treatments

1117
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,240
now this is in

1118
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,400
A very similar one was published in 2011

1119
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,560
Some of the currently used medical

1120
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,360
The three-in-one model of antibiotic treatment

1121
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,960
But I'm breaking out with you that one of the antibiotics

1122
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,040
This antibiotic is interesting

1123
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,960
belly is nauseous bad fire

1124
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,600
stomach ache

1125
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,600
Bump

1126
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
have vomiting and diarrhea

1127
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It then affects some liver functions

1128
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
or disabled patients

1129
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Causes excessive moisture growth of non-susceptible molds

1130
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Then because of the superior blind spiral sense

1131
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Because drug resistance develops in a small number of patients

1132
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
still develop resistance

1133
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Everyone remember to go back first

1134
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
If you think of what you are studying in Xinjiang today

1135
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
must remember drug resistance

1136
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
bacterial resistance

1137
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
it's a very important noun

1138
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Another one is to say

1139
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
a lot of these drugs

1140
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
If it is taken with other actually anti-drugs

1141
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Troublesome things that can cause some systemic metabolism

1142
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
So it is in patients allergic to these anti-drugs

1143
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
it is unusable

1144
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But I remember the doctor didn't seem to ask me so much

1145
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
He just prescribed the medicine

1146
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
So we pass

1147
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
We will report to you first

1148
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
The antidote for vomiting and diarrhea just now

1149
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
We use electronic small cloud mirror

1150
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Just now there is a video to report to all of you

1151
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
That is to say it will really

1152
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Impressed by our Luo Sheng bacteria

1153
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Slowly it will bubble after touching

1154
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
The contents will flow out

1155
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,600
so you can see it's targeting

1156
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,440
resembling a micro throw shape

1157
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,280
To do the mechanism of impressing

1158
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,720
this is a cartoon

1159
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,560
TP4 it produces a pattern

1160
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,000
It is similar to a carpet pattern

1161
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,080
covered in bacteria

1162
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,840
needs to be used on the cell membrane

1163
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,160
then it goes inside

1164
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,280
resembling a microprojectile

1165
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,200
go in and impress it later

1166
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,480
let the contents flow out

1167
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,080
And cause the death of Youneng Helix

1168
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,080
At the same time, on the antigenic state of the grouper

1169
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,320
We also did a similar experiment

1170
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,520
You can see that in this

1171
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,480
Electronic villain inspection map

1172
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,920
You can see it's all broken too

1173
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,840
these bacteria are interesting

1174
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,640
processed by these antigenic states

1175
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,640
Bacteria completely disintegrated

1176
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,760
Do you think of an interesting story

1177
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,200
These bacteria disintegrate

1178
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,360
what will it become

1179
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,320
If you have learned

1180
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,400
If you have a little impression

1181
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,480
that is you will

1182
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,520
Do Chinese medicine practitioners say what to eat to make up for you?

1183
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,480
right

1184
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,680
you know these broken things

1185
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,000
actually a good

1186
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,100
That is to say, it can cause the body's immune response to become an antibody

1187
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,100
But antibodies can be synthesized in the future

1188
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,100
Re-cleaning a new antigen

1189
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,600
So in the process of making a vaccine in the antigenic state

1190
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,600
Emerging in the process of making a vaccine

1191
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,600
We use this model

1192
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,100
Go do some research on deep water life

1193
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,100
And got a pretty good research result

1194
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,100
Then you can see that EPI is in

1195
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:28,600
Its mode is not the same as the mode since TP4 Wuguo just now

1196
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,600
You can see that it's a

1197
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,600
A bubble is a shape of a saddle created like this

1198
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,600
Then it popped like a balloon

1199
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,000
Then break the cell coin or cell bone of this bacteria

1200
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,200
then it broke

1201
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,200
Of course everyone just saw the so-called

1202
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,200
Experiments in the chamber

1203
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,200
It's what we call an intraventricular experiment.

1204
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,700
Invisal's experiment

1205
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,700
Everyone will ask me

1206
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,700
Mr. Chen, you are really good at bragging

1207
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,700
So what's going on inside the animal body?

1208
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,700
So let's try feeding the mice

1209
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,700
because everyone likes me mouse

1210
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,700
Why

1211
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,700
Rats are all rats from heaven

1212
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,600
So when you grow up, you have to do mouse experiments

1213
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,700
let's see then

1214
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,700
We just started buying a bunch of rats that came in

1215
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,800
Of course these rats are not what everyone imagines outside

1216
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,700
caught those mice

1217
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,500
I remember when we were kids we were near the sugar cane fields

1218
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,200
Sugarcane field full of voles

1219
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,500
When you grab it, it's narrow enough to make soup with vegetables

1220
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,400
But these mice are not this kind of mice

1221
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,800
It's an SPF mouse, a very expensive one.

1222
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,400
This one of its white mice is white and fat

1223
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,200
Challenges that allow you to do different bacteria

1224
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,200
then let you know say

1225
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,600
Did this experimental rat succeed?

1226
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,000
Of course animal rights groups may seriously protest that

1227
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,800
This white mouse can actually be a stupid mouse

1228
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,100
But these white mice

1229
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,600
On the development of our biomedicine

1230
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,500
They really are our heroes

1231
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,300
unsung post-pregnancy animal heroes

1232
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,700
What are we doing with these unsung animal heroes now

1233
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,200
Just let it acclimate to the environment for a while

1234
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,800
Then do two infections

1235
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,500
Just let it have in the stomach

1236
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,800
Because of the growth of pylorospira infection

1237
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,700
After growing we can put the mouse

1238
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,200
After a week of growth

1239
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,020
In time, we slaughtered the mice in the mouse part

1240
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,000
then feed it inside

1241
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,200
Take a look to see if there is any generation of Yumen Luoxuan in it

1242
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,220
because if not

1243
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,160
We mean we can't drug it

1244
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,800
Then we took what you all saw just now

1245
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,700
Shipan Fish Soup is the soup above the turtle

1246
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,800
The Anti-Yantai We Got

1247
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,560
like you eat cold syrup

1248
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,400
Didi

1249
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,660
it didn't drip

1250
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,000
I don't know what rats taste like

1251
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,260
Then I think it's Didi

1252
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,500
Didi poured it into the rat's feed

1253
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,300
let it eat

1254
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,100
So the rats ate for 14 days

1255
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,100
We'll kill the rats again in two weeks

1256
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,460
then watch it feed inside

1257
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:37,000
Is there any production of Youmen Luoxuan?

1258
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,300
We did a total of three different experiments

1259
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,000
An anti-yantai called rockfish

1260
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,400
An anti-yantai called turtle fish

1261
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,660
One is currently used clinically

1262
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,060
Three-in-one Anti-Agarin

1263
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,400
But we didn't make one here

1264
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,900
Experiments with self-acids

1265
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,160
because we thought of saying

1266
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,160
Will there be no need to use self-acid in the future?

1267
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,460
you can pour the medicine in

1268
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,860
So the experiment we poured in

1269
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,120
You can see this red mark error

1270
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,120
on the turtle fish

1271
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,640
Anti-smoke titanium obtained above

1272
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,400
You can see after we kill the rats

1273
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,280
Where are these mice?

1274
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,800
1、2、3、4、5、6

1275
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,600
6 mice we got

1276
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,360
It turns out there's really nothing in it

1277
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,200
Production of gastric pyloric helix infection

1278
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,800
We get really low levels of fine smoke from the stomach

1279
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,200
But without any medication

1280
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,240
its fine smoke is really high

1281
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,600
You can see this 6

1282
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,480
Digital Moon High Represents

1283
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,240
Rats with higher levels of fine smoke

1284
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,520
Digital month low represents

1285
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,880
The amount of fine smoke in the mouse body is less

1286
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,720
But you can see the three-in-one drug

1287
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,920
You can see its gastric pyloric helix infection

1288
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,520
still very high

1289
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,400
Probably between 4, 4 and 5

1290
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,360
but we can see here

1291
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,840
Probably below 1

1292
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,160
The benefits of eating more black mushroom fish

1293
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,160
Then this black mushroom fish is in the ecology we synthesized

1294
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,280
you can see we are

1295
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,480
This little bit of red is like thin smoke

1296
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,080
You can see that we use

1297
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,800
a particular coloring pattern

1298
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,640
can see it these

1299
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,240
what about these

1300
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,640
This time with a three-in-one

1301
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,320
Mice treated with anti-smoke

1302
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,760
It still produces fine smoke

1303
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,520
But we use the anti-smoke of black mushroom fish to get in too much

1304
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,400
Because there is basically no bacteria produced when it is ground inside.

1305
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,600
Those people didn't use any treatment first.

1306
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,000
It turns out that it has a lot of bacteria producing

1307
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
You see that click-throughs represent bacteria

1308
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Those are bacteria

1309
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,200
What about these groupers

1310
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,300
An antigen embryo obtained by clicking on a grouper

1311
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,700
You can also see the same result

1312
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,000
This red is also marked

1313
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,400
That is to say, the antigen embryo obtained from the grouper

1314
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,900
It is also possible to put rats in the stomach

1315
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,400
The stomach feeling is very low

1316
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,000
So this gives us a new hope

1317
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,800
I just had a Psychedelic

1318
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,400
Tell everyone about the emerging drugs in the future of mankind

1319
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,400
Could it be obtained from water porridge?

1320
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,700
That's the very special PCR principle we use

1321
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:42,100
There is also the Western target point analysis method of the protein pattern

1322
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,400
Verify that there is still a mouse in the body

1323
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,900
yes and those bacteria

1324
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,300
Then we can all find out that

1325
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,700
If there is no treatment, there are antigens to eat

1326
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,300
Basically you can see that there are no class fragments here

1327
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,900
without any white fragments

1328
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,700
It means that there is no such bacteria produced

1329
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,200
Ok so we get an interesting result

1330
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,000
that is

1331
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,060
This mouse is very cute. The mouse ate Youmenyou's sour bacteria

1332
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,620
It really has Acidophilus bacteria in it

1333
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,960
very similar to human infection

1334
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,260
Humans are also passed through food, kissing, and infection

1335
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,760
We also let it eat our disease-resistant fetus later

1336
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,940
Through these experiments, we all found that it really chewed off

1337
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,140
This is our conclusion that

1338
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,560
I have not mentioned some regulatory factors of immunity here

1339
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,940
because that is cumbersome

1340
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,100
So I can only talk about the results of animal experiments

1341
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,100
Then what is my second little experiment to report to you?

1342
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,960
Everyone will be tired, right?

1343
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,300
there may be some people who are not tired

1344
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:39,040
But when I was in college I was tired and miserable

1345
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,920
Tired and painful Tired and miserable

1346
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,200
just fell off a motorcycle

1347
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,200
You can see that car slowly coming

1348
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,500
People slowly rubbed against the ground

1349
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,860
Then you wonder why my parking space can't be blocked

1350
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,460
Why does it keep coming to the opposite parking space?

1351
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:57,460
And when you get up you see a little gash on your leg

1352
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,960
You touch that gun and it won't hurt

1353
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,800
Really I think the wheel is really very very

1354
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,080
You won't find out until you wake up and find it broken

1355
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,400
Why is your leg hurting and bleeding

1356
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,200
Alright, everyone, did you think you would stay

1357
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,200
Have you looked closely at your wounds?

1358
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,400
The wound will flow out in the process of bathing in the river

1359
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,200
yellow sticky sticky

1360
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,800
Sometimes it smells so bad

1361
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,400
right

1362
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,800
Have you ever touched and smelled it yourself?

1363
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,000
you know what that is

1364
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,200
that very very very interesting person

1365
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,800
I may really have nothing to do since I was in college.

1366
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,800
internal trouble

1367
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,600
it's itchy

1368
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,800
Itches and you want to pull out the wound

1369
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,200
In the process of pulling it up, it will start to bathe in the wound

1370
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,200
I just look at my wounds every day

1371
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,000
start to bathe in the river

1372
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,800
Then there is a little white yellow juice flowing out

1373
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,800
And then it smells really good

1374
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,800
I later found out that it was bacteria

1375
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,800
immune cells in your body

1376
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,400
Giant Cell Moderate HP

1377
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,000
The structure under the suspicion of contact with bacteria

1378
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
stinks is some of it

1379
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
that product

1380
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,960
Alright, let's talk to you now

1381
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,200
Everyone must remember

1382
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,000
These two things happened in 2014 and 2015

1383
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
How many people died, how many people were injured

1384
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,200
We won't be a rich prize here

1385
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,200
but it's a hassle

1386
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,400
so traumatized

1387
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,800
Everyone should see

1388
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,200
Mr. Chen, you always ride a motorcycle

1389
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,440
a wound like a big one

1390
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,500
You're still here to tell us all

1391
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,500
Tell us about science salary

1392
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,500
Then why do these people just hang up?

1393
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,500
wait a minute and you'll see

1394
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,500
little trauma

1395
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,500
mainly cause them

1396
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,500
they get bacterial infections

1397
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,500
At the same time, I also got what I just reported to you

1398
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,500
sepsis after bacterial infection

1399
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,500
So we experimentally

1400
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,500
we just want us to hurt

1401
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,500
Because I just reported to you

1402
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,500
Although I studied marine biology in college

1403
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,000
But when I was in college, I used to take pictures of horse races

1404
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,500
Then the photos of the horse race often leave the disabled

1405
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Trauma

1406
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,500
so i just keep watching my legs

1407
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,500
I can think about it later

1408
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,700
One day in the middle of the lab I found out that the mouse is a great friend again

1409
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,380
another unsung hero

1410
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,900
Well the unsung hero we bought these mice again

1411
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:13,540
Then we created a 1 cm by 1 cm wound on him

1412
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,580
So what do we deal with this trauma? Deal with the antibacterial state

1413
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,080
This is what we use Staphylococcus aureus

1414
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,920
Oxygen Resistant

1415
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,880
Staphylococcus aureus

1416
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,960
This bacterial infection is currently in the hospital

1417
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,160
Still a bacterial infection with a really bad headache

1418
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,500
is a lot of time

1419
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,460
Then let's take this mouse

1420
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:35,800
Doesn't it have iron plates with a size of 1 cm and 1 cm square on its back?

1421
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,400
The mouse will come out with a slight trauma

1422
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,080
Then we take the amount of bacteria to the 6th power of 10

1423
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,120
10 to the power of 6 the amount of bacteria each mouse drops on it

1424
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,080
This bacteria will grow on the back of its mouse

1425
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,720
then becomes an infected open wound

1426
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,860
As you can see this has been the result of what I think we did for 14 days

1427
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,360
Report to everyone that this is the plugging group

1428
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,020
It's the control group, it's the mouse

1429
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Did not put any bacteria, and did not put any treatment

1430
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
it will add up by itself, it will start

1431
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Because it uses its own body immunity to do wound healing

1432
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
But there is MRSA, have you seen the yellow over here

1433
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
we're the ones who stink and have fun

1434
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
This is the result of bacterial infection

1435
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
It's about ninety-six hours after the fourth day

1436
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
The mouse is dead

1437
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
But if because it's MRSA bacteria

1438
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It allows the so-called venomission

1439
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
All things, enzymes, antibiotics for treatment

1440
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
because it's going to kill this, i just said

1441
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
There are some antibiotics that kill certain bacteria

1442
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Some bacteria can be killed by certain antibiotics

1443
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
You can see that the skin is still very well restored

1444
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
very beautiful

1445
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
But if this MRSA bacteria

1446
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Because the M is the antibiotic

1447
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
This MRSA bacteria, because resistant to this antibiotic

1448
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
So even if you go on this antibiotic

1449
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
The mouse is over

1450
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,200
Simple and easy to report to everyone

1451
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,200
Maybe watch me here for a second

1452
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,100
This mouse is dead

1453
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,600
but think about it

1454
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,000
on top of humans

1455
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,600
If you experience a bacterial infection with this antibiotic

1456
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,300
It will hang up in 96 hours soon

1457
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,700
so you think about it

1458
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,500
We are looking for a new

1459
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,000
Drugs that can replace antibiotics

1460
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,800
ok let's see next

1461
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,400
EPI is what I just told you

1462
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,800
Antibacterial status obtained by pointing on the rice

1463
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,600
The probability of 33 is that I just reported to you

1464
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,700
That one nose got antibacterial status

1465
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,100
Add collagen this time

1466
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,300
Because everyone is emphasizing beauty now

1467
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,600
When many wounds heal

1468
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,800
no scars

1469
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,300
or if you are on medication

1470
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,600
I also want collagen

1471
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,400
Can promote wound healing

1472
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,500
we can see that is to say

1473
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,900
Meals also come to an antibacterial state

1474
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,900
how well its wounds heal

1475
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,800
very beautiful by the tenth day

1476
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,000
All the hair has grown back

1477
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,500
if you add collagen

1478
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,600
Its fur grows more beautifully and faster

1479
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,100
So we believe in collagen

1480
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
We see him mixed in with the anti-morbid process

1481
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,700
Just now as a raw drug

1482
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,960
Quality of Raw Drugs

1483
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,000
Then he went forward and came out

1484
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,240
so he can see him

1485
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,700
When the third day started here

1486
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,000
and a little yellow

1487
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
But in the end he did really well

1488
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,500
Let's look at the angiogenesis treated by these drugs

1489
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,360
Why do you want to explode angiogenesis with everyone?

1490
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,960
you may not know

1491
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,060
there are some models

1492
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,160
or some ambiguous people

1493
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,460
It's not just a trio of jades

1494
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:29,360
Some people because he wants to wear

1495
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,820
wear some swimwear

1496
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,160
or some people

1497
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,520
he has three mouths in the face

1498
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,760
He hoped that his three jades would be on Mino Medicine

1499
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,260
I hope he will have a lot of angiogenesis

1500
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,560
Because this will cause a scar to come out

1501
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,320
so you can see

1502
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,960
We are in the whole process of angiogenesis

1503
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,920
If you have added anti-morbid process

1504
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,720
You can all see it like this anti-morbid

1505
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,120
or this flounder's disease-resistant

1506
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,920
You can see that his angiogenesis is beautiful

1507
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,860
If comparing a control group

1508
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,420
Or for groups with ice or microphones

1509
00:57:59,420 --> 00:57:59,980
he finally

1510
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Those new students are very beautiful

1511
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
then it has another

1512
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
The other is called can promote

1513
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Stimulus for production technology

1514
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
We are still doing related research

1515
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Then we can report to you

1516
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
This is the main part of MRSA

1517
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I just told you

1518
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Is the ancestor dead?

1519
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
But scientific research cannot say that he is dead

1520
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Scientific research must ask why

1521
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Has the number of bacteria in the ancestors been suppressed?

1522
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
If it's not pressed down you can see it's funny

1523
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Sometimes we go home when the drug is actually administered

1524
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
medicine prescribed by your doctor

1525
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Everyone take one medicine and you don't take it if you feel better

1526
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Doctors sometimes prescribe a three- or seven-day regimen

1527
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
there is a reason for it

1528
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
For example, when your bacterial count is suppressed

1529
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
you feel like a doctor

1530
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
No more antibiotics or medicine

1531
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Then your bacteria count went up again

1532
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Then what will happen after this goes up?

1533
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
secondary infection

1534
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
then it was more troublesome

1535
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
So you can see that is

1536
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
We use Jialin Xilin as just mentioned

1537
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
More troublesome, he has many side effects

1538
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
but now

1539
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,860
If this anti-pseudobacteria

1540
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,600
in mice

1541
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,720
It's about the fourth day it's all dead

1542
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,920
So the bacteria here just can't see any bacteria

1543
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,680
We can't see the fungus that we drew blood from the mice

1544
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,880
But if you use the TP3 from the turtle and hedgehog

1545
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,120
Or the EBI from the grouper hedgehog

1546
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,080
You can see it on day 17

1547
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,120
Its bacterial count is almost zero

1548
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,320
It means that it no longer has this kind of bacteria in its body

1549
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,160
These bacteria were killed by our anti-pregnancy

1550
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,280
So anti-pregnancy may be a

1551
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,720
the future may be a

1552
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,040
Medicines for burns and skin infections

1553
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,200
Everyone will definitely say that Mr. Chen knew that he was a mouse

1554
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,200
How do I know the rats are fun for everyone

1555
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,760
Every time you make a mouse, you will have a lot of

1556
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,320
Experimental results that seem to have potential

1557
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,080
So we're going to be pigs

1558
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,080
Then why else?

1559
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,400
Because of the pig I think I have a real bond with it

1560
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,320
If this pig succeeds

1561
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:57,080
It will also be similar to medium and large animals.

1562
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,440
Then what's the king next?

1563
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,700
We hope to be able to enter the so-called clinical testing

1564
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:09,300
For example, using monkeys or using pre-clinical tests to find some CRL companies

1565
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,700
It is the clinical testing company that helps us do these tests

1566
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,900
You can see that it is the same in the experimental process of strains

1567
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,700
We use the anti-morbidity from the grouper

1568
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:20,900
We use 1000 times or 100 times or 10 times the number of MIC

1569
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:26,100
In addition, we have a 14-party MSA that is 10 higher on the plant this time.

1570
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,500
you can see it to the end

1571
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,500
In fact, the wound area is doing very well.

1572
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:36,100
10 of 14 party MSA, you can see its bacteria and its wound sealing speed is not so fast

1573
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,300
In all this 25th day

1574
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:41,200
Look at the different bacterial infections and different treatment processes this time

1575
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,600
For example, we use 10 times the number of MIC

1576
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,500
MIC is the minimum concentration of bacteria that can kill bacteria

1577
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:51,000
You can see the amount of EPI we use 10 times the MIC

1578
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,200
You can see it grow over time

1579
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,100
it precloses the wound very well

1580
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,200
If you use 100 times the amount of MIC

1581
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,200
It wound up running away for the last 25 days

1582
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
will run faster

1583
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,600
Kamdor is like a mouse

1584
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,400
nothing goes out

1585
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,600
just heat it up

1586
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,200
If we use 1000 times the MIC

1587
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,600
this EPI

1588
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,800
then you can see

1589
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,800
it is also

1590
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,600
Also the wound is also very good

1591
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,100
but we later

1592
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,400
If it is really eaten at the waist

1593
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,400
We don't need to use 1000 times

1594
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,400
that is expensive

1595
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,500
so we can grab a

1596
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,500
good connections

1597
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,900
market we are above pigs

1598
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,800
good results on mice

1599
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,900
We also get good results on pigs

1600
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,400
make us more confident

1601
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,400
Can advance to clinical

1602
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:31,100
So we can all report

1603
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,400
Anti-Tiantai MAB can be used as

1604
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,600
I also come to fight the substitute

1605
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,000
Then Anti-Tiantai did not cause immune stimulation

1606
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,400
At least we have partial results

1607
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,000
have told us

1608
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,100
It does not cause bothersome immune stimulation

1609
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:41,800
Another one is

1610
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:45,000
We hope that the research results can be sold into clinical trials.

1611
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,700
Everyone after Lei gave birth

1612
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,900
A foreshadowing of what I just said

1613
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,200
After Lei gave birth, I said

1614
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,200
You won't be in pain during Ray's process

1615
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,600
But when it thunders you will hurt

1616
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,100
Everyone will feel pain

1617
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,000
in the burn process

1618
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,800
or when you pick your wounds

1619
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Everyone will be in pain, it is impossible that no one will not be in pain, right?

1620
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,500
Well, in the process of going through the pain, you will think of one thing

1621
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:13,000
Is there any possibility of anti-morbidity in treating the wound healing process

1622
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,500
Make wounds painless, or humans painless, or animals painless

1623
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:22,000
So I went to find a very good friend named Teacher Wen Zhirong

1624
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
He is a teacher at Zhongshan University

1625
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,500
We use an anti-pathological agent called PCDI1

1626
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,500
In 2015 we were able to know that

1627
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,500
We know from the ancestors that it is anti-morbid

1628
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,000
It actually has the effect of suppressing pain

1629
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,500
it's really fun

1630
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,500
So we hope to develop into a drug in the future

1631
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:44,000
Applying this can not only make the wound heal well

1632
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
It can kill bacteria and make the pain less painful

1633
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,500
you may not know

1634
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,500
those in the process of burn injury

1635
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,500
For example, the gas explosion in Kaohsiung just mentioned

1636
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,500
or a burn at an amusement park

1637
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,500
General burns such as general chairs

1638
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,800
In fact, there are already flower feet at home.

1639
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,920
If the whole body has 2, 30% barbecue

1640
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,500
that was excruciatingly painful

1641
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,400
So our Western family is on drug development

1642
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:12,000
In addition to our drug can have many different functions

1643
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,400
I'm going to talk about my last chop

1644
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,100
The last study result

1645
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,900
I told you about cancer when I first started

1646
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,800
3 million is not a small number

1647
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,700
Ordinary people in the process of cancer treatment

1648
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,600
For example, the process of doing PL-1

1649
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,900
Now the latest process is 3 million

1650
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,800
But is there any possibility that we can reduce the process of it

1651
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,600
lower its price

1652
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,600
Because we use a simple anti-pregnancy state for treatment

1653
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,500
This is an anti-pregnancy state we got

1654
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,800
We do some antibacterial ecology

1655
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:47,100
3491 articles were published from 1990 to 2015

1656
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,400
currently existing

1657
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,100
Our anti-pregnancy state, let us first introduce

1658
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,400
This generation is an anti-pregnancy state above the flounder

1659
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,000
Our name is Potassium

1660
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
The anti-pregnancy description is probably listed here

1661
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
It is also an anti-pregnancy state that can impress

1662
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,100
that this generation

1663
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Humans have a thing called fibrous meat flow

1664
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
So-called fibromyalgia can also be seen on dogs or cats

1665
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
All of you should, if you have ever had pets,

1666
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
The older your dog is, the more it will give birth

1667
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
messy stuff

1668
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
There are a lot of fiber meat flow

1669
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Of course, it can be removed directly by surgery.

1670
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
This can be surgically removed

1671
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
This can also be surgically removed

1672
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
But some surgical cuts can really be done with a knife

1673
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
This incident caused many surgeons to raise a question mark

1674
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I give an example

1675
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Some people here will get oral cancer

1676
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Some people will swell up a big pile on this side, a big ball

1677
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
The surgeon moved the knife when there was a big ball

1678
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
it will be tim gu ass skin flesh to fill this side

1679
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
But sometimes when the dirty mouth is too big

1680
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
It dare not move a knife

1681
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
So when we first started doing anti-cancer experiments

1682
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
We discuss the results with the surgeon

1683
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
They just want us to find a way to shrink the tumor

1684
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Then let them move the knife to do the experiment

1685
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
so we now

1686
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Later, we chose this anti-cancer

1687
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,340
We make fiber meat flow HT1080 is a fiber meat flow for human beings

1688
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:05,940
Let's fight on the snail

1689
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,940
We can see it after playing

1690
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:10,940
We're doing anti-facial injections

1691
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,140
injection on the tumor

1692
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:15,440
It really has something to do with the control group

1693
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,440
it really has some differences

1694
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,940
Difference in Tumor Size

1695
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,000
That's the Golden Collie

1696
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,240
wait a minute i'll tell you

1697
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,140
The golden collie later we were on the mouse and it was still the same

1698
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:25,440
we have a lot of time

1699
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,340
we do

1700
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,940
It's not just experiments that want to do rats

1701
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:30,340
Experiments in my lab

1702
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:33,340
We all hope that when we're done with the fish

1703
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,340
mouse that made a butterfly

1704
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,240
and then to medium and large animals

1705
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,240
How about doing it on a dog or a pig

1706
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,540
In the future, if our laboratory hypocrisy fish

1707
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:42,740
We also hope to cooperate with others

1708
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,740
Experiments that can be done on monkeys

1709
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,440
That's an experiment on dogs

1710
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,340
We can see some microsteel flow in the dog

1711
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,840
you can see a different dog this time

1712
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,840
this is husky hal

1713
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,340
Howl's dog

1714
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:57,040
that's a mixed dog

1715
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,040
just normal

1716
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,400
Then this time, let's look at this dog

1717
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,000
On the seventeenth day of the tumor on the back side of the steel gate we punched in

1718
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
A large tumor can be seen

1719
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,700
Then today we are Theorem Yuntian

1720
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,700
Then at the ten thousandth time

1721
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,900
We can see that the tumor is starting to fade a bit

1722
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,900
During those nineteen days and twenty-six days

1723
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:19,300
Its tumors have actually been affected by our drugs.

1724
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,000
disintegrated its tumor

1725
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,800
On the thirty-seventh day, thirty-three day, thirty-seventh day

1726
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,700
We can see that the tumor is completely gone

1727
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,000
In dogs at the ninety-third day after cessation of spanking

1728
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
The dog's tumors are completely gone

1729
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,400
The dog is alive and well and happy

1730
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,000
Then we changed the PET bottle to let you tell Zhizhi

1731
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,500
How big is this dog

1732
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
then we can know

1733
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,900
In dogs we have tumors

1734
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,900
then we have to ask another question

1735
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:50,600
Is it only the anti-pregnancy effect on the Bilu fish that I just ate?

1736
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,600
So we start with what we do every day

1737
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:55,900
Real thing over the above to get another anti-pregnancy

1738
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
called TP4

1739
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,500
Then the anti-pregnancy on the turtle

1740
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,000
it probably has...

1741
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,260
There are five types of antimicrobial cancer

1742
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,260
But when we were doing MIC

1743
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:04,460
we can know say

1744
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:08,260
TP4 number fourth this anti-cancer is the best

1745
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,860
Its bactericidal ability is the best

1746
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,360
Usually it has the best bactericidal ability

1747
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,760
We think it's also good against cancer

1748
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:14,660
so we can

1749
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:17,100
At the beginning, we chose trinity breast cancer

1750
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,900
Trinity breast cancer is currently in the negative category of breast cancer

1751
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,400
The tightest in treatment

1752
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,800
because it is

1753
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,660
It has these three different

1754
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:28,660
Variations in different genes

1755
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:30,920
So it's troublesome on medication

1756
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,560
Some Drugs Actually Don't Work Against Trinity Breast Cancer

1757
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,320
In terms of treatment

1758
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,920
So we're going to fight on Lord Luo

1759
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,420
Lord Luo, we can see

1760
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:40,360
This is a general KY dye cream

1761
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,720
we are on the lord

1762
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,520
Added ours with KY dye cream

1763
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,560
Antibacterial tire of black spinach puree

1764
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,320
you can see its tumor

1765
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,020
start getting small

1766
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,320
especially you can see that is to say

1767
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,220
Only with KY dyeing cream alone

1768
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:52,620
Now add tumor cells

1769
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:53,960
it's on top of whole milk

1770
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,060
it varies greatly

1771
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:57,960
but if we add we add

1772
01:07:58,060 --> 01:07:59,060
Antibacterial tires

1773
01:07:59,060 --> 01:07:59,960
Then you can see it whole

1774
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
actually shrunk

1775
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,400
Including we can use some tissue immune infection

1776
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,500
It can be seen that the IC packages in its anti-tire have been changed.

1777
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,500
are smaller

1778
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,600
There is no only KI in it.

1779
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,400
The other parts are the so-called IC package

1780
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,000
So we did it on the mouse

1781
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,200
We also use fish for verification

1782
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,900
Because in Lin Hai's research, when we talk about

1783
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:21,400
The zebrafish is a very, very simple story

1784
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,900
very easy little technique

1785
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:25,500
So our example on the fish

1786
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,800
The three slices of cells from which we

1787
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,600
Punch in from the vein of its heart

1788
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,800
it can be right here

1789
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,200
has a colored cell

1790
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,200
Go up and type in the red IC bag

1791
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,400
you can see that

1792
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,400
After the chair passed

1793
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,400
Its IC package will grow over time

1794
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,700
to circulate throughout the body of the fish

1795
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,600
But if we add TV4 later

1796
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,500
You'll be able to see the IC package that says it's

1797
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,300
actually started getting smaller

1798
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,500
was spun off by Juju or even killed.

1799
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,000
this is a short video

1800
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,400
This is the video we shot

1801
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,100
you can see that is to say

1802
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,000
what about this fish

1803
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,740
when it is not treated with any medication

1804
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:05,440
This red IC is wrapped in its body

1805
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,480
it grows over time

1806
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,840
the fish finally exploded

1807
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,060
like just saw

1808
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:12,240
IC package if not processed

1809
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,700
then it will explode

1810
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:14,980
because it's getting bigger

1811
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:16,980
But what if our fish

1812
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:21,120
We carefully put three high-roller TP4s in it

1813
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,100
Let's see how it turns out

1814
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,240
What about the IC bag?

1815
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,500
it will start shrinking

1816
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:26,840
as time increases

1817
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,840
it starts to disappear

1818
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:32,620
But this IC package passes through this fish

1819
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:35,580
Soak in water containing anti-cigarette

1820
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:40,060
Its IC package was killed by our anti-yantai

1821
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:41,620
so what do we want to do in the future

1822
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:43,600
We want to talk to a doctor in the future

1823
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,500
say these parents' breast cancer wounds

1824
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,940
You can see it learns in tacit understanding

1825
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:48,200
ribs can be seen

1826
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:52,200
We also hope to build a pet market

1827
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,840
Then let's go back to bacteria

1828
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,440
bacteria you can see that is to say

1829
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,440
resistant bacteria

1830
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,440
now we can know

1831
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:09,300
There are many, many, including the United States, including China, are very, very troubled by bacterial infections

1832
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:16,000
Especially like mainland China, I think they have recently been on the weakest magazines in recent years

1833
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:22,400
They talked about the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria on pigs in many areas

1834
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,500
so it's a headache

1835
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:29,300
In March 2015 when Obama was President Obama

1836
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,000
he has signed a bill

1837
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
What is this bill for?

1838
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
The plan of this bill is to invest a lot of money

1839
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,300
Seeking scientists from all over the world to cooperate with American scientists

1840
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:47,000
Conduct an antimicrobial resistant bacteria to find a new type of drug

1841
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
to deal with new drug-resistant bacteria

1842
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
The bill is now signed

1843
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,300
So we're probably this is what I'm just starting out with

1844
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:00,000
In March 2016, a magazine told us

1845
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,900
A report in an editorial magazine told us that

1846
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:06,360
Scientists in Spain find human-raised dog feces inside

1847
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,400
A bacterium of such a family as Eubacteriaceae

1848
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,400
So what is the existence of this bacteria?

1849
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,860
There will be a major threat to human health and benefits

1850
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,860
Everyone, don't forget what I just told you

1851
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:17,860
What happens to dog poop?

1852
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:21,560
Sometimes pets are in the process of excreting

1853
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,060
we all stay at home

1854
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:27,860
Because I have a friend who has two small, new dogs at home

1855
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:31,260
I see he's a dog if he poops

1856
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:32,760
Just take the toilet paper and insert it yourself

1857
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,760
I don't know if it was absorbed after insertion

1858
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,460
But in the process of inserting

1859
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:39,260
Think about it, if there's germs in it, it's on your hands

1860
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:41,560
When you don't want to play when you eat

1861
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,760
eat it in your stomach

1862
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,760
I just had a fantasy film to tell you about

1863
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,960
passing through the food chain or passing through excrement

1864
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:52,460
You may have these so-called drug-resistant bacteria in your body

1865
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:54,760
Then the bacteria are very troublesome, that is to say

1866
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:58,660
There are very few so-called antibiotics for muscle now to treat it

1867
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:00,660
may be more troublesome in the future

1868
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:10,000
The other one is that you may still remember the TV of the player in the history where the player in the history had a salsa

1869
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
He had a cameraman shot in India before

1870
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:19,000
After the shooting, when he was sent to China for treatment, he was found to have an MDM1 bacterium on his body

1871
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
MDM1 and MDM1 Bacterial Infection

1872
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
He said that MDM1 was scared to death and now there are probably only two types of resistance that can treat him

1873
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Therefore, the current environment where humans are more enlightened is the emergence of more and more drug-resistant bacteria

1874
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:41,000
This is our own in the laboratory, we talk to the doctors in the laboratory and colleagues in the laboratory

1875
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
We ask all of us to report

1876
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
In the whole process of reporting to you just now, we learned from aquatic organisms

1877
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Originally, we discovered fish disease problems from aquatic residue farming.

1878
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
We want to solve the fish disease and want to replace the traditional aquatic residue farming which uses resistance data

1879
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Inside the traditional aquaculture

1880
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,800
Use some chemical reagents to cure stupidity

1881
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,900
Then we found out that fish is actually a very interesting thing

1882
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:09,760
There is something like an antibacterial state in the fish that produces

1883
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,160
Of course, there is a so-called antibacterial state in the human body

1884
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:14,600
However, the experimental results we have done so far

1885
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,600
We discovered an antimicrobial state that we can't find in fish

1886
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,760
Its bactericidal ability appears to be greater than some of the antibacterial states found above in humans

1887
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,200
Also excellent, the bactericidal effect is better

1888
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,000
So we can ask for a future

1889
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,100
we already know

1890
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:30,200
We can probably know that in 2007

1891
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,200
We found this antibacterial state

1892
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,100
This antimicrobial status is found on meal fish

1893
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,500
I just reported to you

1894
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,100
Sum Ya 19 years

1895
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,100
We expect in 2027

1896
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,100
We hope to push it to the clinic

1897
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:43,500
But the process of these 20 years

1898
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,300
We may need to go through countless failures

1899
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,400
can be extended to the entire process

1900
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,500
Only then can we go to the clinical test in the so-called space

1901
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,500
This is our vision for the future

1902
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:57,900
I also hope that all the gentlemen and ladies here today

1903
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,100
In the future, expect to be in 15 years or 20 years

1904
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,380
Then we can see clinically that it is such a drug

1905
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:04,500
so i just told you

1906
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,980
There is already such a drug in 2015

1907
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:11,440
Emerging FDA has recognized an antibiotic that can be marketed

1908
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,780
A new type of antibiotic

1909
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:16,940
In the past ten or twenty years, no emerging antibiotics have emerged

1910
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:21,180
But only in the last two years has this new antibiotic been produced

1911
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:24,340
We hope this is the Sikama company

1912
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:27,580
We are currently selling all kinds of anti-hospital tires

1913
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,980
it serves as a raw material

1914
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:32,060
You can see that the Sikama company also has a number with it

1915
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:35,020
SMML0013

1916
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:36,660
This is our anti-hospital tire

1917
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:40,820
It has a lot of references listed above

1918
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:43,960
All are the result of research and development in our laboratory

1919
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:47,380
You can go to the Sikama website if you are interested

1920
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:50,720
Enter the name EBCIN

1921
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,020
EBIECIDIN

1922
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:56,080
You can see that a product like ours is in the pharmaceutical factory of Sikama

1923
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,860
There is a listing for them on sale

1924
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,560
So Meng Yang hopes that this drug can become similar to this 1.4.1 in 20 years.

1925
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:07,660
To help humans solve the problem of drug resistance

1926
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:14,060
Of course I have to thank many students in my laboratory

1927
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:16,500
For example, Dr. Ding Zong, he is my doctor

1928
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,000
There is also Dr. Huang Anning, who is a business opportunity consultant.

1929
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,540
It seems that Dr. Ding did it.

1930
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:24,240
In addition, Jay Ang is an Indian student who is doing Youmenlu group induction

1931
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,960
There is also Dr. Pan Jieyi

1932
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,440
He is now at Gaohua University of Science and Technology of China

1933
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,280
He was experimenting with tumors in dogs

1934
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,840
And Mr. Jian Jixian also assisted us in the tumor experiment of dogs.

1935
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,380
There are other teachers Xu Junsheng and Li Xianping who will be in the future respectively

1936
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:41,880
Our development of anti-drugs will play a very important role

1937
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:43,180
Of course the most important

1938
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:45,240
We are currently doing experiments with pigs

1939
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,640
It is all in cooperation with Mr. Wu Hongyi of Pingtung University of Science and Technology

1940
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,240
The pig experiment depends on him

1941
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,640
Because he has a beneficiary license

1942
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,740
Because there are many things that can help us experiment

1943
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,240
You just saw it

1944
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:59,300
In fact, at the beginning, Wu acted as an anti-court

1945
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,140
anti-animals

1946
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,500
The animal experiment teacher should be my junior

1947
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,560
He should be younger than me by two years

1948
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,640
Teacher Wu Zhangze

1949
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,660
He is Mr. Wu Zhangze from the Department of Teachers, Ocean University

1950
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,740
Back when I didn't know how to do animal experiments

1951
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:14,160
I'm totally going to ask him to help me

1952
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,700
conduct similar animal experiments

1953
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,700
Including if you see burns or

1954
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,700
Uber Luoxuan's induction experiment

1955
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,700
This is Huang Anning

1956
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:23,700
I especially want to show his photo today

1957
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:26,700
Because usually when we say thank you

1958
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:28,100
maybe only the name

1959
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,400
Everyone doesn't know what he looks like

1960
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,400
you'll see he can ask him some questions

1961
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,400
Huang Anning is excellent

1962
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,400
He got last year and the year before

1963
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,900
Received the Outstanding Postdoctoral Research Award from the Ministry of Science and Technology

1964
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,900
this is a rare award

1965
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:43,400
He seems to be out of blue and Sheng Yilan

1966
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,900
Because I have not yet received the Outstanding Research Award from the Ministry of Science and Technology

1967
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:50,400
He has already received the postdoctoral outstanding research award from the Ministry of Science and Technology

1968
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,400
The other one is Dr. Pan Jieyi

1969
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,400
He's a tumor for a dog

1970
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,400
fat like this

1971
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,400
Then our full time is the latest photoshoot

1972
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,400
Dress a little more tiresome

1973
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,240
Then this is Dr. Ding Zhenghong, this is his wife who just got married this year

1974
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:11,000
Then Dr. Ding Zhenghong is doing the experiment of three-one into five cancers, and recently he is doing the experiment of lung cancer

1975
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,400
Then we recently thought of an excellent model experiment for the treatment of lung cancer

1976
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:21,800
I hope that in 15 or 20 years from now, it will become an emerging drug for the treatment of lung cancer.

1977
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:28,100
Then I am now at 8:16, and within a minute of my post, I will tell you about my current working environment

1978
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,900
This is the Linhai Research Station of the Institute of Cell and Biology of the Biamine Research Institute

1979
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:34,400
The Institute of Cellular and Physiological Biology has now been transformed

1980
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,300
It was my professor Zhihao at the beginning, today the teacher is sitting here today

1981
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:42,700
At the beginning, Mr. Wu was in charge of coordinating the former head of Youxi Space County

1982
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:46,600
And the chairman of Jinche came to donate this land

1983
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:51,400
Then the reminder this time was mentioned by Dean Li Yanzhe, very beautiful Lin Hai Research Station

1984
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,000
I think it's really good to do research there, but I don't understand why many students don't come

1985
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,100
If you also ask high school students every night, we will meet with six universities, and we will come to our Linhai Research Station

1986
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,600
We are researching in Linhai, saving lives regardless of each other

1987
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,880
This seaside study is beautiful inside

1988
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,240
At the beginning, when I went from England in 1992

1989
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,680
In fact, there is nothing but light here

1990
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:15,980
But now it's tree fuyin

1991
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:18,400
There's a small fountain here

1992
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,880
this is a beautiful environment

1993
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,720
This was taken when the sun was shining

1994
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,920
You don't see when the sun is bad and the storm is stormy

1995
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,600
It's even scarier when it's a typhoon

1996
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,200
Because there are no tall buildings near us to go alone

1997
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,200
so you can see the little gusts of those trees

1998
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,200
Afraid of the sun

1999
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,800
Then our seaside research in the whole structure

2000
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,200
You can see that there is a water and sky supply system here

2001
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,800
We are here to do experiments

2002
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,600
Then here is the dormitory with students or assistants

2003
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,600
When I first went there, the students were actually quite afraid of me.

2004
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,600
Because I was only in my thirties at the time

2005
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,200
I am very happy to get up at 8 o'clock in the morning to do experiments

2006
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:52,200
Before the student came, I kicked his door

2007
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:56,200
so i want to thank my students so much for being there with me

2008
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:59,200
Many students who do research years

2009
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,660
This very good place is what idea we thought of

2010
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:05,660
Immediately, you can go in there to do experiments on aquatic life.

2011
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:08,500
There are farms here, very good farms

2012
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,100
gene transfer experiments

2013
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:11,900
That's what the vice president just said

2014
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,500
Our laboratory has cooperated with Mr. Wu Jingqiao

2015
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:19,200
Then carry out the research and development of the so-called fluorescent fish

2016
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,300
Well, I didn't focus on fluorescent fish today.

2017
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,100
Actually, the glowfish is another question.

2018
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:25,500
Because I just told him that aquatic animals can get sick

2019
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,700
So we hope that this aquatic organism has anti-smoke expression

2020
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,700
That's because I don't know if you've ever raised fish

2021
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:34,300
I'm an ornamental fish. I bought ornamental fish when I was in college.

2022
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:36,900
The ornamental fish, let's say five of them, sell me 200 yuan?

2023
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,400
College students are poor, you should know

2024
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,800
Don't snatch college students for two hundred yuan, it's easy

2025
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,100
High school students are also very poor. Two hundred yuan is a lot

2026
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:45,600
Well, I bought it and raised it for a week

2027
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,400
If he hung up on me, I went to the boss and said

2028
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,700
what does he wash

2029
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,800
He said that when he cleaned his teeth, he would wash his back and his head would be thick.

2030
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:57,000
Well, then buy it, I bought it for a week and then hung it up for me

2031
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:58,000
then i will go to the boss

2032
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
That boss has been bred by me in Silin one

2033
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,400
water hog jar know how to do it later

2034
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:06,120
I'll say water pig give me some more fish

2035
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:11,140
I was wondering why the fish died every time I bought them back for a week

2036
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,780
Then I thought that after I become a teacher now

2037
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:15,400
After I worked as a research scholar

2038
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,280
I can keep this fish alive longer

2039
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,240
so i just go with that

2040
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,720
At that time, we wanted to say that anti-pregnancy

2041
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:26,360
The transplantation is using the microscopic life-assisted mode, so that he can produce anti-pregnancy even after lifting the table

2042
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,400
Then the fish will not be infected by bacteria

2043
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,400
He can fight bacteria

2044
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:34,720
However, this is only one of the main points

2045
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,760
Fish will not get sick as we are curators with the main purpose

2046
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,240
you may have forgotten

2047
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:45,040
Because what we just talked about now is to use the synthetic ecology to do it.

2048
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,640
Synthetic ecology has troubles and the price is high

2049
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,120
The student just told me

2050
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,760
Huang Hanming told me

2051
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:55,440
98% of EPI costs 780 US dollars per gram

2052
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,520
So one gram is 100 people, Miliguang costs 780 US dollars

2053
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,040
I personally feel

2054
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
may still be a bit expensive

2055
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
So we want to use fish

2056
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
You know that fish is warm

2057
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Sometimes there are hundreds of thousands of broken pieces

2058
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
it's scary, isn't it?

2059
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
soft sea tactics

2060
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
So we want to be able to get from its

2061
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
its that warm

2062
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
In the residual heat process

2063
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
In the future, these anti-halo

2064
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
it also extracts

2065
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Because now it's easy to do protein expression

2066
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Then you must be curious to ask me

2067
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Why don't you use a colon induction?

2068
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Because high school or college students

2069
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I have a speech today

2070
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
or friends online

2071
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
you are on the internet

2072
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
should ask me this question

2073
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Why not use colon induction

2074
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
or as we express the system

2075
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
there are many things now

2076
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
indescribable

2077
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
we are also doing

2078
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Trying hard to do colon induction

2079
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Anti-stunning

2080
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Basically it shows

2081
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
would kill yourself to behave

2082
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
that gut feeling

2083
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
this is very troublesome

2084
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
but if fish

2085
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
fish it doesn't show it

2086
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
protein

2087
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
expressed protein

2088
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
won't kill the fish

2089
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
look how happy it is

2090
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
how fast it shines

2091
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
so we are probably

2092
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,020
The original idea of ​​doing anti-response posture, there are probably two kinds of ideas

2093
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:04,800
I hope you will buy it back later

2094
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,960
call later

2095
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,160
students are poor

2096
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,460
200 yuan is really a lot

2097
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:12,820
This time we have genetically transferred equipment at the Linhai Research Station is very beautiful

2098
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:17,020
In the whole of Taiwan, there was no gene transfer in Qigu

2099
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:19,940
Field testing is also very missed when

2100
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:21,860
The Linhai Research Station should cover all of Asia

2101
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:25,360
Or the most advanced genetically modified job in all of Taiwan or all of Asia

2102
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,600
Don't be afraid of anything running out

2103
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,260
or a problem with field testing

2104
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,940
It's still the same now we have a lot of that

2105
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:35,800
the interception system or the processing system

2106
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,860
Then the genetic transfer at the Linhai Research Station just started

2107
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:39,560
It's all beautiful now

2108
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:44,460
A very modern testing ground

2109
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,220
In the end, I still want to thank you all

2110
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:49,700
I spent so much time listening to me today

2111
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:53,200
I wish you all the best of health

2112
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,520
The most important thing is to welcome you all when you are free

2113
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:59,020
Come to Linhai Research Station to give us encouragement

2114
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:00,040
of course to encourage

2115
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,480
Someone needs to be more willing, especially a graduate student

2116
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,600
Welcome to our inspiration research station to do research

2117
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:12,360
Then I know that there may be some pharmaceutical companies interested in investing on the Internet

2118
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:17,500
Please come and talk to us about our accounting

2119
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,360
Then how to help us develop

2120
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:24,380
At least don't make me 15 or 20 years, just make me dead for 15 years

2121
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:32,020
Then help everyone to be more promising on some antibacterial effects

2122
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:33,340
Thanks

2123
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:42,100
Thank you, thank you very much Dr. Chen for a very wonderful presentation

2124
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:47,300
Then I wonder if you have anything to ask Dr. Chen about?

2125
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:47,900
later

2126
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:53,860
The anti-Qing platform is the one that is moving overnight

2127
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:56,620
Just to avoid that leftover field

2128
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:59,860
Does that mean

2129
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,580
A chair that lives where the night is cloudy

2130
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:10,380
It may find that the more powerful the viewing platform

2131
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:12,220
like a mud mound or something

2132
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:14,760
Would it be better than being in a stone pound chair

2133
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:17,420
this theory is good

2134
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:19,460
but i don't know

2135
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:22,500
Because I only feel that the whole fish

2136
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,620
This should be in terms of evolution

2137
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:26,620
Because the whole fish evolution process

2138
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:28,920
i can't tell you

2139
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,680
Do you live in the dirty water at night?

2140
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:32,480
Although I just said

2141
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,480
But that's universal

2142
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,280
if it is like this

2143
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:40,160
I think the fish in our Sifenxi should be more resistant

2144
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:43,760
There should be many

2145
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:44,960
Everyone seems to see a sign

2146
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,320
No arrest, right?

2147
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:51,160
At present, it is just looking for ecology from Mimisheng

2148
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:53,560
Or other animals have early

2149
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,000
that's the first question

2150
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,400
The second question is to say

2151
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,960
Ecology Can Kill Morbidity

2152
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,160
Will it affect normal cells?

2153
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:07,920
The third one seems to me that I heard you said that in that

2154
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:12,640
So far, it has not been formally used in humans

2155
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,600
like this

2156
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:19,760
But I seem to have heard on the Internet that there are direct sellers selling this product

2157
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,960
don't know you know what this is all about

2158
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,880
do you have a problem

2159
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,880
Anti-morbid at certain concentrations

2160
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,640
above a certain concentration

2161
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:34,480
It will be normal cells will be destroyed according to the disaster

2162
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,240
kill normal cells

2163
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,760
so we usually

2164
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,880
I'm giving a popular science speech today

2165
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,880
So I didn't spend a lot of time fixing it here

2166
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,160
we have a few in the lab

2167
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,640
So if students or researchers in our lab

2168
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,800
We will first test for cytotoxicity

2169
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,160
this is the first step

2170
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,600
The second step is when it comes time to develop the drug

2171
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,080
to test some of its body

2172
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:06,140
Like GOTGPT or those things, see what dosage is best

2173
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,980
This answers your first question, his political cells are toxic, there is nothing wrong

2174
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:14,600
But Dependent still depends on different anti-pathological conditions, I have read some reports

2175
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:16,640
Some antipathogens are non-cytotoxic

2176
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:20,740
But he has the function of so-called cellular immune regulation

2177
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,780
Its bactericidal effect is not that strong

2178
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:28,680
Usually less toxic means that its ability to kill bacteria is not so strong

2179
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:33,540
So we have to adjust a very good dosage, just like you take Kangshengsu

2180
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,840
You also have to find a good dose

2181
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,440
Excessive health vitamins can also cause

2182
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:40,960
bad situation happens

2183
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:42,240
right

2184
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,080
The second problem is that I forgot

2185
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:50,700
do you mind talking to me again

2186
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:55,560
It seems that the Internet is selling that thing in the market

2187
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,600
I don't know how to answer this question

2188
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,860
because i told you

2189
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,260
In fact, you can see that Sikamai is also sold in the market

2190
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,380
You can buy our anti-momentum

2191
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,360
Yes, it is for sale

2192
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:11,640
But let me say one more thing

2193
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:14,500
In fact, ten years ago, when I was in the anti-mobility posture,

2194
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:17,980
At that time, there were not many people in the world doing anti-movement

2195
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:19,380
not not many people

2196
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:23,440
It is in Japan, mainland China, Taiwan, Southeast Asian countries

2197
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:27,640
These Asian countries do not have a lot of manpower to go

2198
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:31,240
Mainland China's anti-transportation attitude is really poisonous

2199
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:34,440
I heard they have become a special zone to do anti-movement

2200
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:36,940
So they called an anti-motion state Sikobon

2201
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:39,340
It is the anti-motion state obtained on the forehead

2202
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:41,440
Has been sold to the so-called Tianjian toilet

2203
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,840
Tian Jian went down

2204
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,040
can be bought

2205
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,640
yes , so i am a little worried too

2206
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:50,240
Will there be waist resistance in the future?

2207
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,240
yes it is available for purchase

2208
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:54,640
but that's not

2209
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:55,940
no

2210
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:59,040
Not American DA or Taiwan

2211
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Taiwan's Drug Inspection Bureau has licensed it to be sold in the form of drugs

2212
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,480
Like we went to buy from Sikama

2213
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:11,200
It's just a substance sold to you

2214
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:14,800
No one can control how you use it

2215
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,000
Ask for advice

2216
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
just saw that on video

2217
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Fish with cancer in antibacterial water

2218
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
That cancerous tumor can disappear

2219
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:40,000
This means that the antibacterial state can cure cancer

2220
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
so should we eat more fish

2221
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
But the fish is different from the fish you just had

2222
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Do other fish also have antibacterial properties?

2223
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Thanks

2224
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
i just said

2225
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Antibacterial water is also present in your body

2226
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
but we don't eat people

2227
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
We eat fish for

2228
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
It is hoped that in the future through the process of aquaculture

2229
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,020
I have another interesting story for you

2230
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:07,920
Some people are collecting what I just said

2231
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,820
Isn't everyone immune to fishing?

2232
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:13,220
Some people are collecting fish immunity

2233
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:17,680
Then he took it as a sort of antibacterial substance

2234
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:19,180
down to do business

2235
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:22,380
then all fish will have an antibacterial status

2236
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:25,820
As far as I can tell since you're not eating fish

2237
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:26,900
is aquatic organisms

2238
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:31,380
So that oyster will also have an antibacterial status

2239
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:36,580
But among all the fish species

2240
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:39,920
Why do I especially choose grouper and silky fish

2241
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:43,380
Because grouper and blackbone are very important aquaculture industries in Taiwan

2242
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:46,420
I hope that the process of giving a speech today is not just about

2243
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:50,220
We use the antibacterial state to do it in medical medicine

2244
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:51,900
I also want to let everyone know

2245
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:57,100
Aquaculture is actually Taiwan's inherent aquaculture such as grouper and black bone fish

2246
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:00,020
A breed that has been in Taiwan for so long

2247
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,020
The industry also hopes to attract everyone's attention

2248
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:04,520
Later you go out on the street

2249
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:07,860
Please choose more of these kinds of juban fish and five countries fish to eat

2250
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:10,900
The multi-selected juban fish and five countries fish to eat

2251
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:14,220
It can also promote the vigorous development of our flood farming industry

2252
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:18,900
They all eat the fish bred by this Shuizi sheep

2253
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:22,260
Are you eating too much healthy food?

2254
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:24,820
fish in water

2255
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:28,660
In fact, the government now does so-called barcode tracking

2256
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:32,000
I don't know that you actually learned from the process of the ten-fish industry

2257
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,620
As long as you are in Taipei Agricultural Products

2258
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:36,820
It has a similar

2259
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:39,600
Similar to that black Q barcode

2260
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,720
According to the future it will have a production history

2261
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:44,460
Tell you which factory this fish came from

2262
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:48,160
Then it seems that it will also test whether the fish has health vitamins

2263
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:50,720
The government is actually doing a good job of checking the gates now.

2264
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:54,760
That's just something I remember happening before some decamp farms

2265
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:57,360
It seems that there is no way through this system

2266
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,960
However, it was found to contain

2267
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,840
Many chemicals or antibiotics

2268
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:07,240
So I still encourage everyone to eat more fish

2269
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:11,000
Please trust Taiwanese aquaculture farmers

2270
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Let's see if Yuntai cooks it

2271
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
It's also an interesting question

2272
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
recently

2273
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
The deputy dean asked an interesting question

2274
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Do you all want to eat fish after fighting the Taizhu?

2275
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I also encourage everyone to eat more fish today

2276
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Will there be no small children in the future after resisting the Taizhu?

2277
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Just cook at 100 degrees C

2278
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Only recently did this result

2279
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
And published on PoS1

2280
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
After cooking at 100 degrees C, when you did not cook

2281
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
About double the MIC will kill bacteria

2282
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
After cooking, it still has the effect of killing bacteria

2283
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
We have an anti-response too

2284
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
very interesting

2285
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
so we just saw that

2286
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
That TP4 that can heal the beautiful feeling

2287
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
you know the acid in the stomach is sour

2288
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
PH4 or something

2289
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
But it still has bactericidal ability in acidic environment

2290
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
10 minutes to 60 minutes

2291
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
It still has a bactericidal effect

2292
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:07,000
We put it in the Vickers tube, put it in the water and boil it for a hundred degrees, instead of closing the whole water

2293
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Just put it in two Vickers tubes and let him cook like this

2294
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Turns out he's still active, which I find interesting

2295
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:26,000
So we want to know that under normal conditions, Teacher Xu Junzhen is actually a teacher from National Taiwan University

2296
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:32,000
He was before, before he had the whole structure of doing anti-motion

2297
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:42,000
He has made the structure under long-term temperature, but I have not told him what kind of changes will happen to the structure after being cooked for a hundred times.

2298
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Why does it still have the ability to sterilize bacteria, listen up

2299
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Hello, that is, I have seen one before, which is vitamin D, which can improve the body's anti-mobility effect

2300
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Is this true?

2301
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
why? thanks

2302
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,500
Vincent book D?

2303
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:04,500
Yes, Vincent Shu D

2304
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:08,000
Then Pei Baowang published it in the series with the prefix N?

2305
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I have seen a similar article, but I did not read carefully

2306
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
this question...

2307
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I don't know either

2308
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
you ask me like this

2309
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Teacher Bao Wang D can help me add

2310
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
I can guess, because general antibiotics...

2311
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Which paragraph does this follow?

2312
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,500
right

2313
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,500
General antibiotics its structure

2314
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:32,500
just... sorry

2315
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,500
This antibiotic has no specific structure for its structure

2316
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,500
But when it encounters the state of Zilong sex

2317
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,500
It will be easier to appear as it just said

2318
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,500
Two sides... that is, one side is Zilong sex

2319
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:42,500
One side is the structure on the front

2320
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,500
Also in the time of pure water dragon sex

2321
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:45,500
It is not this structure

2322
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,500
Then encounter...Wen Shengshu D's purple dragon...

2323
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,500
Or the environment of Zilong sex

2324
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,500
It is easy to show that the effective structure

2325
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:54,500
So relatively its bactericidal ability will be better

2326
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:57,500
Go ahead... also for us...

2327
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:00,500
Our understanding of antibacterial ecology is like this

2328
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,500
Just mentioned the heating issue

2329
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:06,100
In fact, this protein is a structure of more than 20 amino acids

2330
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:09,120
Assuming that because its structure is originally no structure

2331
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,600
Only when encountering this environment will the structure

2332
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:13,100
So after you group it, its structure is messed up

2333
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:15,600
But when it encounters a child-like environment

2334
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,900
it structure comes back

2335
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:18,400
So maybe this can be explained by

2336
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,700
Why is it still active after grouping

2337
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:24,200
that just mentioned

2338
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,100
if you eat this

2339
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:27,700
May be hydrolyzed by my stomach acid

2340
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:29,600
Of course it won't help

2341
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,400
But stomach acid is what I just

2342
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,600
that I guessed next is

2343
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,000
We just made that time mention

2344
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,300
It is in the sour environment that it has

2345
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:40,200
In the process of the protein not working

2346
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:43,100
It still retains the activity of its MIC

2347
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:44,900
So now we are surprised

2348
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:47,100
why does it have that activity

2349
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:49,400
after the group

2350
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,600
Either in an acid environment or a subtractive environment

2351
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,200
We have done B 2 to 14

2352
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,600
24,6,80,12,14

2353
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,000
We found between 4 and 12

2354
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
it still holds

2355
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,500
After being released in a private yard for a period of time

2356
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:08,000
He still picks it up to make MIC, he still has the energy to sterilize

2357
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
we have done recently

2358
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
very interesting

2359
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
I do not know why either

2360
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Maybe it's really similar to what Mr. Liao Wenwei said

2361
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Hello, teacher

2362
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I want to ask you a question

2363
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
i saw the dog test

2364
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
After he beat him in with that MAS

2365
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000
We saw that the teacher still has

2366
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Do the treatment in Bless Cancer

2367
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Does he have the same plan like this

2368
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Let women's Bless Cancer

2369
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
He was hired by MVT

2370
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Does he have the same effect

2371
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
If this treatment

2372
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
he is a little scary

2373
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Is there such a plan

2374
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
What kind of treatment is his treatment

2375
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,000
that kind of dog

2376
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
he's actually quite funny

2377
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,400
because we are experimenting with rats

2378
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,800
we're on cell experiments

2379
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,500
we actually feel

2380
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:08,100
The antibacterial tires you just saw

2381
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:11,100
it is the way to go the cell statue

2382
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:12,800
but you see in animals

2383
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:18,200
In fact, there is data similar to cell necrosis

2384
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:21,800
so we

2385
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:25,200
At that time, I didn't go down to ask

2386
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,100
exist...

2387
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:28,000
Because it is very troublesome in Taiwan

2388
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,200
It's a dog experiment

2389
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:34,500
Our dog is not

2390
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:36,200
Everyone imagines it made with beagle

2391
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:40,000
Because when we made this plan

2392
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,600
COA said that if we use beagle to make

2393
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:45,800
It absolutely swallowed up our plan.

2394
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:46,400
I think...

2395
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,800
So because there are...

2396
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:53,000
We are doing a project in that agricultural bio-type fruitamine therapy plan

2397
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,800
So but one thing it allows us to do is

2398
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:58,200
This dog is a stray dog

2399
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:00,000
Or a dog brought by the master

2400
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Those four groups can let us do this experiment with their consent

2401
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,000
But when it came, some tumors were very large.

2402
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
when we call in

2403
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
After a while that Petite

2404
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Because of the volume we play sometimes

2405
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
To be honest, it doesn't have a lot of dogs

2406
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
So sometimes that air

2407
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,000
I think it might look a bit

2408
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
just overdose

2409
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
so overdose

2410
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Its anti-morbidity is actually inside the cells

2411
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
I think there is really something

2412
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
As the gentleman just said, it has cytotoxic effect

2413
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
So after he killed the cells

2414
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
A condition that becomes necrotic

2415
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
That's on Lu Lai

2416
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Because our family has not yet

2417
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
We can only be Lulai on the ancestors

2418
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Lu Lai, we haven't done animal experiments yet

2419
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
because we also want to find

2420
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
There are dogs that specialize in Lulai

2421
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:55,000
or someone willing to take it to an animal hospital

2422
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
and then treated by a physician

2423
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
His dog is Lu Lai

2424
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,700
so-called trinity breast cancer

2425
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:03,600
we have to wait again for this

2426
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,600
So in the whole animal experiments

2427
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:09,000
We currently have no more detailed information to tell you

2428
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,500
But just that picture

2429
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:13,300
The one with breast cancer and the one with breast cancer

2430
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:17,200
In fact, the picture of the breast cancer is on the Internet

2431
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:19,800
We may all see

2432
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:20,900
girl getting breast cancer

2433
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:23,100
If you accidentally get triple breast cancer

2434
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:26,800
And then at the end not very early on

2435
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:31,700
In the end, her wound will fester

2436
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:33,600
you can see the bones

2437
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:36,600
In principle, we just hope

2438
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:38,500
hope to develop some kind of

2439
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:41,000
You can see that we have information about Shao Shangchang

2440
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,500
We want to develop some kind of paint

2441
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,700
because it can be applied to her wounds

2442
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:49,600
It can also close the wound and kill cancer cells

2443
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,800
Now we just want to do experiments like this in the future

2444
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,700
But the trouble with this experiment is that you have to

2445
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:56,900
I just reported to you

2446
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:59,800
Just to find the crooked dog

2447
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,440
Then there's Trinity Breast Cancer again

2448
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:06,640
Then you can't use rice to cut milk

2449
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,520
so this will cost

2450
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:10,940
So Su Wu shepherds for 18 years

2451
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:12,480
I may have to pasture for 20 years

2452
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:13,640
that's the factor

2453
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:14,600
To wait for

2454
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,840
Some of our experiments

2455
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:19,980
You may have seen me talking here for less than an hour

2456
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:20,880
more than an hour

2457
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,400
People say that one minute on stage and one minute off stage

2458
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,600
We've probably been doing it for ten years

2459
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:26,600
right

2460
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:29,400
So please forgive our speed

2461
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:30,680
why so slow

2462
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:33,000
I also wish it could be faster

2463
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Thanks

2464
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,680
i want to ask

2465
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:42,040
May I ask how much EP1 a fish will have

2466
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:45,440
It is anti bacteria peptide

2467
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:46,200
a fish

2468
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:47,400
finish your question

2469
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:48,200
I have no idea

2470
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:49,280
that or

2471
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,480
If you want to get imminigrant

2472
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:54,320
How many fish do you need to extract to get

2473
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,280
good question again

2474
01:39:56,280 --> 01:40:00,040
We don't extract from fish

2475
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
We use the model of synthetic cards to

2476
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
use ecology

2477
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Ecos can now be crafted with Ecosynthesis

2478
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
It is a machine that can synthesize

2479
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
No need to kill a chicken and take its soft

2480
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,000
We can use machines to synthesize ecology

2481
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Excuse me

2482
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
If you eat fish

2483
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Which part do you want us to eat to be more rewarding?

2484
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Is it fish skin?

2485
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
or what to eat

2486
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
good question

2487
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I don't know how to answer

2488
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,000
When I first started thinking about this topic

2489
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I hope everyone can eat more fish in the future

2490
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Then promote the development of our residual farming industry

2491
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
that kidney

2492
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Attracted by this topic

2493
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Know the residual farming industry

2494
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
It's an interesting creature in language

2495
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
sorry i have one last question

2496
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Excuse me

2497
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
If we only treat this

2498
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Antibacterial peptide to bacteria

2499
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
and in a test tube

2500
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,840
Then eventually, do you think it will still have a Resistant in the end?

2501
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:09,640
Yes, this is something I haven’t dared to talk about just now, and I haven’t talked about it yet

2502
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:17,400
Now based on the current literature report, it is reported that there is no antibacterial bacteria produced in nature

2503
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:20,920
But we are in the laboratory, and some literatures have reported

2504
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:25,360
Antimicrobial bacteria can be produced in the artificial mode in the laboratory

2505
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:27,640
I just had a picture to tell you

2506
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:32,360
In the antibacterial state, it will actually enter the bacteria, from DNA to RNA, to the process of protein

2507
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:36,800
that also produces what's called an antimicrobial state of bacteria

2508
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,840
But in our lab I once had a research creature that was also interesting

2509
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:46,480
I asked him to help me deal with the bacteria with EPI

2510
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:53,080
At the beginning, did we pull the MIC from 1/10 or 1/4?

2511
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:58,240
Keep dealing with us until the end seems to be able to reach 10 times the MIC

2512
01:41:58,240 --> 01:41:59,960
But bacteria can still freeze eggs

2513
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:12,300
But I didn't continue to do the experiment later, because originally this experiment should be doing the so-called molecular biology tool called Potonomic,

2514
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:19,200
It is to let the so-called two-dimensional capacitance sudden change interview to see what protein has changed,

2515
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:23,400
But because of the relationship between ability and financial resources at that time, we did not continue to do it.

2516
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:32,400
Let’s still quote what I just said at the beginning, we want to be like Switzerland, our laboratory is orderly like Switzerland,

2517
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:38,800
We want to be small and beautiful, so I focus on doing other things and keep asking,

2518
01:42:41,300 --> 01:42:48,900
Should it still be the skin, that is, the skin or the intestinal tract is the main source?

2519
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:55,900
No, the anti-smoke carbon actually comes from other sources. For example, there is an anti-smoke carbon called Hip-Cidine.

2520
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:58,900
H-E-P-C-I-D-I-N, which is produced by the liver,

2521
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,740
It just came out of human urine when it was discovered

2522
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:06,140
Payback here is posted on JB7

2523
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:09,940
It is from human urine to perform the so-called HPLC

2524
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:11,940
Then found a Farcman inside

2525
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:15,620
It found that there is a so-called antibacterial effect

2526
01:43:15,620 --> 01:43:19,340
So it still thinks to go back and trace this gene

2527
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:22,520
Where does its product come from?

2528
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:26,360
Our more interesting question is to say

2529
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:29,460
all the fish in every organ

2530
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:32,120
In fact, we do RNA analysis

2531
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:36,920
We can know that there will be so-called EPI in almost every place

2532
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:40,420
But on the epidermis, it produces more RNA

2533
01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:41,420
right

2534
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:44,420
professor again

2535
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:48,420
The professor advocated to eat more of this oxygen fish

2536
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:50,660
Because it contains antibacterial properties, right?

2537
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:55,520
In this way, if we often eat this oxygen fish contains antibacterial

2538
01:43:55,520 --> 01:44:00,520
Does that reduce our overall inflammation?

2539
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,740
Eating more fish will make the body less prone to inflammation

2540
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:05,540
Is it this way

2541
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:06,040
Thanks

2542
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:07,540
I dare not talk about this issue again

2543
01:44:07,540 --> 01:44:09,040
But I think eating more fish is good

2544
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:11,040
Because there are DH and NTM on the fish

2545
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:18,040
Then it seems that the fish is also better than the four-horned animal. Will I be killed?

2546
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:23,040
Fish is also a better source of meat than four-horned animals.

2547
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,040
It's also better quality

2548
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,540
I think it should be like this

2549
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:31,540
Eating more fish, I think, should have some effect on immune inflammation

2550
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:33,540
Because we usually eat cod liver oil?

2551
01:44:33,540 --> 01:44:36,540
Cod liver oil has been verified to have some DHEPA

2552
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:41,540
Our laboratory has conducted experiments on EPA and DHEPA in inhibiting immune inflammation

2553
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:47,540
Well, we have recently verified that it really suppresses immune inflammation.

2554
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:52,540
ok four people please

2555
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:54,540
Hello, teacher

2556
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:57,540
What I want to ask is the ecological center

2557
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:07,600
Have you thought about modifying several amino acid regions to change its function like this?

2558
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:12,920
Recently, edited by Paver in the so-called Science Report

2559
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:15,360
On a magazine called Scientist Report

2560
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:19,600
Someone used two Modify and two amino acids

2561
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:23,800
It can be successfully expressed in the protein expression system

2562
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:25,360
we are doing this too

2563
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:31,520
But for now, I still want to go back to what you said just now that we want to do

2564
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:36,320
But we're still waiting for the mayor's financial and human input.

2565
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:48,960
Let me add so as not to mislead everyone that you can be sterilized just to eat fish

2566
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:55,520
When you have liver disease, it's not just eating fish that can cure liver disease

2567
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:57,760
Then the food goes down and is digested by the food

2568
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:00,080
Basically this has been broken down

2569
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,960
The case of becoming a single low and single short paragraph counts

2570
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:04,200
He may no longer have the ability to fight bacteria

2571
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:07,960
Please don't mislead everyone

2572
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:09,800
just mentioned

2573
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:11,760
Some antimicrobial products are commercially available

2574
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,360
That thing depends on how you use it

2575
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:14,300
if you just eat it

2576
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:17,060
I believe it's probably 99.99% broken down

2577
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:17,960
probably useless

2578
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:19,860
So don't take it easy on the Internet

2579
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:22,160
Which antibacterial product to buy can treat what

2580
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:24,260
And you eat and fight

2581
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:26,360
completely different from a certain effect

2582
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:29,260
And the bacteria it kills may be completely different infections

2583
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:31,620
So don't buy it for yourself

2584
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:32,620
right

2585
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:35,060
Recently, there seems to be a so-called marine ecology on the Internet

2586
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:36,460
A lot of people

2587
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:40,220
I saw on the Internet that there is a so-called marine ecology for sale

2588
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:42,120
eat and fight

2589
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:43,920
Actually it's a different story

2590
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:46,960
What I said today is that I hope everyone eats fish

2591
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,220
Eating fish and killing bacteria like you are two different things

2592
01:46:49,220 --> 01:46:51,120
Yes, Mr. Liao thinks

2593
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:53,160
But I encourage everyone to eat fish because I hope to be able to

2594
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:55,560
Everyone attaches great importance to the industry of water beach farming

2595
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:58,260
I hope everyone eats more fish

2596
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,120
So I add carbon dioxide to beef

2597
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:07,000
So eating more fish won't cause this kind of problem

2598
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,400
My purpose is to hope that everyone can eat more fish

2599
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:11,200
Pay more attention to the aquaculture industry

2600
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:13,200
Best Seas

2601
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:14,640
please teach me

2602
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:16,080
Chen Jiaojiao

2603
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:19,240
Do you think the three are easier to obtain

2604
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:21,640
Or is it better to say that these three effects are better?

2605
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:23,440
good question

2606
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:26,000
In fact, because when I went to Linhai Research Station,

2607
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,760
I still have to tell my history

2608
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:30,840
When going to Linhai Research Station

2609
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:32,360
At first we just hoped

2610
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:35,000
Make a little contribution to Taiwan's aquaculture industry

2611
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,520
The aquaculture industry was

2612
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:38,800
On the turtle fish is the albino coccus infection

2613
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,600
The grouper is infected with viruses and bacteria

2614
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:48,200
So I started with these two types of fish as animals for my experiments

2615
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:51,920
Do you know what I mean

2616
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:55,800
right

2617
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:58,400
Do you have any other questions

2618
01:47:58,400 --> 01:47:59,440
Since grouper

2619
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,760
These fish have their own antimicrobial ecology

2620
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:07,440
But these bacteria can still infect these animals

2621
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:13,120
So it must be said that only ecologists kill a certain bacterium

2622
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:15,560
But other bacteria still won't kill

2623
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:18,480
So this fish can also be infected by bacteria

2624
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:19,160
right

2625
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:21,480
Teacher Liao asked a question

2626
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:27,640
It is similar to antibiotics that have the so-called broad-spectrum effect and load-carrying effect

2627
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:31,080
The antibacterial ecology is the same, there is a so-called broad-spectrum antibacterial ecology

2628
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:33,560
Antibacterial Ecology with Loading Effect

2629
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:34,640
I just gave that example

2630
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:36,880
That is to say, a HIP-STIDM was found on humans

2631
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:38,600
HEP-CIDM

2632
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:42,200
We also found this antibacterial ecology on turtle fish

2633
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:44,560
It is the so-called load-carrying antimicrobial ecology

2634
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:47,080
For example, it may only kill certain types of bacteria

2635
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:50,640
API can actually kill many, many bacteria

2636
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:53,240
it's like in our movie

2637
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:55,800
It is a broad-spectrum bacterium

2638
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:58,160
Broad-spectrum antimicrobial ecology

2639
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:06,700
Not for this fish will it be

2640
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:10,000
It may take further research to find out.

2641
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:21,700
May I ask that Kang Juntai how to lock the pathogen

2642
01:49:21,700 --> 01:49:24,200
what he wants

2643
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:26,300
Just said a certain concentration

2644
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:28,100
In fact, Shanghai will destroy normal cells

2645
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:34,200
at lower concentrations

2646
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:37,400
Just like normal cells and pathogenic cells

2647
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:41,400
How does Kang Juntai lock the cells of pathogens?

2648
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:43,300
then go from his pattern

2649
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:44,900
you asked another very interesting question

2650
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:46,000
This is what we have said

2651
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,700
Because hand in hand to many molecular mechanisms

2652
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:51,600
simply means to say

2653
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:54,300
Kang Juntai has the so-called water-clearing and water-carrying properties

2654
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:57,000
On normal cells and on bacteria

2655
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,000
The composition of his cell membrane or cell arm is the same as that of normal cells

2656
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,400
normal cells are different

2657
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:03,160
So Kangkang will suffer from this

2658
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:05,360
This leading force to

2659
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:06,760
so-called bacterial

2660
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:09,760
It's the reason why the positive and negative are finer

2661
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:11,360
he will be drawn to it

2662
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:13,040
will not be compared with normal cells at low concentrations

2663
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:15,160
done at very low concentrations

2664
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:17,160
interaction like this

2665
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:19,160
right

2666
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:25,160
what's the problem

2667
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:27,160
students high school students have

2668
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:28,160
Yes or no

2669
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:30,160
Excuse me

2670
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:32,160
can i ask the professor a question

2671
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:34,160
That's Kang Juntae

2672
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:36,160
mainly in the cell volume

2673
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:38,160
still in cell pool

2674
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:40,160
that's what i saw

2675
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,160
Someone on the internet wrote that

2676
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:44,160
He is the cell

2677
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:46,160
After bacteria eat

2678
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:48,160
Then use the container to enter the food bubble

2679
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:50,160
break down the bacteria

2680
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:53,160
You said that Kang Juntai eats bacteria

2681
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:55,160
no is

2682
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:57,160
that's the time

2683
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:59,160
Test cells

2684
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:01,160
dead cells

2685
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,440
after eating the bacteria

2686
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:05,220
it forms a food bubble

2687
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:06,940
Then dissolve and go in

2688
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:09,480
Is the antibacterial Taiwan really in the solution?

2689
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:11,480
no antibacterial Taiwan in solution

2690
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:14,320
I am in antibacterial Taiwan it will not go to dissolve

2691
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:16,020
Because there are too many enzymes in the solution

2692
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:17,680
it will take it away

2693
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,120
will break it down

2694
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:22,280
So why did we just talk about antibacterial tables

2695
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:24,680
Will you be afraid of the role of eggs from plums?

2696
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:26,280
because you have a good idea

2697
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:27,120
I

2698
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:28,400
you ask him this question

2699
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,160
I ask to do

2700
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:31,640
I have another question for you

2701
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:35,280
In the process of cancer drug development

2702
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:35,840
do you know

2703
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:36,880
There will be liposomes

2704
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,440
buy so-called chemically synthesized drugs

2705
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:40,760
like cranberries

2706
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,320
Then the cranberries are brought into the cells

2707
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:44,720
When cancer cells go inside

2708
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:47,000
It marks the time when the drug is brought into the cancer cell

2709
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:49,040
Why is this chemically synthesized drug

2710
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:50,600
it can kill that cancer cell

2711
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:53,520
because it is in the so-called Libosome

2712
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:54,960
That's when liposomes are brought in

2713
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:57,880
Usually go to the Lysofone you just mentioned

2714
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:00,040
close up

2715
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:07,000
In the agricultural media, it is a chemically synthesized drug, so it will not be hydrolyzed by these

2716
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:16,000
At the beginning, our laboratory also wanted to wrap it in the liposome, hold it in the hand, and send it to the cell.

2717
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Then through the same picture is to kill the cells, but it is so dead, this experiment has not been done

2718
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:27,000
After discussing with the teachers of the Chemistry Institute, it was just when Mr. Li Xianqiong was discussing

2719
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:34,000
He told me that this will definitely be borrowed by the agricultural media and agricultural disintegration, so this way is not feasible

2720
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Exactly like this, so we didn't do cell experiments

2721
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:49,000
I speculate that the anti-disease is secreted outside the so-called cells, and kills the bacteria first

2722
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Then some giant cells will gobble it up, like this

2723
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:59,000
It should not be in the agricultural media

2724
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Excuse me, professor, I would like to ask a question

2725
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:12,000
It was the time when the Anti-Tai Army committed suicide and killed the Aijin continuation package

2726
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:18,000
He does not need to adjust a specific concentration to produce a specific cell

2727
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
just be able to kill him

2728
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
So the question I want to ask is

2729
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Can he kill this?

2730
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Will he be able to hit the ground running or will he stay there

2731
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Other Aijin Sequel Packs

2732
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Then consider the study of love stem cells

2733
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Is it very likely that he will relapse

2734
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
You asked a good question too

2735
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Now that you are admitted to the graduate school, can you come to my laboratory?

2736
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
do an experiment

2737
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Pull the graduate first

2738
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
really good question for you

2739
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
meeting

2740
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
He can't kill all the love cells

2741
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
so we just saw

2742
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
This is what I told my lab colleagues

2743
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
This is what our first generation thought

2744
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,000
In fact, the first generation of this process

2745
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
everyone is very

2746
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Everyone can general laboratory

2747
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,000
everyone is very

2748
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:05,000
We now have ideas for second-generation drug development

2749
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
However, since it has not been made

2750
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
So it's not convenient for me to talk to you here

2751
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
You can wait a minute and I will tell you later

2752
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Because many people will know

2753
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:17,000
then we are a small laboratory

2754
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
you just saw there were only a few cats

2755
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,000
my thoughts i think there are a lot of fresh ideas

2756
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,000
It's not really suitable for you to listen to it under the hall broadcast

2757
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
except i made it

2758
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I'll tell you when I succeed

2759
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
We want to develop second generation drugs

2760
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,000
It can be similar to the current targeted drug

2761
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
it only targets cancer cells

2762
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
to the cancer cell

2763
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Antibacterial tires will kill that special cancer cell

2764
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
including cancer cells as well as bacteria

2765
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
That is to say, from the broad-spectrum antibacterial

2766
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Make it antibacterial only against certain bacteria

2767
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Antibacterial tires against certain bacteria

2768
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Biotechnology should be able to do it now

2769
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
but we're going to try

2770
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
None of us should have done this

2771
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,000
we have seen cooperation

2772
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
wait we have that idea

2773
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,280
So when I'm done

2774
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:04,280
if successful

2775
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:05,840
I will listen

2776
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:07,200
I'll wait and hear what we think

2777
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:08,540
but you don't

2778
01:55:17,260 --> 01:55:20,440
He'll be like an antibody, a mutation that's never passed on

2779
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:21,440
mutation mutation

2780
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:22,160
disease resistance

2781
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:22,800
he will

2782
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:23,360
he will be like

2783
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:23,800
Won't

2784
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:25,480
He's basically an elite constant

2785
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:26,960
he won't mutate

2786
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:28,200
you say something like

2787
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:29,800
similar bacterial mutation

2788
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:30,360
right

2789
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:32,240
He doesn't look like a bacterial mutation

2790
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:35,040
The question is like an antibody

2791
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:35,800
Is it an antibody

2792
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:36,840
Object antibody

2793
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:37,840
Antibody V region

2794
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:38,440
V region

2795
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:40,640
Does the row produce antibodies?

2796
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:41,280
no

2797
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:42,640
Will there be a change

2798
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:49,760
But

2799
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:52,760
The anti-disease he does not use antibodies

2800
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:54,160
idea to sterilize

2801
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:56,600
He went directly to sterilize by himself

2802
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:58,360
He said it will keep changing

2803
01:55:58,360 --> 01:55:59,040
Won't

2804
01:55:59,040 --> 01:55:59,840
Antibodies won't

2805
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:05,720
Because he's an ATGOTTG he's a certain gene product

2806
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:07,100
Do bacteria have a gene?

2807
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:08,200
bacteria

2808
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:13,800
Bacteria will target this type of antibacterial state to

2809
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:17,900
Yes, so this time I just repeated the report to you

2810
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:21,900
Now in the state of artificial synthetic mode in the laboratory

2811
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:24,800
We are bacteria that can find antimicrobial states

2812
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:28,300
However, there has not been any report in the natural environment

2813
01:56:28,300 --> 01:56:31,900
tell us that there are bacteria that are resistant to certain antibacterial states

2814
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:37,900
I just think it's in the process of evolution

2815
01:56:37,900 --> 01:56:40,200
Maybe there is a change in the antibacterial status

2816
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:42,000
isn't it? in the process of evolution

2817
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,400
Yes, you want to talk about how the antibacterial state evolves

2818
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:49,100
To the question of the evolution of the antimicrobial state

2819
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:51,000
I can't answer you

2820
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,500
Although I have always wanted to find us Lin Yaying

2821
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:55,700
Just when another teacher called Mr. Taitian

2822
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:56,700
He seems to be doing evolution

2823
01:56:56,700 --> 01:56:59,800
Then I want to ask him how to evolve to do experiments

2824
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,700
But I still have to go back

2825
01:57:01,700 --> 01:57:05,700
Because every day in the laboratory we are still a small satellite TV small scale

2826
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:09,000
We can only do research on certain research topics

2827
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
yes too many questions

2828
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:14,000
What everyone was concerned about just now is that

2829
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:18,500
Will this antibacterial tire be treated for a long time?

2830
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:21,000
Those pathogenic bacteria were originally effective

2831
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Being resistant to drugs is like resisting a dead pig

2832
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,500
I personally think this means

2833
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:28,500
The main antibacterial tires have a large drug resistance

2834
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:31,000
It has a stop model and a copped model

2835
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,500
That is, it will impress the membrane

2836
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:37,000
This is mainly if the drug resistance does not

2837
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,200
But antibacterial tires are still consistent

2838
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:44,500
DNA replication or RNA routing

2839
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:46,500
or as a transfer of blank paper

2840
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:51,000
This is very similar to the mechanism of action of most current antibiotics.

2841
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
If its mechanism of action is mainly limited to that part

2842
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Antimicrobial resistance may develop

2843
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,500
So it's two big

2844
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:05,720
Most of them are to destroy the membrane, in simple terms, to impress

2845
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:10,920
So cell disease bacteria, the cells inside the cells will be lost

2846
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:15,600
So the bacteria will be the first to meet, they won't be able to survive

2847
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:18,640
Second, the membrane is moved too much, it robsick

2848
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:24,440
So in EM, you can see that many cells have been ground by cells and are not brittle

2849
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:27,800
The cell chips come out, so these are two types

2850
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:31,560
It all depends on you, Kang Xintai, which one is the main mechanism of action?

2851
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:32,760
mostly impressed

2852
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:36,080
so this answers your question

2853
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:39,520
Well, the two times are about the same

2854
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:46,720
So now before it's over I'll announce that it's the next time

2855
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:49,360
grateful

2856
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,900
Director of Guoxing Lin Zuoyuan

2857
01:59:02,900 --> 01:59:07,820
The award is the memory of Japan in Taiwanese folk beliefs

2858
01:59:07,820 --> 01:59:10,820
I hope everyone will join in the night

2859
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:13,820
sure there will be more than enough in this dinner

2860
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:16,320
then we introduce again

2861
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:20,320
Thank you again Dr. Chen for your wonderful association
