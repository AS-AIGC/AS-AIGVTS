00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,000
The speakers of our session will be

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,640
report EI ONS is the same as NZ Hi

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,480
The speaker of our session will be

9
00:00:59,480 --> 00:00:59,580
depth ty peugeot

10
00:00:59,580 --> 00:00:59,980
This

11
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,680
Senator

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,600
Colleagues in the hospital and our friends from Academia Sinica

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,100
good night everyone

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,700
I am very glad that you all come to our Academia Sinica today

15
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,300
Feast of knowledge in November this year

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:18,100
We all enjoyed a very sumptuous dinner just now

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,900
But apart from this bodily feast

18
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,500
More importantly, we have a feast of knowledge

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,400
So we are very happy that you can come to participate today

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,200
Let's try, psychologically and intellectually

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,900
Both can improve, both can increase our own nutrition

22
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,400
Let me briefly introduce our speaker today

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,000
Today we are very happy to invite you to our Central Research Institute

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,600
Researcher and Deputy Director of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,300
Deputy director Shen Zhiliang came to tell us all

26
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,900
Health issues that everyone cares about

27
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,200
is to tailor your health

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,300
Personal Medicine in the 21st Century

29
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:00,400
We often say, oops, why would someone have two meetings earlier?

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,260
some people get this disease some people get that disease

31
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,380
Because everyone's illness is different

32
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,260
Then when SARS came

33
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,460
Some people get sick and some don't

34
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,060
So what is the reason?

35
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,960
What about our Chinese medicine?

36
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,000
called Chinese medicine

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,400
different personalities

38
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,700
Personal physique is different

39
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,140
Actually there is an important one

40
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,300
Just the genetics may be different

41
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,540
Are genetic diseases related to human diseases?

42
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,660
what is the relationship

43
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,960
We are the deputy director of the province

44
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,860
He is at the Academia Sinica

45
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,200
the research done

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,860
They are all very unique insights in this regard.

47
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,400
He was in 1983 and 1987

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,260
from the National Taiwan University of Public Health

49
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,520
After graduating from departments and graduate schools

50
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,920
Go to North Carolina in the United States to train a doctor

51
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,060
So back after the Ph.D.

52
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,520
has been in our Central Research Institute

53
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,660
Research Fellow at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences

54
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,620
His research is quite outstanding

55
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,060
so what

56
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,960
he has been all the way

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,380
Both left molecular and genetic epidemiology

58
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,500
He is an internationally renowned scholar

59
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,580
Let me give you an example like the research on breast cancer that I will talk about later.

60
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,740
In addition to doing a good job with domestic breast cancer research

61
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,580
We also participate in international cooperation projects

62
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,040
is the first global team

63
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,580
To perform a full gene scan on the genes of breast cancer patients

64
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,420
To find the gene for this heterosensitivity

65
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,080
He will share with you today

66
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,220
Then we all often take medicine and say

67
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,500
Oops, this A.R.M.A. eats watermelon Huan Jane

68
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,200
That means we often take medicine

69
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,600
Sometimes there are side effects and some people don't

70
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,900
What are the side effects of this drug?

71
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,300
what genes are affected

72
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,700
Here's the research their team did

73
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,080
this research is very important

74
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,580
Admire the best clinical research in the world

75
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,820
Beyond New Eagle Liver Medicine

76
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,280
It is important that the results of this study

77
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,420
Also makes the US Drug Inspection Bureau say

78
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,320
When you want to take a certain medicine in the future

79
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,060
which gene to test

80
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,060
have this genotype

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,020
it can't be like this

82
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,020
because of serious side effects

83
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,720
It has made a great contribution to the care of mankind.

84
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,100
So we are very happy to invite the priest and director today

85
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,960
Come give us a talk like this

86
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,000
Let me tell you a little secret

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,660
Father and Director, besides doing a good job in research

88
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,420
he is internationally renowned

89
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,620
He is also the winner of many domestic academic awards

90
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,020
He is the recipient of the National Science Council's Relief Award.

91
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,020
Then in mid-December when he

92
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,020
I want to take this from Wang Mingning

93
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,020
Outstanding Research Contribution Award

94
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,020
That is the highest award in the civil state of Washington, second only to the President's Award

95
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,020
so we welcome him to speak to us

96
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,020
Congratulations to his award

97
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,020
OK

98
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,020
Thank you Father Dean for your introduction

99
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,020
I am very happy that today our good friends inside and outside the courtyard

100
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,020
tonight

101
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,020
I hope to be able to give everyone a

102
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,020
What the priest and dean said just now

103
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,020
A rewarding evening in every way

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,820
Then I'll give you a very simple start

105
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,600
Because it is now 100 years since the founding of the country

106
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,140
There is a national movement in this place

107
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,220
Among them, the State Council of the Forbidden City has the so-called wonderful 100

108
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,260
There is the National Security Agency

109
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,800
that was a few days ago

110
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,620
I went with my father-in-law and mother-in-law to see the national security guards in the Forbidden City

111
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,440
One of the interesting words is

112
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,240
One from the Southern Song Dynasty is called Jia Sigu

113
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,020
painter

114
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,840
He drew a painting called Yanguan Ancient Temple

115
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,680
Then this ancient temple of Yanguan is known to many people in China better than me

116
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,280
Our Chinese landscape painting is a very important boutique

117
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,080
He painted that pine

118
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,400
On that rugged mountain

119
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,960
This temple is very famous

120
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,040
Look at the lower left corner in Jasko

121
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,580
Jascu also put himself

122
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
leave your name on it

123
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,920
Well, of course I don't have an artistic flair.

124
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,460
I love this painting

125
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,740
really make me

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,540
most interested in

127
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,840
These two things in the lower right corner

128
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,100
it looks like you zoomed in on it

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,240
like the guy in the transformers

130
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
And think what is this

131
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Then someone told me

132
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,740
Ah, this thing, that is

133
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,440
Judgment of Yang Ling's only breath is too bad

134
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,000
What are you actually?

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Just look at the Qingming River Scene

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,340
right there

137
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,500
Our most original Song Dynasty Zhang Zheduan's Qingming Riverside Picture

138
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,700
Qingming Shanghe map has

139
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,600
The part with the bridge and the part with the river

140
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,400
and that part of the street

141
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,100
on this street

142
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,200
Hey there is a person

143
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,500
you magnify it

144
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,100
What is that, ancient stranger?

145
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,800
So it turns out that Gu Sigu painted this thing just now.

146
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,200
It's a stranger, it's just used oblique

147
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,700
That abstract method draws it

148
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,900
It's a person with this thing on it

149
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,000
so it looks like a transformer

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,500
That's why Justin draws it more clearly

151
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,700
It's the one in the Qingming River Scene

152
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,500
In ancient times, in my current words, monks

153
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,100
the monk of course

154
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,400
make it more

155
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,600
see that clearly

156
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,500
Hezang in Tang Dynasty and Song Dynasty

157
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,800
Of course the most famous monk is Tang Sanzang

158
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,000
take seven days

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Tangshan Tibet in Dunhuang Dihua

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He also brought one like the one at that time

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's the same. He bid farewell to the Tang Dynasty emperor and said

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm going to the West to learn Buddhist scriptures

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
so be yourself

164
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
what does this have to do with us tonight

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
relevance

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I thought of one thing with this

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That is to say, we all have a Buddha

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That buddhist friend wants to say

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Buddhism teaches that all beings should be equal

170
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
so can't kill

171
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So Buddhism cannot eat that animal

172
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But in fact the habit of being a vegetarian in Buddhism

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
In fact, from the Tang Dynasty

174
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Because from the past, although Buddhism can say

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
try not to kill

176
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But it's really going to be the time of the two and five emperors

177
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's why we in Buddhism can't kill

178
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
As long as the Tang Dynasty

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Buddhist vegetarianism has only begun to become a

180
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Now everyone agrees that the one on the Niguel River

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Can't just eat vegetables

182
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,120
Can't be vegetarian

183
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,160
Then this thing is important to our medicine

184
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,600
A big influence is

185
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,360
Vegetarian thing

186
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,460
Thinking about it now is a healthy thing

187
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,960
why is it healthy

188
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,100
Then let’s talk about the Vice President Chen’s speech just now.

189
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,760
Specialized in my laboratory research

190
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,360
breast cancer in girls

191
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,000
Was there any breast cancer in the Tang and Han Dynasties?

192
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,800
Yes, I have

193
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,520
In the Song Dynasty there was one of the oldest

194
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,860
The Treasures of Chinese Surgery

195
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,320
It's called "Unrecorded Treasure Book"

196
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,660
in this book

197
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,860
In fact, in Chinese history

198
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,700
the word cancer

199
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,700
was in AD 1170

200
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,360
it really started to have the word cancer

201
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,160
that in this book

202
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,300
also began to point out a phenomenon

203
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,200
That phenomenon is our epidemiological

204
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,360
The golden rule that is often said nowadays

205
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,060
that is, breast cancer

206
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,360
The incidence of breast cancer in girls is 40 years old

207
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,360
You see this is the incidence of so-called common cancers

208
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,500
Female breast cancer after the age of 40

209
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,260
began to happen gradually

210
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,260
In this China's oldest

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,820
It is mentioned in ancient surgical books that

212
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,160
Girls' breast cancer will start to climb gradually after the age of 30 or 40

213
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,960
And it took about three years to become ill

214
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,500
then i put

215
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,300
just said

216
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,340
Buddhism says to be vegetarian

217
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,880
breast cancer

218
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,640
get together

219
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,440
It is one of our medical

220
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,240
What is often seldom observed before is the

221
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,020
nun

222
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,580
Nun because he is in Buddhism

223
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,600
he doesn't eat meat

224
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,400
so he is vegetarian

225
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,700
But this vegetarian

226
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,500
that is to say girls

227
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,540
Don't nuns get married and don't have children?

228
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,080
Usually wait and see

229
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,920
Girls who don't have children are more likely to get breast cancer

230
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,960
But Nun Nico

231
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,240
he does not have children

232
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,860
But his chance of getting breast cancer is much lower than the average person

233
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,900
so everyone wants

234
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,180
Nuns and ordinary girls

235
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,020
The biggest difference between a nun and ordinary girls is that he does not eat meat

236
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,040
therefore

237
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,140
Being vegetarian can prevent girls from getting breast cancer

238
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,100
rare

239
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Everyone had this idea before

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Then we put our observations

241
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
From the Tang Dynasty to the Song Dynasty

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Get our Taiwan today

243
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This is our girl from Taiwan

244
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
incidence of common cancers

245
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
you can find

246
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Uterine Well Cancer Because of Lifestyle Habits

247
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Improvement in Hygiene Habits

248
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Uterine well cancer is getting lower and lower

249
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But breast cancer is increasing

250
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Breast cancer is now a common cause of girls in Taiwan

251
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Ranked by incidence

252
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
cancer number one

253
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
is a very important

254
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
public health issues

255
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Therefore standing on a medical

256
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
researchers would like to say

257
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
why is it getting higher and higher

258
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
In fact the answer

259
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Since then on the Niguel

260
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
already told us

261
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Let's see again because of breast cancer

262
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
a structure of our breasts

263
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The structure of our breasts

264
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
like our lungs

265
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
like big trees

266
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
big trees with big limbs

267
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
is the structure of milk ducts

268
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What is breast cancer in the structure of milk ducts

269
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,840
Breast cancer refers to the structure of these milk ducts

270
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,040
A certain cell starts from one to two and two to four

271
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
until the end of the milk duct is full

272
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,480
run out at the end

273
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,680
You use that histology section to say

274
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,440
Suppose a breast cancer patient you cut a piece of cancer tissue

275
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,200
You can see that the normal milk duct is everyone

276
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,240
Below you can see that this is very similar to a pipe-by-pipe situation

277
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,840
Let's talk about cancer cells starting to grow randomly

278
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,240
always long long long

279
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,840
Fill the whole breast cancer

280
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,680
We call it original cancer

281
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,280
It looks like you see here on the right

282
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,640
It's the whole thing full of you see

283
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,520
Originally, the milk ducts were empty because of the absence of milk

284
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,120
But primary cancer is to fill up the entire milk duct

285
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,600
Once penetrated, it becomes a cancer cell

286
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,000
running around

287
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,400
This is breast cancer as we know it

288
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,240
Through our awareness of breast cancer

289
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,840
We explain why breast cancer is on the rise

290
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,080
Because one of the leading causes of breast cancer

291
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,640
female hormone

292
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,240
It's a chemical mask like this

293
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,320
because it's simple

294
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,240
boys and girls

295
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,440
The difference between girls is that boys are almost free from breast cancer

296
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,440
Girls are prone to breast cancer

297
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,940
Where is the difference between boys and girls

298
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,040
boys do not menstruate

299
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,100
Girls have menstruation

300
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,940
when girls menstruate

301
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,140
In our warm tide will produce this female hormone

302
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,540
What is the main function of female hormones

303
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,340
We have female hormones to thank

304
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,340
Because female hormones go to our breast cells

305
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,740
Estrogen travels to the cells of our uterus

306
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,400
will make one cell become two

307
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,440
two to four

308
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
where is the purpose

309
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,180
The purpose is to replace the fetus that may come

310
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,680
build a house first

311
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
you want

312
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,980
The fetus is about to implant in the womb

313
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,180
Then of course we have to build a home for him first.

314
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,880
So the role of the hormone itself is

315
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,980
sudden death breast cells

316
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,780
sudden death endometrial cell proliferation

317
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,280
to give a girl a chance to meet

318
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,480
coming baby

319
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,140
But this situation

320
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,080
Know the cancer cells

321
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,620
what do we say cancer cells

322
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,080
cancer cell

323
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I just mentioned this situation

324
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
so would have been a good thing

325
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Hypothetically for cancer cells to take advantage of

326
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
A normal cell

327
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Assuming that after giving it to cancer cells to steal it

328
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Cancer cells say I will use it

329
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
This hormone prompts the cells

330
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
This property of proliferation

331
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
that can easily lead to breast cancer

332
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
because girls have this

333
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So girls get breast cancer

334
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
boys don't have this

335
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Boys don't get breast cancer

336
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Then you say that this air belt causes breast cancer

337
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What does it matter if you get higher and higher

338
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's the clue the nun told us

339
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
because where does hermon come from

340
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The source of hormone is from our cholesterol

341
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
where does cholesterol come from

342
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Cholesterol is in western food

343
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
high fat content

344
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So Nidi gradually became smaller

345
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Why now breast cancer is getting higher and higher

346
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
or you said just now

347
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Why nuns are less likely to get breast cancer

348
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Because the nun is vegetarian?

349
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
vegetarian results

350
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,800
leading to their lower fat intake

351
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,200
lower fat intake

352
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,240
low cholesterol

353
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
low cholesterol

354
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
less hormones

355
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
less hormones

356
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
Cells are less likely to grow randomly

357
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,540
So of course nuns don't get breast cancer

358
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,540
the same reason

359
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,340
So why is breast cancer more and more common now?

360
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,340
we joke

361
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,540
Because now

362
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,540
Everyone grew up eating McDonald's

363
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,740
Traditional oriental food has less fat

364
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,240
Western food is more fatty

365
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,740
Now everyone pays

366
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,740
eat that eat western food

367
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,240
under the influence of western food

368
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,740
Of course the fat is higher

369
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,740
high cholesterol

370
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,740
Of course, the cell proliferation is faster

371
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,740
Therefore, the chances of getting breast cancer will increase

372
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,740
So we know without looking at this

373
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,740
we often read newspapers

374
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,740
middle school lady

375
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,740
Primary school has not yet graduated

376
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,740
started puberty

377
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,740
That's because everyone is eating western food now

378
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,740
Relatively speaking

379
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,740
breast development

380
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,740
development of the uterine lining

381
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,740
like our grandmothers

382
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,740
was much taller at that time

383
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,740
that plus

384
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,560
Just mentioned that hormones will promote cell proliferation

385
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,120
Of course he is now causing breast cancer to be higher and higher

386
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,460
In addition to the effect of this muscle cell food

387
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,500
There is another reason

388
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,100
It is a law of economics and education that we teach medical students

389
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,640
What is the law of economics and education?

390
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,960
That is to say, a cell in our body

391
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,260
is a cell

392
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,060
midlife in terms of cells

393
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,860
he only does three things

394
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,160
The first thing is called the opposite

395
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,440
assassination of cells

396
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,980
What is cell assassination? That is

397
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,280
normal cells when found

398
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,820
when the environment doesn't need it

399
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,140
It will show a high degree of sentiment and say that it is better to die

400
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,180
like what?

401
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,480
like our thymocytes

402
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,280
We grew up with a thymus as a child without a thymus

403
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,320
Why?

404
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,900
Thymocytes are the source of immune cells

405
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,220
Normally, our immune cells come from the bone marrow

406
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,780
But when we were just born

407
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,580
Incomplete bone marrow development

408
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,920
When we were young, we depended on thymocytes

409
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
produce immune cells

410
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,900
But when we grow up

411
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,500
After the bone marrow is fully developed

412
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,900
Thymocyte Discovery Says It Doesn't Need It

413
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,840
I used a high degree of love to say that I am dead

414
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,340
So this is a phenomenon of a normal cell

415
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,100
First

416
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,540
Cells say a second thing besides the first

417
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,000
That is to say, it is called cell division

418
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,400
like we grow up in adolescence

419
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,900
One bone cell becomes two

420
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,700
Only when two become four can we grow taller

421
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,700
So the second thing is called cell proliferation

422
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,200
what are cancer cells

423
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,900
A cancer cell is a cell

424
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,100
replicative proliferation too divisive

425
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
we just said

426
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,300
The hormone itself will suddenly kill the excessive cell proliferation

427
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,400
So we just said

428
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,500
Hormones are what cause, for example

429
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,000
too much fat in the diet

430
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,800
lead to more hormonal exposure

431
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,400
So the chances of Drew coming are higher.

432
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Drew's coming also has something to do with the third thing

433
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,400
In addition to death, suicide and proliferation of cells

434
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,380
The third thing is called

435
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,600
What is differentiation? A cell does what it is supposed to do

436
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,140
is called differentiation

437
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,000
So we joke about cell division versus cell differentiation

438
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,560
A cell will only choose one thing to do again

439
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,160
It means that as far as cells are concerned, there is no further study.

440
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,960
That is to say, studying at school is studying at school

441
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,800
Play a specific role in social work

442
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,900
He can't do two things together

443
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,740
So a very important concept is what is called cell differentiation

444
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,500
Cell differentiation means that a cell does what it is supposed to do

445
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,460
So a very important concept arises

446
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,700
Since three things or two things will only choose one thing to do

447
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,100
Thus differentiated cells do not divide

448
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,420
Cells that divide do not differentiate

449
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:57,760
That is, assuming a breast cell does what it's supposed to do,

450
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,080
less likely to get breast cancer

451
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,840
I just thought, what are breast cells supposed to do?

452
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,640
Breast cells are supposed to produce breast milk

453
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,220
So everyone thinks that the answer to the mystery will be revealed gradually.

454
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,300
What kind of opportunity would make a girl

455
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,340
breast cells that produce breast milk

456
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,880
Pregnant and have a baby

457
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,220
Therefore, pregnancy and childbirth is to protect a girl

458
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,560
A very important factor in preventing breast cancer

459
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,360
So put it together, the mystery is gradually revealed

460
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,420
So why are we getting more and more breast cancer now?

461
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,520
On the one hand, Cellfood has more fat and more cholesterol

462
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,320
Hormones are high, cell proliferation and division are more

463
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,400
Of course, it is getting higher and higher. Two aspects, changes in pregnancy behavior

464
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,980
Why don't you get married now, get married late, don't have children, have children late

465
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,060
The number of children is small, and there is no time to replenish milk after giving birth

466
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,620
If this natural protective factor is used less and less

467
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,700
Of course, she has more chances of splitting

468
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,000
Of course, the incidence rate of cancer is relatively high.

469
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,600
Therefore, these two reasons fully explain breast cancer

470
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,620
happening higher and higher

471
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,780
A long time ago, three or four years ago, with the Tri-Service General Hospital

472
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,940
Vice President Yu Zhicheng said in our cooperation

473
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,840
Since the risk factor you just mentioned

474
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,240
What is early?

475
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,800
Not pregnant or the first birth is late

476
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,340
or have no breastfeeding experience

477
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,180
These factors are really so important

478
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,240
then let's find

479
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,080
Come to find girls in Taiwan after all

480
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,040
Each of these three risk factors

481
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,780
Doubling the risk of breast cancer

482
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,120
So 759 patients were recruited at Tri-Service General Hospital

483
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,920
Of course it's not just about seeing patients.

484
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,520
A total of 1,200 healthy girls were found

485
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,380
that than what

486
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,620
It's easier than this, one, two, three, what is it?

487
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,960
These patients are no different from healthy people

488
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,760
One is bad, two is bad or three is bad

489
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,320
Do the statistics and find that

490
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,420
Breast cancer in Taiwan is indeed related to these three traditional factors

491
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,820
Hormonal factors are highly correlated with pregnancy factors

492
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,900
Because sick people compare with healthy people

493
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,020
Each additional

494
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,600
1.4 to 3 times more likely to develop breast cancer

495
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,160
With this conclusion, we were itching to be healed at the time.

496
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,000
As a result, Dr. Yu told his patients

497
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,360
As a result, immediately filled with frustration, immediately choked by his patient

498
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,740
Why do we compare patients to controls—comparing

499
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,600
Indeed, patients are more likely than controls to have risk factors

500
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,640
But why is it choked up?

501
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,960
look at the patient carefully

502
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,560
On the one hand, we acknowledge that these risk factors are important

503
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,620
But you really see patients

504
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,960
There are also as high as nearly 40%

505
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,240
What about 39% of patients?

506
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,560
Not a single risk factor

507
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,140
The representative said, are these factors important? Of course they are

508
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,680
But these factors

509
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,000
There is no way to explain all that happens in breast cancer

510
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,820
In fact, this matter is often found abroad

511
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,600
For example, let me show you

512
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,880
A recent study

513
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,160
was made in Europe

514
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,240
One of the things he does is called dietary intervention.

515
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,340
Because we just said that aunts don't get breast cancer

516
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,000
So in the European study here

517
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
A total of 4690 girls were found

518
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The regulations say that you are 2349 people in the control group

519
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
2340 people said that eating meat is not good

520
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
start eating vegetarian

521
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Therefore, there are 2,340 vegetarians and 2,300 in the control group

522
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Observed 16 years to see their lives

523
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
let's see

524
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
For the control group it happened like this

525
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Of course, the longer you track, the easier it is to get breast cancer

526
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
it's useless

527
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
our main concern is

528
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What happens to the intervention group equal to the bland food group?

529
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
what's on our mind

530
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Eating bland food should have no fat

531
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's hard to get breast cancer

532
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But everyone found

533
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
come and see

534
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I just found out a few months ago

535
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
published results

536
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
it turns out

537
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
look at their reality

538
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,400
The blue ones are on top of the yellow ones in terms of statistics

539
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,800
16 years of being a nigga doesn't do any good

540
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Relatively speaking, there is a 1.19 times more chance of breastfeeding than the creator

541
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,000
In fact, this conclusion is not surprising at all.

542
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,200
This conclusion was called overweight during the most famous medical period in the United States in 2006

543
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,900
There has been a larger study

544
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,500
Harvard University

545
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,100
It tracked 200,000 of that so-called nurse

546
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,800
Because nurses are very supportive of medical research

547
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,900
Therefore, in the tracking of this 8

548
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,800
200,000 nurses tracked over 8 years

549
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,700
We look at the incidence of common cancers

550
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,000
and the incidence of chronic diseases we're talking about

551
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,300
The first is breast cancer

552
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,500
The black ones refer to the bland food group

553
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,100
The gray one is generally we joke that it is bigger than the big meat group

554
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,500
This is what everyone sees

555
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,200
Although the bland food group was slightly

556
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
would for the first point

557
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,160
But doing statistical analysis brings congratulations

558
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,380
What is drawn is superscript and subscript

559
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,500
Considering from the result of superscript

560
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,780
In fact, there is not much difference between the two

561
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,440
Been a nun for eight years

562
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,780
In fact, the prevention of breast cancer

563
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,340
don't contribute at all

564
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,740
According to this foreign study

565
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,180
Let's look at Chinese studies

566
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,200
is my good friend

567
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,940
That Professor Zheng is there

568
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,740
The so-called famous Shanghai

569
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,940
Breast Cancer Study

570
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,980
breast cancer research

571
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,580
He is in the Shanghai area

572
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,220
Followed nearly a thousand girls

573
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,720
and then depending on their diet

574
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,980
For example, you see

575
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,060
One, two, three, four is the group of vegetarians

576
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,980
Instead, he is divided into a little element

577
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,060
a little more vegetarian

578
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,780
To the last fourth is to be completely vegetarian

579
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,820
One, two, three, four should be lighter

580
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,520
But look at the incidence of breast cancer

581
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,920
If the first group is regarded as one

582
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,220
one point zero one point zero one point zero one point zero

583
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:53,860
how is it

584
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,980
no help

585
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,380
Hence this result

586
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,020
just tell us a frustrating

587
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
That is to say, the occurrence of Hollanda is of course closely related to breast cancer.

588
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
But how much breast cancer does it explain?

589
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
looks very limited

590
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
That girl is crazy

591
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Said that you didn't seem to have any risk factors before

592
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
In terms of public health

593
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
take extreme precautions

594
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It seems that it is not easy to have a good effect

595
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
The public health scientist is like the deputy dean

596
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
He said we started doing stimulus prevention

597
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
how to stimulate prevention

598
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Early detection and early treatment

599
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Therefore breast cancer

600
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Girls aged four to five now in the Department of Health

601
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
every two years or three years

602
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The government health insurance supplements the payment once

603
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
so-called mammography

604
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Because you said that the food is actually bland

605
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
that doesn't do much good

606
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Then we have no choice but to retreat to the second line

607
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
with early detection by mammography

608
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
for early detection of breast cancer

609
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Then of course do mammography

610
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
psychology itself

611
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,640
That's very brave, I want to say I'm going to surgery

612
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,600
It's troublesome to line up with others

613
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,000
And that good friend who had a mammogram must know

614
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,700
It's very, very painful.

615
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,880
Girls can't stand it

616
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,840
but no way

617
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,300
Striking the bathroom does not work

618
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,740
Then we start early detection

619
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,680
That benefits Taiwan's advanced medical standards

620
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,140
The one who did the mammography has a lot of doctors who are very good

621
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,180
The main thing in mammography is to catch a little

622
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,840
the so-called capping point

623
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,180
That is to say, there's still obvious finesse here.

624
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:34,780
That is to say, some girls will see a little bit in the middle of the breast

625
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,540
Gaihua dots like grains of rice

626
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,440
For example, the cover point is obvious

627
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,740
or is it

628
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,580
I saw that the so-called Department of Histology was seen on the right hand side

629
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,640
Just now this is a normal breast duct.

630
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,680
as we just saw

631
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,740
So the assumption is that the milk ducts are starting to proliferate a little bit normally.

632
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,480
There are more and more cells like this

633
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,840
Another less favorable situation is called

634
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,280
Abnormal hyperplasia is called ADH

635
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,480
The difference between here and here is that there are more cells

636
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,180
therefore

637
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,600
Therefore by mammography

638
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Hoping to find a cover point

639
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,900
and the circumstances in which this ADH is found

640
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,600
Because I hope to catch it earlier

641
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,100
Abnormal proliferation of cells

642
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,700
If you find a capillary point or an abnormal growth

643
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,400
It may mean that the breast cells have begun to grow randomly

644
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,400
So the surgeons say it's not good

645
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,200
You should take that cell out and cut it off

646
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,800
Wow that girl was struggling

647
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,200
Going to that or that official surgery for him to have an operation

648
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,800
it hurts him to pull in

649
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,000
I want that wound

650
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,200
And that two or three months can not touch the water

651
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,400
And that smoked a piece of meat

652
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,700
Pull it in and take it out sometimes the breasts will deform

653
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,500
So it's a simple outpatient procedure

654
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,000
So there is no way

655
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,500
That person talks about that and that Gaihua point

656
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:54,300
Or that ADH is a precursor to bisexual breast cells

657
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,500
Therefore, because the screening tools in Taiwan are very developed now

658
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,200
So there are a lot of cover points and ADH

659
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,120
was found that a lot of that that

660
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,720
women would worry

661
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,620
Am I a malignant breast cell?

662
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,000
But really you ask an oncologist

663
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,720
you ask a surgeon

664
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,000
What are the chances of this changing here?

665
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,320
40 so only 15%

666
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,000
That is to say

667
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,120
85% of girls get white cancer after that injection

668
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,720
It's all pain, it's all white pain

669
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,320
Because most of the generalized points

670
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,800
ADH

671
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,120
It's all benign and it doesn't matter.

672
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,920
So it's hard to retreat to the second line

673
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,520
We hope to find an earlier discovery

674
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,120
Indicators of breast cancer such as mammography

675
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,600
But it seems that the result is also

676
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,720
85% of that and that's irritation prevention is for nothing

677
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,720
So from what you said just now that dietary intervention

678
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,920
eat bland food

679
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,520
Or back off to the second line for mammography

680
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,120
Tell us about the spirit mentioned by Dean Zeng Wu just now

681
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,120
tell us about the risk factors

682
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,340
Very important. These risk factors include light

683
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,240
That diet eats too much oil

684
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,540
What Covered Points Are Included

685
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,940
these things are important

686
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,280
But these things can't be explained

687
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,840
all disease occurrences

688
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,180
Even a large proportion of breast cancers occur

689
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,680
There is no way to explain it by these traditional factors

690
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,780
what to do

691
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,380
so keep going

692
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,380
Not just male breast cancer, but female breast cancer

693
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,880
Let's look at breast cancer in boys

694
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,620
Liver cancer ranks first among male breast cancers

695
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,120
The incidence of liver cancer is gradually decreasing

696
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,420
Why is the incidence of liver cancer gradually decreasing now?

697
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,020
Thanks to the famous Professor Bisley

698
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,420
in 1981

699
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,160
He followed a group of more than 20,000 people from Taiwan

700
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,360
turn out

701
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,060
b Incidence of liver cancer in the generation of the liver

702
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,160
During this 15-year track

703
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,060
Not more than 200 times that of forced liver

704
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,040
Liver Generation

705
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,060
relationship with liver cancer

706
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
In fact, there is another important discovery

707
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It is discovered that this liver B can be vertically transmitted

708
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Can be passed from mother to child

709
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Therefore, we can predict that the incidence of liver cancer will gradually decrease after vaccination

710
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
But why is it still so high?

711
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
At that time, it is worth mentioning a recent study by our Vice President Chen

712
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Except liver B

713
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
What is another important risk factor for liver cancer?

714
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Hepatitis C

715
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Hepatitis virus A, B, C, D keeps going

716
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Beyond Hepatitis B

717
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
following a hepatitis C virus

718
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's just a very important event.

719
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
This is a great student of Vice President Chen

720
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Dr. Mi Hyun Lee

721
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
A study published in the world's most prestigious cancer journal last year

722
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It’s long-term tracking, how much tracking, and ten years of tracking to see what to say

723
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Hepatitis C very high Hepatitis C very low

724
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Hepatitis C undetectable or no hepatitis C at all

725
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
divide it into four groups

726
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
you did find

727
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,200
Ten years ago, the group with the highest Qixing Qiannian

728
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,500
Indeed, compared with the following three groups

729
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:10,700
Ten years after Ganya, the occurrence rate of Ganya is much higher

730
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,100
no doubt

731
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,900
tell us again

732
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,900
Infection in Qixing Qiannian is Taiwan

733
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,300
Ganya is a very important factor

734
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,700
But let's look at this picture again

735
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,100
the same story happened again

736
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,100
you said very high

737
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,500
is relative to 14.71, relative to 6.4, relative to 1.1

738
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,300
High compared to 0.4

739
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,100
but on the other hand

740
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,500
Let's say I'm the Great Plainsman of Xigan

741
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,300
I'm afraid to say it when I see this

742
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,500
This assumption I am very high

743
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,700
then i'm scared

744
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,500
Will you get Gan Ya after ten years?

745
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
But everyone see

746
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,100
14.1 will also get Gan Ya

747
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,100
what the representative said

748
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:51,500
85% of the high Xigan Dayuan people after ten years

749
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,800
Still won't get Gan Ya

750
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,700
what are you afraid of

751
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,900
Most Xigan people will not get Ganya

752
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,900
what are you afraid of

753
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,500
So the story just now came again

754
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,500
Can Xi Gan do it?

755
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
of course do not do

756
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,660
But can he explain

757
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,000
All of the Peerless Diseases

758
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
can't

759
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And peerless

760
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Most people with western liver disease will not get liver cancer

761
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,500
Just now the story happened again

762
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,000
What about the diet?

763
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
these things are not important

764
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
let's do that

765
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
put these things don't smoke

766
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Don't drink, don't be sick wolf

767
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Then you say smoking is good?

768
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,500
Of course smoking is bad

769
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,000
Smoking is four times more likely to get lung cancer than non-smoking

770
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Among those 100 lung cancer patients

771
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
There are 80 smokers

772
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
so smoking is bad

773
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
That's why that Sister Sun Yue asked us to say

774
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Ah, don't smoke

775
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
But you ask people to quit smoking

776
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
what people think

777
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Guess everyone

778
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
100 smokers

779
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
In the end, how many people got liver cancer?

780
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
In fact only how much

781
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
15

782
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
That is to say

783
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You tell people to quit smoking

784
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Why don't people quit smoking

785
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Because 85% of people who smoke will not get liver cancer

786
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's the same story as before

787
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Therefore these things

788
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
fully tell everything

789
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
occurrence of disease

790
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Although

791
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,440
risk factors matter

792
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,400
But these risk factors seem to explain only a fraction of the disease

793
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,600
It's not just the disease that happens

794
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,340
It's not just cancer

795
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,340
The same goes for other chronic diseases.

796
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,940
Here you can see that it is the diabetes we are talking about.

797
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,300
what is diabetes about

798
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,440
The doctor must have told his patient

799
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,640
Ah, your medicine doesn't work

800
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,680
what is the best medicine

801
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,740
lose weight first

802
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,600
because

803
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,240
Everyone, what you have seen

804
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,200
What about the horizontal axis?

805
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,800
is what we call the obesity index

806
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,280
square your weight

807
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,200
What about the heavy shaft?

808
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,600
It is the percentage of occurrence of diabetes

809
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,540
what about blue

810
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,000
a diabetic patient

811
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
what about white

812
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,100
just normal

813
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,700
so-called non-diabetic people

814
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,400
Then just say it

815
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,300
blue is to the right of white

816
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,900
It's the blue diabetic patient

817
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,400
his body mass index

818
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,200
Distribution of the obesity index

819
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,000
fatter than average

820
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,100
So this is what doctors often say

821
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,500
The best medicine is to lose weight first

822
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,000
But now medicine is definitely not saying this

823
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,740
unimportant

824
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,240
what medicine sees now

825
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,500
the following

826
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,340
you see blue people

827
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,440
Some people are also below BMI22.5

828
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,740
that's light

829
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,500
Why Not Everyone With Diabetes

830
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,040
overweight

831
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,340
the same reason

832
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,380
to ask someone to lose weight

833
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,580
Why do people want to lose weight?

834
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,780
there are a lot of people

835
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,340
you see white

836
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,740
There are a lot of people whose BMI is above 30 or 35

837
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,340
But not all overweight people

838
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,300
will get diabetes

839
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,700
The story just came again

840
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,040
occurrence of disease

841
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,840
occurrence of lung cancer

842
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,500
occurrence of breast cancer

843
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,100
occurrence of liver cancer

844
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,000
occurrence of diabetes

845
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,240
Tradition matters

846
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,400
But these factors

847
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,100
Cannot explain all disease occurrences

848
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,900
let's take a step back

849
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,200
disease treatment

850
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
For example, for a girl

851
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,900
she started saying

852
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,000
will i get

853
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
why do you get

854
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,200
These things were mentioned to you just now

855
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,340
what to do after you get it

856
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,200
how to treat

857
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,000
what method to use to be effective

858
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,400
Also faced the same problem just now

859
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,700
for example

860
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,600
in terms of breast cancer

861
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,000
Because this is what I know best

862
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
among breast cancer

863
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,700
I just talked about Hormon himself

864
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,700
Hormon itself can promote cell proliferation

865
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,700
Promoting cell proliferation leads to cancer

866
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,700
How does the hormone promote cell proliferation

867
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,500
It is He Meng, the green part that everyone sees

868
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,500
There is a hormone receptor on the surface of our Wufang cells

869
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,000
two connected together

870
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,100
Hormonal receptors are like a medicine stone hole

871
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,600
Hormon is like a medicine stone

872
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,000
Once opened, the cells start to grow randomly

873
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,400
So there is a medicine

874
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,600
That medicine is a very good medicine

875
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,300
It's called Tamasifen

876
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,000
It can treat a patient with female cancer

877
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,900
how it cures

878
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,500
Its treatment method is very simple and clear

879
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
it's the medicine

880
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,900
I will go with Hormon to grab the Hormon acceptor

881
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,600
Assuming this receptor is taken away by drug

882
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,900
This He Meng will not follow this

883
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,500
This acceptor is connected

884
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,100
so the cells do not proliferate

885
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,400
So here is one way

886
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,000
But what are the disadvantages of using Tamasifen

887
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,700
it's a cheap

888
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,600
medicine with few side effects

889
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,100
But it took two

890
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
After three years, the infection will become resistant

891
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Even some people start Tamasiva

892
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
it doesn't seem to work

893
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So that tumor can be said to be

894
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Don't worry, there's another pill now

895
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
It's called Lephtharol

896
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
This drug goes a different way

897
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
In this way, we call it the bird thief and the first bird king

898
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
how to say

899
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It is aimed at the girls after the poultry essence

900
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
After Lephtharol is special about what is poultry essence

901
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's just that warm tides don't produce hormones

902
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Warm tides do not produce hormones

903
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's not that we don't have hormones in our bodies

904
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Because we just said that hormones come from fat

905
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So the hormones before the poultry essence

906
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
will accumulate in our adipose tissue

907
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Once the poultry essence, these past accumulated

908
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
is released by an enzyme

909
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
That enzyme is called Aromatase

910
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
will put past poultry essence before

911
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
The accumulated hormones are affected by Aromatase

912
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
It will be converted into hormonal bird essence and then used

913
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That is the pharmacological mechanism of creating this medicine

914
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It is to give this converted enzyme to

915
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
block him

916
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,760
Of course that's what I just said

917
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,860
Qin thief pre-Qin king

918
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,460
After putting the whole Pingjin, the source of Horrer Horrer

919
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,660
After blocking

920
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,600
Of course the hormones are less

921
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,660
cells will not rot

922
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,800
Then of course the cancer can be controlled

923
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,160
Then you have to use Qin thief and Qin king's trick

924
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,260
Or use the trick of grabbing the position

925
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,960
According to our common sense

926
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,760
It should be more effective

927
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,960
Because it was blocked from the beginning

928
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,160
Because here is still going to grab

929
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,560
sometimes win sometimes lose

930
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,560
But here is the source of fundamental hormones

931
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
After blocking

932
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,860
Of course it's less likely to get breast cancer

933
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,520
real

934
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,760
Indeed, judging from the five-year clinical trials conducted in the United States

935
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,120
This is the incidence of breast cancer

936
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,960
after another year

937
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,960
In the Tamasibon group just now

938
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
just now

939
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,800
The one who grabbed the position in this group

940
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,860
The breast cancer recurrence rate is

941
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,660
That 13.6%

942
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,320
But the group of Qin bandits before the king of Qin is 10.3%

943
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,420
Indeed, the group of Qin bandits and pre-Qin kings is more effective

944
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,980
But you ask a patient and a surgeon

945
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
he just said

946
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Does train meat work?

947
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Of course it works

948
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
in October 2009

949
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
start health insurance

950
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
But train meat has a lot of sequelae

951
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
why

952
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
That's what a lot of older girls want

953
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
girls get sick

954
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
called menopause

955
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
how is it

956
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Hormones are a good thing.

957
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Hormones regulate body temperature

958
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Hormones prevent bone transport

959
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
so some girls

960
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
after her menopause

961
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Just after the warm tide stopped giving birth

962
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
after menopause

963
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
flushing throughout the day

964
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I feel that face is dirty all day long, as if I have a fever

965
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Then there will be bone transport

966
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Then you use an artificial way now

967
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Block this too

968
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
The source of the hormone is not

969
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Of course after menopause

970
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
It's serious

971
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So after the train meat is used

972
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
My good friend from Chang Gung Hospital

973
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Director Chen Xinshe said

974
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
what joint pain

975
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
bone transport

976
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Flushing

977
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Tired

978
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
headache side effects

979
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
will make many patients

980
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Can’t bear it, it’s just a serious stop and stop task group.

981
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,640
What to do then he said please bear with me

982
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,000
Unfortunately, Zeng Qingshe is a boy.

983
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,160
Didn't he know just now that you can't work, stop the task group?

984
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,280
what a pain

985
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,960
So the same reasoning comes

986
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,320
what about that girl

987
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,920
It's better to choose one

988
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,440
but more side effects

989
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,440
or choose a comparison

990
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,280
not so good

991
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,840
medicine with less side effects

992
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,360
This is also a problem

993
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,080
same treatment strategy

994
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,680
But every choice

995
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,840
It seems that there is no fixed answer

996
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,360
I just talked about TOMASKIN

997
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,360
It doesn't matter if the super meat is effective

998
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,120
some medicine

999
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,800
This is my exaggerated report in 2005

1000
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,880
That is, there is a doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital who said

1001
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,360
We have high cholesterol now

1002
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,320
But what?

1003
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,840
The so-called lipid-lowering drugs we take

1004
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,720
100% take basic medicine

1005
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,920
Everything you eat is free

1006
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,200
It's useless to eat everything

1007
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,320
Just now you said that the super meat is still effective.

1008
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,560
Some medicines have no effect at all

1009
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,360
That didn't work at all. It doesn't matter.

1010
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,800
what's more serious

1011
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,200
There will be drug damage

1012
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,120
Some medicines can also cause serious

1013
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,400
that allergic reaction

1014
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,760
Our Department of Health has a foundation

1015
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,440
It's called that medicine, that relief.

1016
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,320
the Drug Injury Relief Committee

1017
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,600
After counting

1018
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,920
8 From 1999 when he founded to 2011

1019
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,760
A total of 705 successfully appealed cases

1020
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,360
Among them, the first place is 305

1021
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,320
It's the famous Steven Johnson

1022
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,720
Stevenson Johnson

1023
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,800
It's a severe skin allergy.

1024
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,640
it's the skin like a burn

1025
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,280
The whole skin turns up like this

1026
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,640
The skin we are talking about has a normal protective function

1027
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,640
If you must turn it up

1028
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,720
It's easy to get infected

1029
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,640
The drug rash that covered the whole body

1030
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,720
So what medicine should I take

1031
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,960
Some medicines work and some medicines don't

1032
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,400
drugs that don't work sometimes

1033
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,280
can also cause severe allergic reactions

1034
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,360
what to do

1035
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,400
Therefore these things

1036
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,040
Now is the problem that medicine is facing now

1037
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,920
from the beginning we just said

1038
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,720
Can a nun get breast cancer?

1039
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,320
Tell us that privacy is important

1040
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,600
But privacy can't explain the whole of the decision.

1041
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,960
occurrence of disease

1042
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,320
disease progression

1043
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,520
disease treatment

1044
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,600
full of differences from person to person

1045
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,320
those factors are important

1046
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,320
However, these factors do not seem to be able to explain

1047
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,480
all diseases

1048
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,200
So we physicians say

1049
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,360
Then can we tailor-made

1050
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,040
like a tailor

1051
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,280
Of course we are now ours

1052
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,800
When you go shopping for clothes, there are

1053
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,760
small has medium, has s, has m, has l

1054
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,000
It's us who come to match the look of this dress

1055
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,840
that's that

1056
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,080
That rich man they don't go with everyone

1057
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,480
Which department store buys m or l

1058
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,080
he will ask a tailor to come to his house

1059
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,280
Tailored for him

1060
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,360
according to his figure

1061
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,160
Sin fits him and don't fit m and won't divide into l

1062
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,160
He only needs the medicine that suits his figure

1063
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,520
Thus the concept of personalized medicine was born

1064
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,360
That's what I just said

1065
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,720
that privacy is important

1066
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,080
But can't explain the disease

1067
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Is the overall progression of the disease critical?

1068
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,400
What kind of medicine to take? Will the treatment have any side effects?

1069
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,400
Then can we adapt to each person's different situation?

1070
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,300
Tailored for him

1071
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,400
The best strategy for the treatment of disease progression

1072
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,100
So that's what we're going to tell you tonight

1073
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,200
Personalized medicine is based on the individual

1074
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,900
disease prevention or treatment

1075
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,100
In other words, as far as it is concerned, it is called prescribing the right medicine

1076
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,900
Prescribe the right medicine, okay?

1077
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,200
Of course yes, for the same disease

1078
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,600
Giving the same medicine is what we have in mind

1079
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,800
In this medicine, the vast majority of people are effective

1080
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,500
But some people have no effect

1081
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,700
Some people even seriously hear the sound of death

1082
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,600
Well, personalized medicine is just like that.

1083
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,500
We want to be able to drug people

1084
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,700
It is equal to consider that people are different from each other

1085
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,800
Why are people different? Vice President Chen just said

1086
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,400
It's not the same as physique

1087
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,200
Some people are expensive to smoke

1088
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,900
Some people will not be expensive if they smoke for a lifetime

1089
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,740
Can each person's physical factors be considered first?

1090
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,380
Then, after taking physical factors into consideration

1091
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,440
decide later

1092
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,240
It is established that progression is the best strategy for treatment

1093
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,340
what is physique

1094
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,340
it's genetic

1095
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,340
It's where people are different

1096
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,640
Consider each person's genetic status

1097
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,840
to decide who should eat

1098
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,140
Who should take this medicine

1099
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,040
that medicine

1100
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,840
So this is the concept of so-called personalized medicine

1101
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,040
From prescribing the right medicine to prescribing people

1102
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,540
Treatment for disease progression

1103
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,240
make better predictions

1104
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,740
So you've all learned about genetics before

1105
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,340
We all know what a gene is

1106
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,840
Of course I'm the one here

1107
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,340
That class is doing a lot of work.

1108
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,340
what is gene

1109
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,440
Genes are in our body

1110
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,640
The ruler of any life center

1111
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,740
inside our body

1112
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,840
Let's look at the following

1113
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,740
inside our body

1114
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,840
inside everyone's body

1115
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,840
It is composed of individual cells

1116
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,240
The composition of everyone is the same

1117
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,640
So our body is like a house

1118
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,640
our house

1119
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,740
is a maximum of ten trillion cells in a house

1120
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Every cell is constantly being renewed

1121
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
What is the master in the cell?

1122
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
inside each of our cells

1123
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
where a commander in chief lives

1124
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
the president's house

1125
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
That place is called the cell box

1126
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
you take out the cell box

1127
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
It's what we learned in middle school biology

1128
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
are called chromosomes

1129
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
What are chromosomes?

1130
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
we used to carry

1131
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
We humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes

1132
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
every cell is the same

1133
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Of the 23 pairs of chromosomes

1134
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
half from dad

1135
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
half from mom

1136
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Chromosomes are like balls of yarn

1137
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Once you pull the yarn inside the yarn ball

1138
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
That's what high school students learn now

1139
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's what we call genes

1140
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
That's what we call DNA

1141
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
why

1142
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
In our 23 pairs of chromosomes

1143
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It is among the 46 balls of yarn

1144
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
There are 30,000 genes in total

1145
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
There are 3 billion nuclei

1146
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
how to say this sentence

1147
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
What is 30,000 genes

1148
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Then I am also a tiger.

1149
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
that is

1150
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
in our body

1151
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
The achievement of any physiological phenomenon is protein

1152
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Proteins that fight on the front lines, such as

1153
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I see a dog wants to pet me, I want to run faster

1154
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
How can I run faster? My kidneys

1155
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
My kidneys are pumping out adrenaline

1156
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
contract my muscles

1157
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
let me run faster

1158
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So adrenaline is a protein

1159
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
or the one just now

1160
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
That stuff is delicious, my stomach is going to produce acid

1161
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Stomach acid is also a protein

1162
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The achievement of any physiological phenomenon depends on

1163
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
protein to do

1164
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
But

1165
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
People who fight on the front line don't always obey orders

1166
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
What is the total eating order? What I just said

1167
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
A cell inside a cell and a ball of yarn inside

1168
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
DNA inside

1169
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Why? Because we often say a word

1170
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It is now that junior high school students start

1171
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Recite that sentence, what DNA does

1172
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
RNA makes protein, protein expresses function

1173
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
why? because

1174
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
total food order in the body

1175
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
will be based on the present

1176
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I saw a dog wanting to pet me, so

1177
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
The DNA that makes adrenaline turns on

1178
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
DNA to itself

1179
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
as a template

1180
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
make a message

1181
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Let's look at it with a simple diagram

1182
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
DNA imitates in its own message

1183
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Make a simple piece of RNA

1184
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
RNA will help DNA help the general order

1185
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
pass as orderly

1186
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
to whom

1187
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
outside the nucleus

1188
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
that is

1189
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Now it's an adrenaline rush

1190
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
so you want the adrenaline-producing protein

1191
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
How to do it

1192
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
how to do it here

1193
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It is also what our children in junior high school started to learn.

1194
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
It turned out that this RNA was sent out

1195
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
use yourself as a template

1196
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
to catch different amino acids

1197
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
so take care of that

1198
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
eat the night before

1199
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
one thousand three hundred dollars

1200
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
number of steaks

1201
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It's still five yuan for breakfast

1202
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Nucleated eggs are useless

1203
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
eat into our stomachs

1204
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
we'll put thirteen hundred dollars

1205
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
A few steaks or five dollars

1206
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
the protein in that nucleated egg

1207
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Amino acids cut one by one

1208
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
that one amino acid

1209
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
will be based on

1210
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
This RNA series

1211
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
call over

1212
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
therefore

1213
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,500
DNA is different

1214
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,700
RNA is different

1215
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,900
RNA is different

1216
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,500
The amino acid called is different

1217
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,700
Amino acids are different

1218
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,500
The protein produced is different

1219
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,200
therefore

1220
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,900
you see the dog keeps biting you

1221
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,700
you opened

1222
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,400
adrenaline gene

1223
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,000
made out of adrenaline

1224
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,200
You see that delicious food now

1225
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,400
You're turning on the gene for stomach acid

1226
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,500
It is made of gastric acid, the protein

1227
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,600
This is the basics that middle school students are starting to learn now

1228
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,600
Fundamental

1229
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,700
Then tell me what we just said

1230
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,500
More humane liquid difference

1231
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,000
where is the importance

1232
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
because

1233
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,600
everyone is human

1234
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,000
people are the same

1235
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,400
But

1236
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,500
This one actually has a meringue

1237
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,800
what is that meringue

1238
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,500
The DNA in our 46 balls of yarn

1239
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,400
99.9% the same

1240
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,500
almost everyone the same

1241
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,900
Then you say it's so strange

1242
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:52,900
Oddly enough

1243
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,200
Didn't we just talk

1244
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,700
The DNA in our body

1245
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,400
There are 3 billion editing teams

1246
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,000
you put

1247
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,900
3 billion times the remaining 0.1%

1248
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,840
so what

1249
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,460
very big

1250
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,680
3 billion multiplied by 0.1% is what

1251
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,740
3000000

1252
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,240
What will become of this 3 million

1253
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,800
The 3 million decided to say

1254
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,700
We all have hair genes

1255
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,740
But some people have straight hair

1256
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,900
someone has curly hair

1257
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,440
everyone has that

1258
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,700
eye genes

1259
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,300
But some people are slit-eyed

1260
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,600
some people's eyes just look

1261
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,000
That round one doesn't look very pretty

1262
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,300
Everyone has face genes

1263
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,900
But some people can make idol stars look handsome

1264
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,100
But some people look like me and look very ordinary

1265
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,600
so these things

1266
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,700
Although this is 3 billion

1267
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,500
Although in our genes

1268
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,000
percent

1269
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,500
everyone is the same

1270
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,900
This 99.2% is 900 million

1271
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,500
But this little 0.1%

1272
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,600
You multiply 3 billion by 3 million

1273
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,600
It is decided that people are different from people

1274
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,000
These people are different

1275
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,600
as usual some people are taller

1276
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,400
some people are short

1277
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,100
some people are handsome

1278
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:53,800
some people are ordinary

1279
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,100
some people have straight hair

1280
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,500
some people have curly hair

1281
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,400
Some people who smoke make them shorter

1282
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,400
some people

1283
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,760
I will regret not smoking

1284
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,660
Some people are allergic to medicine

1285
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,160
Some people take medicine without allergies

1286
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,500
Therefore, the current medical research

1287
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,260
just want to study this

1288
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,100
3 billion times zero percent

1289
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,760
The nucleotide sequence of the 3 million

1290
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,460
how to explain

1291
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,960
How to decide the development and treatment of the disease

1292
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,060
What's more, many genetic mutations

1293
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,860
or the day after tomorrow

1294
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,360
So this is what we have in mind

1295
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,560
personalized medicine

1296
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,760
That humanized medicine is just mentioned

1297
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,820
We hope to take advantage of the fact that people are different from others

1298
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,660
to explain disease

1299
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,820
disease progression disease treatment

1300
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,860
By taking this into consideration

1301
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,420
Differences in each person's physique

1302
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,660
Impact of treatment on progression

1303
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,420
In fact, this concept has long been

1304
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,120
It was in 2001 AD

1305
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,360
After the so-called genetic decoding

1306
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,420
These 3 billion nucleotides

1307
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,520
After understanding how it is arranged in order

1308
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,920
everyone is full of fantasy

1309
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,680
that is, can we

1310
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,400
Explain that by 0.1 percent of the three billion

1311
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,200
Let's take a look at these treatments for the progression of the disease

1312
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,000
what kind of impact

1313
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,300
that's unfortunate

1314
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:13,000
Over the past ten years or so, our efforts have not been enough.

1315
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,300
It seems that the explanation is still very limited.

1316
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,200
a few months ago this year

1317
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,300
We are in that biomedicine

1318
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,400
The most famous journal is called cell

1319
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,200
It means you and us scientists are not working hard enough

1320
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,900
what we hope

1321
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,000
It is called genomic reach to the clinic

1322
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
That is to say, can the study of the genome be used in

1323
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,300
clinic is clinical

1324
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,800
it talks and talks

1325
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,400
only two so far

1326
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,400
Only two examples in the last year or two

1327
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,600
what is the first example

1328
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,400
The first example is the treatment of skin cancer

1329
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,500
Just talking about a drug for skin cancer

1330
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,300
Then this drug is based on the assumption that there is no genetic allergy

1331
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,900
may decide which one it is

1332
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,000
It's not surprising that we see this

1333
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,500
In fact, we have more famous examples in Taiwan

1334
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,400
It's the broadcast that you often hear on your mobile phone

1335
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,100
just to do

1336
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Targeted therapy for lung cancer

1337
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
The medicine he talked about is called

1338
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
It's called L-Resa Dark Heat Sha

1339
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Because Taiwan was long ago

1340
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Professor Yang Banshi from National Taiwan University Hospital

1341
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
they joined long ago

1342
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
International long-term follow-up study

1343
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
just found one thing

1344
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
That is to say, all lung cancer patients

1345
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
can be based on one is called

1346
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
EGFR is what you hear on the radio

1347
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
performance factor

1348
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Is the receptor mutated?

1349
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
seems to decide

1350
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Who should use it?

1351
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
What does Ivresa say?

1352
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Everyone look at the upper right corner

1353
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
The upper right corner is called EGFR

1354
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
mutant group words

1355
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
The horizontal axis is tracking

1356
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
4 months 8 months 12 months 16 months

1357
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
The vertical axis is the patient's survival rate

1358
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
What about the gray group?

1359
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
The gray group is to eat

1360
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Irresa's group

1361
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
The black group is general chemotherapy

1362
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
You can discover the hypothesis

1363
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
EGFR is mutated

1364
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
sorry i said it the other way around

1365
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,140
The survival rate of eating ERESA is much higher than that of not eating ERESA

1366
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,520
On the contrary, the assumption is that EGFR is good for pigs and sheep to change color

1367
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,340
So now a very important personalization

1368
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,620
some concepts arise

1369
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,400
lung cancer is scary

1370
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,740
Lung cancer can only be treated with general chemotherapy

1371
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,040
Chemotherapy is very large and not necessarily effective

1372
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,120
Can that be based on a specific

1373
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,960
Advertisement for treatment, this is the so-called advertised treatment.

1374
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,520
ERESA is a good example

1375
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:36,620
But he said ERESA is not available for everyone

1376
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:42,240
Because the condition of EGFR should be considered if it is assumed that it is a person with a mutation

1377
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,520
Is ERESA valid

1378
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,840
People who are not mutants are ERESA ineffective

1379
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,120
What is EGFR?

1380
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:51,460
EGFR is what we just said that there is an electric spirit on the surface of every cell

1381
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,800
This electric spirit is one that receives messages from the outside world.

1382
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:55,820
main receptor

1383
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,820
So what is the main role of this electric spirit?

1384
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,600
outer cells say

1385
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,080
If it takes longer, the electric spirit will notify the commander-in-chief in the cells and pancreas to say

1386
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,440
please grow up

1387
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,940
Therefore, many patients with lung cancer just said

1388
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,480
Assuming that EGFR is a mutation

1389
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,240
what is this patient

1390
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,680
His electric spirit can't play when pressed

1391
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,080
Just as the false biography of the holy will said, hurry up and grow

1392
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,640
RESA is the drug that blocks the electric spirit

1393
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,680
The process of passing on the whole message

1394
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,360
Therefore, if EGFR is assumed to be broken

1395
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,680
is RESA valid

1396
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,820
EGFR is supposed to be that normal

1397
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,320
It's the RESA that doesn't work

1398
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,880
So this is a very successful

1399
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,680
The concept of personalized medicine

1400
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,420
For the treatment of lung cancer

1401
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,120
Taking into account the fact that a person is genetically different

1402
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,680
Is it EGFR positive?

1403
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,120
Still EGFR negative

1404
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,360
positive give this medicine

1405
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,560
Negative do not give this medicine

1406
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,760
can determine each patient's season

1407
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,320
as far as our breast cancer is concerned

1408
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,880
It is also related to this EGFR

1409
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,280
EGFR has a relative

1410
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,380
The other name is called

1411
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,280
Another relative of EGF in breast cancer is

1412
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:03,960
burn

1413
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,080
What is HR2 the same as EGF just now

1414
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,560
It is also the electric spirit on the surface of the cell membrane.

1415
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,160
That's an example of long-term tracking

1416
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,440
base it on what was just said

1417
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,320
Hormone receptors are just mentioned

1418
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,520
see the ER

1419
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,800
Or whether HR2 is positive or negative

1420
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,080
Break it down into these groups

1421
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,800
You can find that the worst group is the green group

1422
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,240
The horizontal axis is tracking years

1423
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,640
The main axis is the patient's survival rate

1424
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,080
You can find out who the green group is

1425
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,200
The green group is HR2 positive

1426
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,400
Even if Dianling presses the button, it can't be squeezed out.

1427
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,440
So is it possible to consider a person

1428
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,080
HR2 status to give specific drugs

1429
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,120
Just like considering the status of a person's EGF

1430
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,480
To consider whether he can give ERSR

1431
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,280
Of course the most famous example of breast cancer is this

1432
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,520
Just check the status of that HR2 first

1433
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,800
Now the health insurance bureau is saying

1434
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,960
Suppose to check that HR2 first

1435
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
what is this thing

1436
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
This thing is to see a patient

1437
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Or look at each cell of you and me

1438
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Is the Horn Rabbit over-acting?

1439
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Assuming that the Horn rabbit is normal, it should be

1440
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
The Horn Rabbit given by Dad The Horn Rabbit given by Mom

1441
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
There should only be two red dots

1442
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
But look at this cancer cell

1443
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Horror rabbits have so many points like this cell

1444
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
On behalf of the volume of the Horn rabbit has changed a lot

1445
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
The volume of Hole rabbits has changed a lot, and the power has changed several times

1446
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Of course the cells keep growing

1447
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
So the NHS says

1448
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Assume that the patient is a Holle rabbit

1449
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
If it belongs to more than two planes

1450
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
then specific medicines can be given

1451
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Not only to see if this Horn rabbit is over-performing

1452
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Sometimes to stain the protein of the Horn rabbit

1453
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
When the protein is dyed, it becomes brown

1454
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
You see this is what we say

1455
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
The position of the Horn rabbit is outside the cell

1456
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
your outside is brown brown

1457
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
What about normal cells?

1458
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Normal cells should not be so concentrated

1459
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
But some patients are so strong

1460
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
So for breast cancer

1461
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Horror Rabbit Positive vs. Horror Rabbit Negative

1462
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,060
Hordu-positive people have particularly poor survival

1463
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:08,100
Can it be the same as the IRA killing against the DGA just now?

1464
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,100
Is there any special medicine for Hordu?

1465
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,500
Because if it is assumed to be Hordu positive

1466
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:14,900
If it is known in advance that the patient is Hordu positive

1467
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,300
That should give him special medicine.

1468
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,400
Indeed, health insurance pays for a drug

1469
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,600
It is Hercetin hormone cancer bottle

1470
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,700
That is, assuming the surgical findings say

1471
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,200
if hordu overacts

1472
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,600
you can give him a hormone cancer bottle

1473
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,900
then at most one year

1474
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,800
give him 13 times a year

1475
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,700
He said why is the NHS so stingy?

1476
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:36,200
So personalization together with another concept was born

1477
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,200
We're all talking about targeted therapy now

1478
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,400
They say I should drug people

1479
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,400
Instead of just prescribing the right medicine

1480
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,300
Shouldn't all be just the usual chemotherapy drugs

1481
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,900
It should be seen whether each person is

1482
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,600
Hercetin Hordu positive

1483
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,000
Assuming Hercetin Hordu positive

1484
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,900
Just give him a cancer hormone bottle, a cancer hormone bottle

1485
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,200
There are special medicines for Hordu positive

1486
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,700
But why is the NHS so bright and stingy?

1487
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,800
Because of Hordu

1488
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,800
More than 60,000 yuan is a year

1489
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Health insurance will pay 800,000

1490
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Therefore, the National Health Insurance Bureau did not dare to open

1491
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Hersetting is the first medication

1492
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Later passed by legislators

1493
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
after some surgeons

1494
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Go through a hospital and have a group

1495
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
say no no no

1496
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Breast cancer is now the No. 1 cancer in Taiwan

1497
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
You should consider individualized medicine for each individual

1498
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
don't say anything

1499
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Herto was given only when chemotherapy failed.

1500
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Only to hersetting

1501
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
make it a second medical

1502
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
it's too late

1503
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Should have paid for it from the start

1504
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
But our personalized medicine

1505
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Another concept is emerging

1506
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Consider the cost

1507
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Hersetting costs 800,000 a year

1508
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
every disease

1509
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Everyone said, I want targeted therapy.

1510
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Why is there so much money to build a country?

1511
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
So this is our concept of personalized medicine

1512
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
many derived problems

1513
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
gradually came into being

1514
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
So in another example

1515
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Just another example

1516
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
That's the example we're going to tell you

1517
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
It says that in addition to targeted therapy for cancer

1518
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Another very successful example

1519
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
It was published in March of this year

1520
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Just now Vice President Chen mentioned that our Voice Institute

1521
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,500
With 150 neurologists from 23 hospitals in Taiwan

1522
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,400
Published in the most beautiful heart in the world

1523
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,400
This article in one man's medical journal

1524
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,700
called in the past two years

1525
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,600
One of the two most successful examples of personalized medicine

1526
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,200
he does one thing

1527
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,500
There are three main ingredients in that thing

1528
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,000
the first is medicine

1529
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,900
This drug is called Cover Masben

1530
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,000
what to treat

1531
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,100
Epilepsy and trigeminal neuralgia

1532
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,000
Toothache, trigeminal neuralgia

1533
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,700
Sometimes joint pain

1534
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,700
It is also possible to give this Cover Masben

1535
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,200
it is a very effective pain reliever

1536
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,700
And it can also treat the day

1537
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,200
Also treats bipolar disorder

1538
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,000
Many mental illnesses can give it Cover Masben

1539
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,900
because it's cheap

1540
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,700
This is the first we've seen in this study is Cover Masben

1541
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,500
What about the second one?

1542
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:49,500
That is to say, this drug has a chance to cause the Steven Johnson just mentioned

1543
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,500
third factor

1544
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,100
who will cause steven johnson

1545
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,500
It's the 1502 genotype.

1546
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,900
Thus a concept arises

1547
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,900
can we check one person first

1548
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,500
called HLAV1502 for

1549
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,860
For example, in our lecture hall

1550
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,200
Someone is 1501, someone is 1503,

1551
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,700
If someone is that 3101, don't be afraid

1552
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,200
But suppose it is 1502

1553
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,100
Had a chance to eat cabbage after this

1554
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:19,000
It will be that Stephen Johnson who was so serious just now.

1555
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,500
Then I'm down here

1556
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:24,800
Just use our example to tell you

1557
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,800
Assuming that when personalized medicine is to be

1558
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,400
what kind of things should we consider

1559
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,100
We don't just talk

1560
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,200
This 1502, then we will do genetic screening for everyone

1561
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,840
As far as the whole cabamas this leads to

1562
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,200
steven johnson's 1502 words

1563
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,300
In general textbooks it is called

1564
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,800
This is a very interesting example

1565
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,100
be able to put things that should be considered in personalized medicine

1566
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,500
from start to finish

1567
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,500
So our second half will help

1568
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,600
Take everyone through this process once

1569
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,200
What is the first process?

1570
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,200
In the first process, of course you have to discover

1571
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,500
What kind of person eats Kabob Mas powder?

1572
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:07,500
got that Stephen Johnson so

1573
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,700
You mean that in terms of our research

1574
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,000
you are looking for related

1575
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,200
You have to see if the correlation is strong

1576
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,700
This correlation-inconsistency

1577
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,500
So is this correlation causal?

1578
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,500
or indirectly related

1579
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,500
And is this factor single factor or multiple factor

1580
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,000
let's look at the first one

1581
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,800
How on earth do we find relevant

1582
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,800
Find related in our medicine

1583
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,700
The easiest way is to compare

1584
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,400
Comparing who eats more C-B-Z

1585
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,500
the song just now

1586
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,400
who will get Stephen Johnson

1587
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,400
Better to eat C-B-Z than to get Stephen Johnson

1588
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,700
than two groups

1589
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,200
let's say gene mutation

1590
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,700
1501 1502 1503 3501

1591
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,900
look at which gene variant

1592
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,600
Will be super tall with Stephen Johnson

1593
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,500
tantamount to saying

1594
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,500
Assuming that the gene mutation

1595
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,300
if it has something to do with the disease

1596
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,800
Because I saw people with stomach allergies taking medicine

1597
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,200
He belongs to 1502

1598
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,420
The group of 1502

1599
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,420
people who are not allergic

1600
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,420
Neither belong to the group of 1502

1601
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:08,120
It is indeed our Chen Yuancong

1602
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,120
Inspect my colleagues in the firm

1603
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:13,120
In 2004 the world's most famous

1604
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,120
This thing discovered by Nature Tikan

1605
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,120
Let's start from the top

1606
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,120
he checks 1502 first

1607
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,120
Discover

1608
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,120
People who are allergic to CBZ

1609
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,620
just said

1610
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,120
this group

1611
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,120
of forty-four

1612
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,620
hundred percent

1613
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,620
Generation 1502

1614
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,620
compared to taking medicine

1615
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,620
not allergic

1616
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:36,620
only three percent

1617
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,620
100% higher than

1618
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,620
You say you are different, do you want to be strong?

1619
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,620
100% higher than

1620
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:44,620
that three percent

1621
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:46,620
Then look at other positions

1622
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:48,620
Ninety-three percent to sixteen percent

1623
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,620
Eighty-one percent to ninety-seven and five to eleven percent

1624
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:52,620
None of the other locations

1625
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,620
first position so strong

1626
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:56,620
So this is what we just said

1627
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,620
must think about

1628
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,620
And the cut kind of correlation is

1629
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,000
After that, the story is not over

1630
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Are you looking at whether the correlation is causal or indirect?

1631
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I mean to put it in terms of what I just said

1632
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Just to show you this picture

1633
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I wouldn't say we saw the example

1634
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
This is the Vice President Chen

1635
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
When I graduated from Pop with Us

1636
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
often taken example

1637
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
You see, people who drink alcohol will get short of breath

1638
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Why do you get breathless when you drink alcohol?

1639
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Actually drinkers love to smoke

1640
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Smoking actually causes asthma

1641
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Then why do you get breathless when you see people who drink alcohol?

1642
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
That's because people who drink have to smoke

1643
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
people who don't drink don't smoke

1644
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
What really causes asthma is smoking

1645
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
So you see the relationship between drinking and asthma

1646
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
is an indirect relationship

1647
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
So let's ask a question

1648
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,000
It is the relationship between 1502 and Stephen Johnson mentioned earlier

1649
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Is it the indirect connection between drinking and asthma?

1650
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Or something between smoking and wheezing?

1651
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,760
How do I do it?

1652
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,000
He said that drinkers also love foot soldiers and wolves

1653
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,200
That foot soldier might actually be causing asthma

1654
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,800
Everyone, don't have preconceived notions

1655
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,800
Maybe the cause of the asthma is the foot soldier wolf

1656
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,600
That's why drinkers love cigarettes and drinkers love foot soldiers

1657
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,600
then you can't figure it out

1658
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:19,800
So in the end the cause of the asthma is smoking, drinking or foot soldiers

1659
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,800
Then how to clarify? The medical scientist said

1660
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,600
That’s no way, you need to use other indicators

1661
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,600
For example, do you see if a finger turns yellow?

1662
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,400
Because of smoking for a long time, the fingers will turn yellow

1663
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,200
Can you see if a person coughs? If you cough for a long time, you will cough

1664
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,800
Can you see if a person will have oral diseases?

1665
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,200
Because of oral lesions of the foot soldier wolf

1666
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:42,000
hypothetical hypothetical you can't tell

1667
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,200
Smoking or foot soldier wolf is asthma

1668
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,200
Then suppose it's the foot soldier wolf that really caused the asthma

1669
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,000
what will you see what will you see

1670
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,400
Oral lesions, yellow fingers, cough

1671
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:00,200
No oral lesions, yellow fingers, cough

1672
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
This man is breathing high

1673
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
So it's a very simple principle of medicine

1674
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
You have to further distinguish

1675
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
who is directly related

1676
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
still healthy

1677
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
You are looking for more indicators

1678
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
come to meet, to clarify

1679
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Who is Brother Yuan?

1680
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Therefore, that

1681
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
After academician Chen and the others discovered this correlation

1682
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
To see such a strong correlation

1683
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
who is strong

1684
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
But is it directly related?

1685
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
So he was there

1686
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
That is, we look at this

1687
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
It is the 1.502 mentioned just now

1688
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
right here, elsewhere in the gene

1689
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
because he will be together

1690
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Take off the water, maybe it's the gene next to him

1691
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I'm just showing you this picture

1692
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
that is

1693
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
You can see that the position of a gene is related to the disease

1694
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
He may be reflecting his right gene

1695
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
also left gene

1696
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
like the example i always give

1697
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I take the high-speed rail

1698
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
to Taichung, fly out of Taichung

1699
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
found my friend coming in to pick me up

1700
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I said happily in my heart, why do you think I'm coming

1701
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
you were so enthusiastic before

1702
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
you run to the train station to pick me up

1703
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,360
My friend said you change the car

1704
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,400
I'm not coming to pick you up at all

1705
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,560
He came to pick up his girlfriend

1706
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:06,400
why

1707
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,960
because me and his girlfriend

1708
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,560
Take the same high-speed train

1709
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,760
what does he mean

1710
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,160
Mom and Dad gave us

1711
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,060
Not sent to us one by one

1712
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,400
what mom and dad gave us is

1713
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,260
Chromosomes sent to us one by one

1714
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:22,360
So you find that one of the chromosomes

1715
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,760
A certain position is related to the disease

1716
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,700
Maybe it's the chromosome

1717
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:28,760
next to him

1718
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,160
People who take the high-speed train with me

1719
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,560
maybe that's the one

1720
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,960
who my friend wants to pick up

1721
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,120
so what to do

1722
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,760
Divorce is just like saying

1723
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:37,860
Then you do a few more

1724
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:40,660
Therefore, the laboratory of Academician Chen Yuanhong

1725
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:44,320
What are you doing near 1502 just now?

1726
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,820
HRAR is other

1727
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:47,120
I will read it to everyone

1728
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,120
That's the first one above

1729
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,160
private medicine for allergies

1730
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,220
70 vs. 46

1731
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,760
looks like no difference

1732
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,560
93 against 13

1733
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,820
90 to 4

1734
01:04:57,980 --> 01:04:59,280
start raising

1735
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,040
95

1736
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,920
Change 6, 98 change 4 are very high

1737
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,600
95 becomes 13, and the relative lower one starts

1738
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,400
68 becomes 16, lower

1739
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,600
equal to these you can see

1740
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,040
Starts low, then the correlation gets stronger and stronger

1741
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:16,520
To the lowest, the area where the results intersect

1742
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,520
The only gene is just said HRAB

1743
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,480
So here is to find the relevant

1744
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,360
may be directly related than we think

1745
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,520
indirectly related

1746
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,920
On the other hand, this correlation is in our medicine

1747
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,920
That means there must be so-called consistency

1748
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,920
What about consistency?

1749
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,040
different people, different times, different places

1750
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,360
The results of the research done should be the same

1751
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:43,600
Then the research of 1502 from the 2004 of Chen Academician Tang

1752
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,240
After publishing Nature

1753
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:49,280
Many countries in the world, including Japan, South Korea, Germany, France

1754
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,600
learn from them to do experiments

1755
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,720
It turned out that a very interesting thing

1756
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,200
Everyone look to the right first

1757
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,960
There are four regions

1758
01:05:55,960 --> 01:06:00,480
Including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Washington

1759
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,400
South China, the south of China

1760
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,500
Discover

1761
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,640
CBZ with

1762
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,200
Steven Johnson's relationship is strong

1763
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,400
on the contrary

1764
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,600
What kind of Japan is our neighbor's Japan?

1765
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,600
South Korea

1766
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,900
that german french

1767
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:18,600
Could not find the relationship between CBZ and Steven Johnson

1768
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,800
Why

1769
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,900
here Miri is here

1770
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:25,900
Because none of these people carry 1502 at all

1771
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,800
It is equal to that they are all 1501

1772
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,400
1503 3101

1773
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,100
Others wake up

1774
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,400
on the contrary

1775
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,700
Those strongly correlated regions

1776
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:37,100
Just like us in Taiwan, like us in this classroom

1777
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:38,500
5 out of 100 people

1778
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,000
200 people have 10 people with 1502 ah

1779
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
therefore

1780
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,200
1502 high area

1781
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,500
have a strong correlation

1782
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,000
1502 low area

1783
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
no strong correlation

1784
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
This is another form of consistency

1785
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,100
tell us

1786
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:52,900
this

1787
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:55,500
Probably the culprit of the disease

1788
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:56,700
So it's called

1789
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,500
You really want to personalize medicine

1790
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,100
Of course do some research

1791
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Need some evidence

1792
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
How strong is the correlation

1793
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Whether the correlation is direct or indirect

1794
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
And we don't have time to mention it to you

1795
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Is it single factor or multifactor

1796
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
The first point is really just the first step

1797
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
second step

1798
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
We just compared the past and the past are more relevant

1799
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
But there is no actual data

1800
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Let's get to the bottom of this

1801
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
How must be the factor

1802
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Second, you still have laboratory evidence

1803
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Then Chen Yuan has done a very good job since TV

1804
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
They will come to explain first

1805
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
why Steve

1806
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Steven Johnson skin turns up

1807
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
To paraphrase the sentence just now

1808
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Steven Johnson is our skin cells

1809
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
to commit suicide

1810
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
like once after suicide

1811
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Just bubble water, soak water a few more

1812
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
turn the whole skin over

1813
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Therefore, Chen Yuan first researched from the TV side

1814
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Exactly a Steven Johnson guy

1815
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
the place where the blisters

1816
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
In the end the difference

1817
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Where is the genetic difference

1818
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
this looks complicated

1819
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
actually a bit of skin color

1820
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Three types of organizations, the first one you will see

1821
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
The blistered tissue of Steven Johnson's patient

1822
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
He took out the tissue with blisters and the second one

1823
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
man of steven johnson

1824
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
The Tissue Without Blisters by Steven Johnson

1825
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Just to get blood cells as a control

1826
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
The same person is sick and not sick, and compared to a third person

1827
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
It is the blood cells of ordinary people, you, me, and other healthy people

1828
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Let's compare some genes related to cell suicide

1829
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
It turned out that one of the genes was called Greolizing

1830
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:41,000
You can see that the tissue in the blister is performing better than healthy cells

1831
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Or the patient's healthy cells are significantly higher

1832
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
You said this is also related to cytology?

1833
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Is this correlation causal?

1834
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
He mentioned this kind of Greolizing here, after all, it is to extract the organization to do it.

1835
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
If you really want to see the sick place, you can really get the performance of Greolizing

1836
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
indeed performance

1837
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,280
Show this coffee color

1838
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,800
no performance is no color

1839
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,380
The upper left corner is the place where the blister

1840
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:07,680
The lower right corner is where there is no blister

1841
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,220
where he gets sick

1842
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:11,260
also found that

1843
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:12,540
blisters

1844
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:15,620
It's not as good as being sexually expressive

1845
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:17,660
But these are just related

1846
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:18,420
what kind of related

1847
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,720
have blisters have personal sex

1848
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,000
no blisters no personal sex

1849
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,280
But this personal love

1850
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,480
is it right?

1851
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:25,600
What about Steven Johnson's causality?

1852
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,140
he is doing an experiment

1853
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,400
just put the cells

1854
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,200
One blue dyes one cell

1855
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,220
what to make him

1856
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:32,500
bubble personalities

1857
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,540
You see, after having some personal sex

1858
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:36,080
will turn red

1859
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,140
red is a dye

1860
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:40,100
That's called Ernestine Fier

1861
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,720
What is Ernestine Fierce?

1862
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,000
indicator of suicide

1863
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,020
turn out to be

1864
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:45,800
In terms of cytology

1865
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,120
Cell de-soaking after personal love sex

1866
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,400
cells will have

1867
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,180
Aptosis kills itself

1868
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,480
Therefore, at the cytological level

1869
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,540
proved

1870
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:57,540
Personal love is the cause of cell

1871
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:59,080
Causes of Aptosis

1872
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,100
then you are just cells

1873
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,400
So he beat Glasgow to the rat organization

1874
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,300
After two hours, four hours, five hours

1875
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:10,800
The epidermal cells of mice produce a lot of aptoces

1876
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,280
Therefore, it has been confirmed in front of zoology

1877
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:18,900
The blistered one that Gerasin and the patient saw

1878
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,000
causal correlation

1879
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,600
So he first discovered in 2008

1880
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:28,600
Why One Can Get Stephen Johnson's Molecular Gene Transfer

1881
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,900
The base transfer is in the vesicular tissue cells

1882
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,900
There are many Grassin performances

1883
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,400
The expression of these corusoids will make the cell aptoces

1884
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,500
But this has no answer

1885
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,300
Because the answer we need is

1886
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:45,700
Then why eating CBZ will produce Gorax

1887
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,300
more importantly

1888
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:52,100
Why only the 51502 person will behave

1889
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:56,100
The following is the result of more than a year of hard work

1890
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:57,100
this hasn't been published yet

1891
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,800
Let's keep it a secret

1892
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,800
he first

1893
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,000
He found someone who was allergic to CVZ

1894
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Sorry, patients who eat CVZ

1895
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
take out his blood cells

1896
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Treat him to the CVZ and get his blood cells out

1897
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Treat the general physiological experiment water

1898
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
It was found that these patients

1899
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
His cells once processed CVZ

1900
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
As mentioned earlier, the performance of Glienoxyne is particularly high.

1901
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Therefore, the initial establishment of CVZ

1902
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Let the cells show the causal relationship between Glienoxyne and each other

1903
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Assuming everyone will believe that

1904
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I just talked about Glienoxyne because it causes cellular Atosis

1905
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
That's half the answer

1906
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
But another bigger doubt is

1907
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Then why only 1502 waited to take medicine to be like this

1908
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
It's not 1502 it doesn't look like this

1909
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
it's better to do a study

1910
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
it is written in the heart

1911
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,700
immune response in the body

1912
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:05,800
basically relying on what we just said

1913
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:06,900
HLA

1914
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,900
We say that everyone has

1915
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:11,900
HA has HA1, HA2, 150

1916
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:14,300
What is the main function of this HA

1917
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:20,300
HA is a very important molecule that compares the difference between you and me

1918
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,500
we often talk

1919
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:24,200
This person will have that allergic reaction

1920
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,700
In other words, all organ transplants are rejected

1921
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,100
Why is there rejection

1922
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:29,700
you are 1502

1923
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:31,500
I am 1501

1924
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,500
You kindly donate your blood to me

1925
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,000
1502 meets 1502

1926
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,300
1501 Two HAs are different

1927
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:39,100
cause allergic reaction

1928
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:39,800
Why

1929
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:44,500
Because HA is recognized by some immune cells

1930
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,700
immune cell discovery says

1931
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:46,900
this is not mine

1932
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:48,900
release some hormones

1933
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:52,500
Let cells produce aposis

1934
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,900
So it thinks of one thing in its heart

1935
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:55,900
will that

1936
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,600
will this medicine

1937
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,100
Will be stuck in HLA

1938
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,520
Let one of my immune cells follow my skin cells

1939
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,920
It was a family

1940
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,920
My immune cells should say

1941
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:08,920
This is my own

1942
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:12,920
Will this, this, this medicine get stuck on it?

1943
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,720
let my immune cells say

1944
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,420
If you don't understand this thing

1945
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:17,920
toxins

1946
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,920
So this my skin cells will produce atosis

1947
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:22,420
He came to apply for this matter

1948
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:24,320
But after applying for this matter

1949
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,720
He did a very important research

1950
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,920
That is to say, everyone assumes that slightly

1951
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,840
Those who have studied immunology in high school all say one sentence

1952
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,840
That sentence means

1953
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:38,840
The HA of this cell shows that it has been processed by the cell

1954
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,840
It's like saying we have the flu today

1955
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,840
After the flu virus enters our body

1956
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,840
will be processed by cells in the body

1957
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,840
After processing the flu protein

1958
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,840
Expressed on HA

1959
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,840
Immune cells can't understand

1960
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,840
So he thought the pill was so small

1961
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,760
Those medicines are very small

1962
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,340
Does it need to be processed by that cell to manifest?

1963
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,900
So he did two very important studies

1964
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:10,140
Also this study is also the one that hasn't been published

1965
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:13,040
The first study is to put

1966
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,700
It's a different cell

1967
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,900
Putting the difference to it handles CBZ

1968
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,900
handle two situations

1969
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:21,500
The first condition is blood cells

1970
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:25,440
The second is the blood cells or cells

1971
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,700
The second condition is to shake the cell

1972
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:32,000
He's here to test the drug after all.

1973
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,900
The relationship with this HA

1974
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:36,700
Are they really strong together?

1975
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,600
Just shake it and it's gone

1976
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,400
As a result you can see that

1977
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,800
Gave CBZ or a drug that looks like CBZ

1978
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,600
Assuming that before shaking

1979
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,500
immune response so strong

1980
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,900
After shaking you shake this cell

1981
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,500
he has no immune response

1982
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,800
represent one thing

1983
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,700
That thing is important for immunology

1984
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,200
that thing is to say

1985
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,300
Don't take this medicine the way of traditional flu

1986
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,100
Traditional Flu Way

1987
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,960
After the flu virus is eaten by this cell, it is cut into several pieces

1988
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:07,260
Then the strong ones will stick to the HLA

1989
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:10,460
But from this experiment, it seems that after shaking it, it disappears.

1990
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:15,360
The representative said that the relationship between this drug and HLA is very slight.

1991
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,360
glued together

1992
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,960
Does not seem to require treatment by cells

1993
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:19,960
This is the first one

1994
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,960
to prove this

1995
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,960
He's going to treat the cells with another drug

1996
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,660
Called Paraformer Op.1

1997
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:29,160
What is the main function of the main chemical drug in this medicine

1998
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:33,520
Let the outside of the cell build a layer of copper and iron walls

1999
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,620
where is the purpose

2000
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,360
keep outside things out

2001
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,520
what's inside can't get in

2002
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,560
he means

2003
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:42,420
Assuming that this drug does not need to be processed by cells

2004
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:43,760
there will be a reaction

2005
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,420
That means you build an iron wall

2006
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:50,220
had no effect on the stimulation of the immune response

2007
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:51,560
everyone can see

2008
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,960
Immune response before and after dosing

2009
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,560
no difference

2010
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,620
represents what

2011
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:59,980
Means this medicine is not needed

2012
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,300
Run into the cell and be processed by the cell

2013
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,300
send it out

2014
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,700
Because you borrowed the same foot blood wall

2015
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,900
The contents should not be delivered

2016
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,100
Things outside can't get in.

2017
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:08,800
therefore

2018
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,300
It leads to a very important basis transfer

2019
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,300
that is

2020
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,800
CBG is such a small medicine

2021
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,400
immune response

2022
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,800
Probably not the traditional flu route

2023
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,500
It will be directly stuck on this HA

2024
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,000
With this evidence

2025
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,700
It can directly do an experiment

2026
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:27,000
that experiment is

2027
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:32,400
Check the annual ability of CBG and HA

2028
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,100
therefore

2029
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,500
The famous result comes out

2030
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,600
someone is 1501

2031
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,400
someone is 1502

2032
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,200
Someone 1503

2033
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,400
Someone 4001

2034
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,000
Someone 5101

2035
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,400
View separately

2036
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,700
CBG is the drug just now

2037
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,400
or strong structure

2038
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,000
Much like ECBG

2039
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:47,800
see separately

2040
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,800
The annual capacity of CBG and 1501

2041
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,400
It is tantamount to directly examining the two-year

2042
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,200
Because since we don't directly deal with

2043
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,600
you can see

2044
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:57,000
will it stick to it

2045
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,200
it turns out

2046
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,000
1501 can't stick 1501

2047
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,840
Live in 103 years, live in 4001 years, live in 510 years, live in 510 years

2048
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:04,540
only what?

2049
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:08,700
1502 is closely related to the strong adhesion of this medicine

2050
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,000
So, the mystery gradually picks up

2051
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,560
Why only 1502 etc. are allergic?

2052
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,100
that is because

2053
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:18,180
Everyone takes CVD medicine

2054
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:21,500
But only after 1502 took the medicine

2055
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:26,100
This pill will stick to it very strongly

2056
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,660
1501 will be sticky, but shake it and it will disappear

2057
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:30,460
1503 Shake and disappear

2058
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:33,780
But only 1502 will stick to it strongly

2059
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,060
Can't shake it down

2060
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:37,620
Then you stick to one cell, of course you don’t understand

2061
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:39,420
Because there is an extra piece of this kind of thing on the top

2062
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:42,740
Release the Genericin just mentioned to him

2063
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:44,540
Once the Genericin is released

2064
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:47,340
The Apocytus just seen produced

2065
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:49,660
So these bits and pieces understand the evidence

2066
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:52,980
Including the discovery that Genericin is a part of Apocytus

2067
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:55,540
and Keeneb explains 1502

2068
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:57,580
Why do only 1502 and so on get sick?

2069
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:59,580
So found out that

2070
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,400
basic evidence

2071
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,400
So for a personalized medicine

2072
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,260
Why is it called the most successful story abroad

2073
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,600
You will start with the initial

2074
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,360
This is then further correlated with laboratory evidence

2075
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,960
to find the basal rotation that it says takes place

2076
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:16,900
With these foundational transfers,

2077
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:19,660
We can really use it in clinical use

2078
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:23,400
But clinical application is not as easy as imagined

2079
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,900
This is why our study

2080
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:28,360
Reasons to be in the New England Journal of Medicine

2081
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,320
The reason for this being in the New England Journal of Medicine

2082
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,320
definitely not that we found

2083
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,360
CBZ will cause Didi to do this because of 1502

2084
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,160
what are the details

2085
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,820
Discovered in 2004

2086
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:40,820
And the academician and his laboratory also found that the base transfer

2087
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,980
One of the greatest successes of this study is that

2088
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,020
we really proved that

2089
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:48,560
Genetic Screening Before Medication

2090
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:51,020
under the right circumstances

2091
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:53,560
in an appropriate clinical setting

2092
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:56,060
Genetic screening before this medication

2093
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:59,060
Allergic reactions after anti-depressant medication

2094
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,020
then let's see

2095
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,460
What does the research here tell you?

2096
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:03,960
This thing is known to everyone

2097
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,460
Personalized medicine is really used clinically

2098
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:08,260
is a very important thing

2099
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:10,160
That is what we often say

2100
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:14,460
You have to take into account positive predictive value and negative predictive value

2101
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:16,160
What kind of positive predictive value negative predictive value

2102
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,660
We see that the horizontal axis is

2103
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:20,960
Allergic to medicine

2104
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,160
There are two kinds of people who are not allergic to medicine

2105
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,160
The heavy axis is the check

2106
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,960
1502 is positive

2107
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,960
1502 is negative

2108
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:31,720
1502 people will be allergic to medicine

2109
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,720
Than 1502 will not be allergic to medicine

2110
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,420
Strong correlation

2111
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:36,160
we just said

2112
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:39,320
The correlation is about 1357 times

2113
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:41,920
But a strong correlation does not necessarily mean

2114
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,220
You can use it in personalized medicine

2115
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:45,520
because of personalized medicine considerations

2116
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,720
Not so-called sensitivity and specificity

2117
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,920
What sensitivity specificity is

2118
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,560
among people allergic to medicine

2119
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,920
How many people are in 1502

2120
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,320
Among those who are not allergic to medicine

2121
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,320
How many people are not in 1502

2122
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,780
Sensitivity is especially high

2123
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:04,340
This stuff doesn't mean anything to patients.

2124
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:05,720
What does the patient care about?

2125
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:07,440
count from above

2126
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,440
suppose i'm positive

2127
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,520
Will I be allergic to the medicine?

2128
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,680
assume i'm negative

2129
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:16,280
Is it okay if I take the medicine?

2130
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,920
This is the so-called positive awareness value

2131
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:20,000
Negative Awareness

2132
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,560
Positive Awareness Points, Negative Awareness Points

2133
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:24,280
basically depends on sensitivity and specificity

2134
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,960
and to what extent

2135
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:29,840
In terms of whether 1502 is allergic to medicine

2136
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,960
Positive consciousness value is ultra-low, only 5.6%

2137
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,360
Only 5.6%

2138
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,840
Suppose you are 1502 positive

2139
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:39,080
As far as we are concerned, there are about 10 of the 200 people

2140
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,080
you eat CBG

2141
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,720
He said my dentist gave me CBG

2142
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,680
Do not worry

2143
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,960
There will really be 4 out of 100 talents and 5

2144
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,160
95% of people are fine

2145
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,880
Then you say of course checking this is useless

2146
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,480
But this research

2147
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,400
The most important thing about this TES is the negative awareness value

2148
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,000
close to 100%

2149
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,960
99.9%

2150
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,800
what negative district medical set value

2151
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,840
if you are negative

2152
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,120
that is

2153
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,940
Almost you don't have to worry that you will be allergic to the medicine

2154
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:09,220
is B

2155
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:11,000
B plus the lower of the first cent

2156
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,820
Just assuming you're a negative person

2157
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:14,840
you probably

2158
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,400
Take medicine 99.9%

2159
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,440
not allergic

2160
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,000
So this is for a patient

2161
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,280
one thing I care about most

2162
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,580
I am positive can I eat or not

2163
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:26,620
I am negative can eat can not eat

2164
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:28,920
Just CBZ and Steven Johnson

2165
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,500
With 1502 and CBZ cited by Steven Johnson

2166
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,060
Although the positive predictive value is not very good

2167
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:36,860
negative predictive value

2168
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:38,140
almost super high

2169
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:40,960
Once you tell people that if you are Naked

2170
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,000
you can almost safely take your medicine

2171
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,280
that's what we just said

2172
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,320
we are in our holy clinic

2173
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,620
in two years

2174
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:49,400
invited in Taiwan

2175
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:54,780
The help of 150 neurologists in 23 hospitals within two years

2176
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:56,060
A total of invited

2177
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:59,860
4,855 patients who had the opportunity to take CBZ

2178
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,360
Genetic screening before medication

2179
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:08,160
Decide if the assumption is negative

2180
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,160
Said please rest assured to take medicine

2181
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,300
positive?

2182
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,960
that means please be careful

2183
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,240
you better change your medicine

2184
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:15,460
How many are negative?

2185
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:17,660
92.3%

2186
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:18,640
positive?

2187
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:19,840
7.7%

2188
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,440
The 7.7% said

2189
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,200
please change your medicine

2190
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,040
because

2191
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,460
Although you are only 5.6%

2192
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:26,360
But

2193
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:27,640
Professor Stephen is so serious

2194
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:28,800
you better not eat

2195
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,040
but what is important

2196
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,760
If it is negative

2197
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,160
you can rest assured to eat

2198
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:35,240
So feel free to eat if you are negative

2199
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,360
positive dressing change

2200
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,960
Then start tracking for two months

2201
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:38,760
Let's talk

2202
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:40,400
Is it by this

2203
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,840
Genetic Screening Before Medication

2204
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:45,640
Can really prevent after medication

2205
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,060
allergic skin reaction

2206
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:48,760
At the beginning, of course we counted

2207
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:49,960
masculine and feminine

2208
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:52,840
Neurologists in Taiwan

2209
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,060
Who will drive CBZ?

2210
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:58,360
Results Among our more than 4,800 patients

2211
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,600
14% are bumps

2212
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Then there is 54.14% neuralgia

2213
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
The vast majority of patients in Taiwan who take CBZ

2214
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
One out of two suffers from neuralgia

2215
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Only 14.24% of codes and

2216
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
What about other neurological symptoms?

2217
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
So it's just that we start with the basic data of the patient

2218
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
what we just said

2219
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
800 people in this world do genetic screening first

2220
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Follow up for two months

2221
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Negative take medicine lightly

2222
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
If positive, ask him to change the medicine

2223
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
As a result, during these two months

2224
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Although we cannot avoid

2225
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
It's positive and negative

2226
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Those symptoms such as itching

2227
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
rash, blisters

2228
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
There are different situations of mouth ulcers and itching

2229
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
among the positive

2230
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
among negative people

2231
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
more or less there will still be some

2232
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,000
a slightly uncomfortable allergic reaction

2233
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
itchy blisters

2234
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
But what?

2235
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
What we care about is the following

2236
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
but in this world

2237
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Of the 4800 patients

2238
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Positive patients are 0

2239
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Negative patients are 0

2240
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
from now on

2241
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
no more steven johnson

2242
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Among the 4800 patients

2243
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Although we can't

2244
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
completely prevent

2245
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
The comparisons just mentioned

2246
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
mild allergic reaction

2247
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
But the worst Steven Johnson

2248
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Among our 4800 patients

2249
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
During the two-month follow-up

2250
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
completely invisible

2251
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
so this is

2252
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
What the New Infectious Medicine Journal said is that

2253
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
by pre-medication

2254
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
1502 Genetic Screening

2255
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
can really avoid

2256
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Really take that CBZ

2257
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
caused by steven johnson

2258
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
just avoid it completely

2259
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
He said why he succeeded

2260
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
There are several conditions for success

2261
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Although these conditions are examples of our study

2262
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
But everyone is going further

2263
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
We have to think about it at the end and say

2264
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
If you want to succeed as a personalized medicine

2265
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
There are several conditions

2266
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
First

2267
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
The Light of Our Taiwan

2268
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,600
You have to check CBZ very well

2269
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:06,000
then you should get checked

2270
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,600
Taiwan's medical and public health standards are very high

2271
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:12,000
It is equivalent to the clinical level of a country's public health

2272
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I have to be very tall to be qualified to say that I want to do personalized medicine

2273
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Otherwise, you can't even diagnose the disease.

2274
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I can't figure out whether it is the drug diagnosis, the red diagnosis or the lung itching

2275
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
How can you do personalized medicine if you can’t figure it out?

2276
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
so it was a great success

2277
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
A very important condition of this study in Taiwan is that

2278
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Taiwan's own medical and public health standards are high

2279
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,000
The following more detailed reasons, for example, the first reason

2280
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:42,000
We're close to 100% negative predictive value

2281
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
So this is a very successful drug in this study

2282
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
100% negative predictive value

2283
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Just assuming that's the case, take the medicine with confidence.

2284
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:56,000
At this point, everyone is thinking about the relationship between breast cancer and vegetarianism just now.

2285
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Sugar content is not related to obesity

2286
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Think of these positive healers, negative healers

2287
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
you will understand

2288
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
why why those chronic diseases

2289
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
There is no way yet to take into account a person's genetic status

2290
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
risk of disease to a person

2291
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
make a very accurate assessment

2292
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Caused by 1502 and CBG

2293
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Steven Johnson Negative Healers Are Only Nearly 100%

2294
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
So we can safely say

2295
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
You're Nectin you're hardly weak at any price

2296
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Just go take your medicine, it's fine

2297
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
This is the first requirement for success

2298
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Second, did he think of one thing?

2299
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
When we were doing this research it was

2300
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
alone alone

2301
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Deciding only after diagnosis

2302
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
To take medicine or not to take medicine

2303
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
You just want to die alone

2304
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
You said you have to wait, wait a day, wait two days

2305
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
tell you it's positive positive

2306
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
So the more successful elements of this study

2307
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
This sounds uneducated

2308
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
But you're talking about clinically important

2309
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Because our testing reagents

2310
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
results in three hours

2311
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Send the report and delay

2312
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Another two days

2313
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,320
So this also sounds uneducated

2314
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,800
But this is also the basic spirit of personalized medicine.

2315
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,520
Suppose you want to wait a year and a half by yourself

2316
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,760
just said you can take medicine

2317
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,320
People have already died of pain

2318
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,960
People quit a long time ago

2319
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:16,320
So here's what you're gonna say

2320
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,000
Pre-Medication Genetic Screening to Help After Medication

2321
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,360
to decide whether to prevent

2322
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,520
allergic reaction after use

2323
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,040
This is also a very successful factor

2324
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,400
no knowledge at all

2325
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:28,000
But we only need the patient to wait two days

2326
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:28,800
you can talk to him

2327
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,800
you can eat you can't eat

2328
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,520
It is also a very successful requirement

2329
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:33,960
The third

2330
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,400
alternative medicine

2331
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:37,640
suppose

2332
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:39,920
Check it out and say you can't eat it

2333
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:40,960
what to do

2334
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,840
No way, good way, you know the pain at home

2335
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,200
then why should i check

2336
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,480
You also have a medicine called Actonative medicine

2337
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:49,160
You have to find another way to go

2338
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:50,200
you have to tell people

2339
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:51,360
assume you are positive

2340
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,440
Suppose you want to change the medicine

2341
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,440
what should you do

2342
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,000
assuming it's useless

2343
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,960
Then why do people want to do personalized medicine?

2344
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,520
so this stuff sounds uneducated

2345
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,080
but it is

2346
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Our research shows that

2347
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,500
If you really want to do personalized medicine

2348
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:08,000
You need to be able to cooperate with the whole environment

2349
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
You have to consider these seem not very knowledgeable

2350
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,500
This is called the editor over there

2351
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:19,000
To a very appropriate called proper clinical setting

2352
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,500
appropriate clinical configuration

2353
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:24,500
This clinical configuration includes the whole country and the whole environment

2354
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:27,000
Public health and clinical standards can match

2355
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:32,000
And how strong is the relationship between the disease itself and the gene?

2356
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
and the relationships just mentioned

2357
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:39,500
So this is the third step of what we call personalized medicine here

2358
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:43,000
That is, you left with relevant basic evidence.

2359
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
if you really want to do it

2360
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,500
You have to take into account positive inhibitory values, negative inhibitory values

2361
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:50,000
You also need to consider other allergic reactions caused by this disease

2362
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
What to do about your rash, the clinically feasible approach

2363
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Can the patient wait for two days?

2364
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Probably can't wait for two weeks, and check it out

2365
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
That is to say, our research

2366
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,200
Our inspection department sometimes says it is too complicated

2367
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,880
I don't want to do it. Maybe he strikes with you sometimes.

2368
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,400
You do a good job of developing those test designs

2369
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,080
and the alternatives just mentioned

2370
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,160
Is there an alternative? Suppose there is.

2371
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:14,960
It's really about personalization.

2372
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,040
So I can’t go back to the Hershiting I just talked about

2373
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:20,240
nature has revealed that clue economics

2374
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,400
This sentence means

2375
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:26,960
We published it in the Sexy Together journal

2376
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,440
The best journal in the world We are very good in our hearts

2377
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:33,200
Proud of our central PR city

2378
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,240
a press conference is about to be held

2379
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:38,040
because it can be a great sight

2380
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,880
As a result, the press conference, the reporter came

2381
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,880
Reported the next day, the first media said

2382
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,000
This is a major breakthrough in personalized medicine, benefiting from these seven years

2383
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,200
Because it is to let the foreign media say the same

2384
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,080
But everyone turned over

2385
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:54,200
You go Google my name and you can find

2386
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,400
I was scolded badly by you

2387
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,520
Because the Central News Agency said a word

2388
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,560
That sentence really puts us in a strong mood

2389
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,300
Don't miss the butterfly, what did he say?

2390
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:03,300
called

2391
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:08,700
For three yuan of medicine, you need to do a genetic screening for three yuan and three thousand yuan

2392
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,800
During this period, we suddenly acted violently. Scientists cannot handle scientific matters.

2393
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,300
You have to take into account, economics

2394
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:18,300
CBZ only costs 3 yuan for a medicine

2395
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:22,000
You want health insurance, health insurance is now almost 1502 genetic screening

2396
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Check a 1502, health insurance costs almost three thousand dollars, is it worth it?

2397
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:29,300
Therefore, personalized medicine cannot

2398
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:32,600
I am very proud that the dominant activity of personalized medicine is unreasonable

2399
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:35,600
You have to think about the situation in a real society

2400
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:39,100
Can it be accepted in the end, so when we

2401
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:43,200
Of course I can't wait, the Central News Agency's Cheng Xiao can still be broken

2402
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,900
In hindsight, it's because he made us think

2403
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:50,300
Personalized medicine can't just be scientific research

2404
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:53,000
Not only, as I just said, pharmacoeconomics should be taken into consideration

2405
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,400
Therefore, we are not experts in pharmacoeconomics

2406
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,000
Let's do the math

2407
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,600
In the past few years

2408
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,760
How is the use of CBZ in Taiwan?

2409
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:03,840
you can find

2410
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:05,960
You see these curves

2411
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:08,620
Dark blue and light blue are the same

2412
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:12,540
is that you found that from 2002 to 2008

2413
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:16,120
CBZ usage actually declined

2414
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:17,660
you think

2415
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,720
such an effective medicine

2416
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:22,520
So cheap, a painkiller that costs 3 yuan is so cheap

2417
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:24,320
It's the cheapest of all medicines

2418
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:25,600
Why is it getting lower and lower

2419
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:29,960
The incidence of that Steven Jones is actually getting higher and higher

2420
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:31,040
Why

2421
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:34,200
After 2004, we did not just talk about

2422
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:37,840
Academician Chen and the others published in the famous Nature in 2004 that

2423
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:41,520
1502 is after CBZ what caused Steven Jones

2424
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,040
Everyone dare not prescribe that medicine

2425
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,960
So after 2004

2426
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,520
CBZ has been falling

2427
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:47,760
you don't want to be that

2428
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,440
It means you don't want that or that

2429
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,760
The flower of the tight pen said that I have a very good test

2430
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,800
I'm telling you now that I don't do tests at all

2431
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,600
I just need to change the medicine.

2432
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,160
What do you have to worry about 1502

2433
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:00,040
Just change your medicine

2434
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,020
So it prompts us to think about one thing

2435
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:04,220
that's where we come to see

2436
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:05,820
think of one thing is to say

2437
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:08,100
Then we have to actually calculate

2438
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:11,620
In the end personalized medicine is really used in a society

2439
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:12,560
one country

2440
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,620
What about medical costs

2441
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:16,820
How much does it affect

2442
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:19,260
that's a good point to say

2443
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:21,180
1502, Steve Johnson

2444
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:22,700
It is mentioned in foreign textbooks one day

2445
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:24,220
This is the best example

2446
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:26,940
because of trigeminal neuralgia

2447
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:29,020
are two different situations

2448
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:32,680
In addition to CVD

2449
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,020
there is another medicine

2450
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:35,860
It is neurotic, gupmenting

2451
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:38,520
It's a very good medicine

2452
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:41,220
gupmenting is a bit of Steve Johnson's part

2453
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:43,760
CVD is what you have to worry about is it 1502

2454
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:46,460
So suppose a patient in the margin

2455
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,020
If he wants to eat CVD

2456
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:49,960
in accordance with current standard practice

2457
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:50,760
you have to do it first

2458
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:55,420
You have to spend 3,000 yuan for genetic screening first

2459
01:32:55,420 --> 01:32:57,220
Assuming it is a network

2460
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:59,220
You can rest assured to eat CVD

2461
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,400
Because BZ is very cheap, it only costs three yuan a day

2462
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:05,100
The annual drug fee is 2300 yuan

2463
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:08,900
So 2300 plus 3000, one year we don't care

2464
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:10,900
In fact, patients with epilepsy can't just watch for a year

2465
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:13,100
Epilepsy patients move up because they eat for a long time

2466
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:19,200
So assuming it's CBZ plus that 1502 genetic screening

2467
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:21,900
It costs 5300 yuan a year

2468
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:25,700
But some people say I just change the medicine

2469
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:26,900
why do i take this risk

2470
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:29,800
Neurotin costs 11 yuan a piece

2471
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:31,700
It costs 10,000 yuan a year to eat

2472
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:34,700
10,000 to 5300 which one is calculated

2473
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:35,900
Of course this calculation

2474
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,400
so this is

2475
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:40,500
execute us, we are very grateful to that miss chen

2476
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,000
help us tell you

2477
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,100
Although you said three thousand dollars

2478
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:48,600
Three dollars will cost 3,000 dollars for a genetic screening

2479
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:51,600
it sounds unreasonable

2480
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,400
But in the long run

2481
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,600
Epilepsy patients have to take medicine for a lifetime

2482
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,600
even if you change the medicine

2483
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
very expensive

2484
01:33:59,000 --> 01:33:59,800
certainly

2485
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
We don't deny assuming you have money and are willing to pay for it

2486
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,160
Willing to spend 10,000 yuan a year

2487
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,660
then you really are your business

2488
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:09,560
But considering a country

2489
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,060
2,0003 plus 3,000

2490
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:12,860
And genetic screening only needs to be done once

2491
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:15,260
Because whether we are who or not in our whole life is 1502

2492
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:16,900
If you check once you do it

2493
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:18,160
That will have a lifetime impact

2494
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:21,200
It is to sign a document 2,0003 2,0003 2,0003

2495
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:22,800
This is 10,000 plus 10,000 plus 10,000

2496
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,160
In the long run, it seems that this is relatively accounting.

2497
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,860
This is a case of subversion

2498
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:30,320
Indeed, from the point of view of the subverted patients

2499
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,920
Although there are good alternatives to

2500
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:35,120
Can not eat CBZ

2501
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,420
Immediately switch to alternative medicine

2502
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:38,460
But as things stand now

2503
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:40,560
Several common alternative medicines

2504
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:43,420
There is no accounting from CBZ

2505
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:44,220
should say so

2506
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:48,020
There is no calculation other than CBZ plus genetic screening

2507
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:50,620
This is a case of subversion

2508
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:51,520
the second

2509
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:52,420
Three margins

2510
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:53,220
Didn't we just talk

2511
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:55,020
Taiwan does have 50% of the people

2512
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:56,620
It's because of stacking pain and three plus scores

2513
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:57,620
So we still eat CBZ

2514
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:59,880
But another story happened

2515
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,420
for trigeminal neuralgia

2516
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:04,420
CBG is the front line

2517
01:35:04,420 --> 01:35:07,420
and there is no alternative

2518
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:08,920
won't be like that

2519
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,920
There is copamenting in that side

2520
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,920
trigeminal neuralgia

2521
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:14,420
CBG is the best medicine

2522
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:16,420
so there is no alternative

2523
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:17,220
you have to think

2524
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:19,220
Another way to think about talking to people

2525
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:20,620
just think

2526
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:23,420
How much does it cost me to prevent a patient

2527
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:25,120
and i don't prevent

2528
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,120
I let him go free

2529
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,420
I use ex post compensation

2530
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:29,620
How much do you have to pay

2531
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:31,240
we really count

2532
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,240
Steven Johnson caused by CBG

2533
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:35,740
The incidence rate is about 0.24%

2534
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:37,240
According to the data we have just demonstrated

2535
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:38,540
can be calculated

2536
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:40,540
So let's say 1000 patients

2537
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:43,040
If multiplied by 0.24%

2538
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:45,340
1000 are CBG's

2539
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:47,340
If multiplied by 0.24%

2540
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:49,620
There will probably be two Steven Johnsons

2541
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,120
So 1,000 people on pills

2542
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,620
there will be two steven johnson

2543
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:54,120
Those 1,000 people multiplied by the

2544
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,940
It costs 3,000 yuan to do a screening

2545
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:58,240
3000 times 1000

2546
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:59,340
is 3 million

2547
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,300
3 million divided by two patients

2548
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:03,740
3 million divided by 2

2549
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:05,240
That's 1.5 million

2550
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:06,400
he means to say

2551
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,340
You want to prevent a trigeminal neuralgia

2552
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:11,840
People who eat CBG and get Steven Johnson

2553
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:14,340
You prevent a Steven Johnson on average

2554
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:17,340
it will cost 1.5 million

2555
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:19,340
Then suppose I don't prevent

2556
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:20,240
that's too expensive

2557
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,500
shall we accompany

2558
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,240
Let's do the math here

2559
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,740
Vital Relief Foundation

2560
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:27,840
Steven Johnson has several conditions

2561
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,040
no sequelae

2562
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,680
Some people have very serious sequelae

2563
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:31,780
eyes will go blind

2564
01:36:31,780 --> 01:36:34,200
Of course some people will die

2565
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:36,780
The vast majority of Steven Johnson are very serious

2566
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:39,540
But 92% of people

2567
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:43,200
In the end, the skin will be healed after half a year

2568
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,480
For treating a Steven Johnson

2569
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:48,280
Almost 400,000 in health insurance

2570
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:50,900
that for those who are blind

2571
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:53,340
Only 0.2%

2572
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:55,880
Health insurance almost 1 million

2573
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:59,540
5.26% for the unlucky

2574
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:00,880
Taiwan underground

2575
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
How much is a human life worth?

2576
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
two million

2577
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
So you multiply 400,000 by 0.29

2578
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
1 million times 0.02

2579
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
2 million times 0.05

2580
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
count up

2581
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Average to pay

2582
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
You don't do any fund screening

2583
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
you pay on average

2584
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
A Patient of Stephen Ginger

2585
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
The state will spend 500,000

2586
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
1.5 million vs. 500,000

2587
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
which one compares

2588
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Of course 500,000 accounting

2589
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
but this thing

2590
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
At the Department of Health

2591
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
The Drug Harm Relief Foundation

2592
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Indeed, some teachers of medical economics say

2593
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
you pay

2594
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
1.5 million vs. 500,000

2595
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Of course this calculation

2596
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
But then I thought of what example

2597
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I think it is an example that you often see in newspapers

2598
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
kill the driver

2599
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I'd rather kill someone

2600
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
I don't want to put a person

2601
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
crippled

2602
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Isn't that what it looks like?

2603
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I think you just let happen

2604
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
It's fine for the country to pay

2605
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,200
Because the compensation is only 500,000

2606
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,580
You need 1.5 million to prevent one

2607
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:04,040
Both are 1 million

2608
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:05,840
Because why is there such a difference

2609
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:08,080
because we didn't count a single person

2610
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:09,080
After being disabled

2611
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:11,080
We don't count after a person dies

2612
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:12,780
his life's loss

2613
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:16,680
In the current medical economics, there is no formula

2614
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:17,880
the second

2615
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:19,880
Our society in Taiwan

2616
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:22,580
Can this really be allowed to happen?

2617
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:24,180
can really say

2618
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:26,540
Then once something happens to compensate

2619
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:28,440
Then don't come and do precautions in advance

2620
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:30,320
Some doctors even say

2621
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:33,180
say in terms of medical standards

2622
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:36,820
What is one thing that can be prevented and not prevented

2623
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:38,520
illegal

2624
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,420
This does not mean that it can be prevented and cannot be prevented

2625
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:42,980
Now that Academia Sinica is very old

2626
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:44,980
Study says 1502 has good checks

2627
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:46,680
Come for 1502 genetic screening

2628
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:48,680
But why should we consider

2629
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:50,380
Is it ethically reasonable?

2630
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:53,120
and social affordability

2631
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:54,420
we really this society

2632
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:57,080
Really only care about the difference between 1.5 million and 500,000

2633
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,120
certainly

2634
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:00,120
we are a scholar

2635
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,160
It's the Central Asian crowd garden. How can we

2636
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:03,600
Taiwan is so developed

2637
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:04,840
How can you care about 1 million

2638
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:08,600
But Vice President Chen used to be the Director of Health

2639
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:10,040
It's different when he sees here

2640
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:12,560
Because every disease is like this

2641
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:15,000
You have to choose breast cancer and tell you

2642
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,240
The 800,000 yuan for Heshan disease is also worth spending

2643
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:19,560
When that lung cancer, that Aresa

2644
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,240
Your health insurance is so much money

2645
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:24,500
So what is the use of limited resources to treat

2646
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,340
Heart to Pusture Breast Cancer Patient

2647
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:28,760
Or to prevent a CBG

2648
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:30,360
caused by steven johnson

2649
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:32,520
that's a hard choice

2650
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:34,360
so this thing has no answer

2651
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:38,120
This thing just prompts us to think carefully

2652
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:41,520
Personalized medicine is really coming to an end

2653
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,360
When you really have to calculate medical costs

2654
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:45,120
Your country has to choose to say

2655
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:47,320
where are you going to put your resources

2656
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:49,960
So this Steven Johnson with

2657
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:53,320
The relationship between 1502 and CBG

2658
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:56,120
is a very good example from a textbook

2659
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:57,720
Find related from the beginning

2660
01:39:57,720 --> 01:39:59,980
Take our new person to basic research

2661
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,560
So it depends on how to do it clinically to be effective

2662
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:05,360
and being a reporter we ignore

2663
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:07,520
HK's so-called medical economics

2664
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,560
So this is a really good example

2665
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:12,720
Tell us how personalized medicine should be done

2666
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:15,120
Finally, tell us that is personalized medicine

2667
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,520
is to take into account the differences from person to person

2668
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,960
But the difference between this person

2669
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,960
Finally, what we just said

2670
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:24,760
The 1502 and CBZ we just mentioned

2671
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:26,160
caused by steven johnson

2672
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:29,320
That's a strong hurdle that's monofactorial

2673
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:32,280
is now what we encounter

2674
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:35,840
Hypertension Diabetes Cancer Cardiolipidemia

2675
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,680
and the occurrence of disease

2676
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:39,040
Disease treatment is simple

2677
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,120
You can give different drugs according to different patients

2678
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:42,440
but what happens

2679
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,840
That is to say

2680
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:47,680
Let me take that as an example of a study by Vice President Chen.

2681
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:49,000
That's the study just now

2682
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:53,160
Their study looked at the liver function of a person at the same time

2683
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:54,920
People with poorer liver function

2684
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:57,320
His one has a higher risk of liver cancer

2685
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:59,000
or according to just said

2686
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,120
Qixing should research the virus

2687
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,060
Assuming that it belongs to the first type of management

2688
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:04,860
It is equivalent to adding three factors into the

2689
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:06,140
Just mentioned three factors

2690
01:41:06,140 --> 01:41:07,940
High or low viral load

2691
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:09,740
Then liver function is good or bad

2692
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:13,060
And in the end HCV belongs to

2693
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:15,100
bad type or good type

2694
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:18,440
Six situations are better than just one situation

2695
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:22,780
More accurate prediction of a person's risk of liver cancer

2696
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:24,060
This means that

2697
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:26,620
for complex diseases

2698
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:29,440
Nothing like 1502 and CBG caused

2699
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:30,460
Steven Johnson

2700
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:32,260
Because it is a single cause

2701
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:34,040
But for liver cancer

2702
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:36,100
Liver cancer caused by type C liver cancer

2703
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:38,400
you have to take into account besides you

2704
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,200
Beyond the highs and lows of type C liver cancer

2705
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:42,500
You have to consider the quality of liver function

2706
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:44,300
you have to consider someone

2707
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:46,840
In the end, type C liver cancer belongs to the strong and the weak

2708
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:48,640
Therefore, the concept

2709
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:50,940
It is used in the treatment of the five cancers we just talked about

2710
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:52,740
We just said that the assumption is

2711
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:54,540
Her to Pasitidon

2712
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:56,060
Can give him and setting

2713
01:41:56,060 --> 01:41:57,600
Here is another example

2714
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,600
Supposed to be Her to Pasitidon

2715
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,560
Can two medicines be given? One is Leftal Role

2716
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,240
One is that Tamazifen

2717
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:08,000
I didn’t just say that Leftal Role can cause serious osteoporosis

2718
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,440
So what is the way a person can decide to say

2719
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:14,880
Should I give Leftal Role or Tamazifen

2720
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:18,480
Then those of us who study breast cancer discovered one of the genes

2721
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:21,440
That gene is called CYP2D6

2722
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:24,320
Why? The Tamazifen that I ate

2723
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,320
It's not about grabbing the position directly.

2724
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:30,160
But through the activation of the gene CYP2D6

2725
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:32,480
Thus a concept arises

2726
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,840
Suppose my CYP2D6 is very strong

2727
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,520
Then I'll go eat Tamazifen

2728
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:39,440
if i'm weak

2729
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:42,960
Just go and eat this trick obediently with peace of mind

2730
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:45,280
Really long track looks like

2731
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:47,520
2008 really looked like this

2732
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,680
What to track after 5 years

2733
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:53,200
All kinds are breast cancer survival

2734
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:57,040
You can find that two of them survive the best

2735
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:00,000
The top group is gray and this line is what I just said

2736
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,460
The group that ate meat had the best survival rate

2737
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:03,660
I don't need to talk about it just now

2738
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:04,860
but it has side effects

2739
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:06,140
but you found out

2740
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:08,200
there's another set that's as good as it

2741
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:09,940
That group of dots is this group

2742
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:11,100
Tama 7

2743
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:13,740
Plus CYB2D6 is part of

2744
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:16,460
Mom and Dad give good words

2745
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:19,340
Its survival rate is almost as good as that meat

2746
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:22,500
Conversely which group is the worst

2747
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:24,060
That's Tama 7

2748
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:28,340
Or if you add CYB2D6 and only bet on changing the epidemic situation

2749
01:43:28,340 --> 01:43:31,100
That is to say, eating equals to no effect

2750
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:33,300
So the other one just mentioned

2751
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:35,500
You have to decide what a patient wants to eat

2752
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:37,800
Lovers and love kings still grab the position

2753
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:40,140
Then do CYB2D6 gene screening first

2754
01:43:40,140 --> 01:43:41,340
If it is positive

2755
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,100
you don't go to that to endure

2756
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:44,700
that very complicated pause syndrome

2757
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:46,700
you go eat one cheap and effective

2758
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:47,640
heavy duty medicine

2759
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,140
That hypothesis is CYB2D6

2760
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:50,800
If it belongs to the bad genotype

2761
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,380
Then come and eat this obediently

2762
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:55,900
This is also a contribution of personalized medicine

2763
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:56,840
the same reason

2764
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,900
Progressive treatment

2765
01:43:58,900 --> 01:43:59,940
from just now

2766
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,600
Just come with the example of bacterial hepatitis virus

2767
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:05,800
or Liptoid CYB2D6

2768
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,200
Or the Tamasibin example

2769
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:09,800
Tell us about progressing treatment

2770
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:11,400
to use more indicators

2771
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:14,000
Some of these indicators are external factors

2772
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,300
For example, is bacterial hepatitis virus strong or weak?

2773
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:20,000
and factors within governance

2774
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,200
Is liver function good or bad?

2775
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:25,900
Or is my CYB2D6 a strong worker or a weak worker?

2776
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:28,100
can determine the occurrence of disease

2777
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:30,600
Disease progression and disease treatment

2778
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:31,600
this is what we're talking about

2779
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:33,700
Customized Personalized Medicine

2780
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:38,400
But it's really going to get to the point we imagined.

2781
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,300
We use this picture to show you Chinese painting at the beginning

2782
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:44,000
Finally, let’s look at the famous Spanish Road No.

2783
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,500
Called Diago Velasquez

2784
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,900
A picture he drew is called the picture of ladies and gentlemen.

2785
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:49,100
What is the picture of ladies and gentlemen?

2786
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:51,200
He is Ukishi Taxi

2787
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,000
he painted little spanish princesses

2788
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,500
There is a group of ladies and gentlemen next to him

2789
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:56,200
Also includes things like come to make him laugh

2790
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:59,900
And the dog keeps coming by his side

2791
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,640
Just this little Spanish princess to make him laugh

2792
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:03,960
these people serve him

2793
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:05,320
That's why it's called the picture of the maid

2794
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:07,480
So what is Diego Velazquez painting

2795
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:10,360
What he paints is what he is here is a sense of painting

2796
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:12,840
Vilazquez even drew himself in it

2797
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:15,040
Whose house is he drawing until the end guess

2798
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,920
inside the mirror

2799
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:19,440
The father and the queen are here

2800
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:22,040
He means that this picture drawn by Vilazquez is

2801
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:24,080
The father and the queen stand in front of this

2802
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:26,960
He was drawing his daughter bored beside him

2803
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:29,360
Next to it is a group of maids to make him laugh

2804
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:30,880
dog to accompany him

2805
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,960
The maid came to make him laugh

2806
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:34,920
So this is Diago Vilazquez's version

2807
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:38,320
On the right is the B.Casso version

2808
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:41,400
Put the painting of the maid by Vilazquez

2809
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:43,080
where did you say the princess

2810
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:44,080
princess is here

2811
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,440
The maid is probably this

2812
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:48,200
the dog is probably this

2813
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,920
Then Vilazquez is a little unclear here

2814
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:54,120
I use this to mention

2815
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:56,480
1502 with diabetes

2816
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,040
1502 and breast cancer

2817
01:45:58,040 --> 01:45:59,480
1502 with lung cancer

2818
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,960
As far as 1502 is black and white

2819
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:06,340
Because as far as 1502 the relationship is strong

2820
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:08,640
Three genes, people are people, dogs are dogs

2821
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:11,440
But the high blood that we generally care about

2822
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:14,160
Diabetes and cancer

2823
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:15,280
Must-have version

2824
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:16,640
everyone contributes a little bit

2825
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:17,880
That is to say

2826
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:19,640
in the past

2827
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:21,880
one or two big genes

2828
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:24,680
He decided to go east or west or west

2829
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:27,320
But the chronic diseases we often talk about

2830
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:29,760
It's a bunch of little dick genes

2831
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,240
common combination

2832
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:33,120
You're looking for the disease impact of large genes

2833
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:35,080
That's like 1502 to decide

2834
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:36,680
State 1 caused by CPG

2835
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:38,040
well done

2836
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:40,200
Great for Personalized Medicine

2837
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:42,560
Because of the single factor relationship and

2838
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:45,280
But suppose we're talking about chronic diseases

2839
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:47,680
If it's a combination of a lot of little dick genes

2840
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,680
How much should it be reduced

2841
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:50,720
Is it enough to subtract five? Is ten enough?

2842
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:51,640
thirty is enough

2843
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:54,200
Take the example of breast cancer that I am most familiar with

2844
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:55,360
where are the benefits

2845
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,960
good thing is to say

2846
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:59,200
Thanks to medical scientists and

2847
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,080
technologist progress

2848
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:03,520
They develop some biochips

2849
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:06,880
Capable of whole-genome scanning

2850
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:09,480
It is equivalent to saying that a 1502 should be checked before

2851
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:11,480
3 hours or 3 days

2852
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:15,880
But the one at Academia Sinica is called the National Genotyping Center

2853
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:19,280
He can check 500,000 genetic markers in one morning

2854
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:22,560
In this way, it can be considered at the same time

2855
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,720
The effect of a large number of small cages

2856
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:25,880
two aspects

2857
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:27,680
used to be expensive to make

2858
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:28,520
What now

2859
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:31,520
Now it's time to advertise our national genotype

2860
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:36,520
Assuming that the whole genome scans 600,000 positions

2861
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:38,560
We say that there are 3 billion genomes

2862
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:40,680
How much does it cost to make a 3 billion

2863
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:41,840
In fact it is not expensive

2864
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:44,480
I heard that Taiwanese people in that country and Wang Jianmin did it

2865
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:46,600
A person is 300,000

2866
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:47,680
300,000 is not expensive

2867
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:48,480
Of course expensive

2868
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:51,240
But 300,000 can take you 3 billion

2869
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:54,280
Re-read that genetic locus

2870
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:55,320
Do you say it's expensive?

2871
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:55,960
not expensive

2872
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:56,520
not bad

2873
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:58,640
The 300,000 is slightly used for the provincial branch

2874
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:00,040
That one or two years can be responsible

2875
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,820
Not to mention, suppose you said genetic typing

2876
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:04,640
It only costs 4,000 yuan per person. What is genetic typing?

2877
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:07,000
That is to say, you have a high-speed rail car

2878
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,840
You don't need every passenger to ask him if he is

2879
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,280
You just need to look at one person

2880
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,640
It’s like you can do it with all high-speed trains

2881
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:15,240
You can see a few representative

2882
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:17,240
Just look at a few representative words

2883
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:19,040
Only 4000 yuan per person

2884
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:21,560
4000 yuan in Taiwan

2885
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:23,040
Probably everyone can afford it

2886
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,200
So you want a personalized medicine

2887
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:27,000
On the one hand, technological advances

2888
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,760
On the other hand, because of the cost reduction

2889
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:32,520
lead to find this little dick gene now

2890
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:34,600
much more important than before

2891
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:38,200
Then the example of diabetes mellitus we just talked about

2892
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:40,160
It's what you saw in the upper right corner just now

2893
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:41,880
Obese people more likely to develop diabetes

2894
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:43,280
But in 2008

2895
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:45,880
Whole genome scanning

2896
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:48,080
16 loci were found

2897
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:49,840
As a result, the 16 loci

2898
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:52,480
Can find small differences in Datong

2899
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:53,240
why

2900
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:55,760
The horizontal axis is a person's obesity index

2901
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:59,040
Obese people are more likely to develop diabetes

2902
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:00,040
Watch DJ getting more and more

2903
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,580
But we just talked about genetic screening and humanized medicine

2904
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:05,400
Definitely not saying obesity is important

2905
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:06,280
still important

2906
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:07,680
The fatter you are, the easier it is to get obesity

2907
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:09,120
but where is the point

2908
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:11,880
The focus is to find the small differences in the great same

2909
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:13,640
Under the same obesity index

2910
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:15,880
Plus 16 loci for genes

2911
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,800
The number of bad genes is 8, 9, and 10

2912
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:18,600
11 12

2913
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:21,640
The greater the number of bad genes, the higher the risk

2914
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:24,880
So it is equal to the occurrence of diabetes

2915
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:28,000
Traditional risk factors combined with genetic screening

2916
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
can affect a person's risk of developing diabetes

2917
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
make a more accurate assessment

2918
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Just now my Vice President Chen mentioned

2919
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
My laboratory participated in the world's first

2920
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
so-called genome-wide breast cancer screening

2921
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Whole Genome

2922
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:46,000
The most important gene is called FGF2

2923
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
It's in different labs all over the world

2924
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
The horizontal axis is the so-called risk

2925
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Different laboratories around the world

2926
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Including my laboratory at Academia Sinica

2927
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Abbreviated as BCST is Bress Cancer Study

2928
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
in the land of Taiwan

2929
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,000
It is said that this FGF8 degree assumption is not good to carry out

2930
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,960
It is 1.3 times more dangerous

2931
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:05,160
Everyone says it's taller than one

2932
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:06,840
but please pay attention

2933
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:09,500
1.3 is not 13 is not 130

2934
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:12,740
How much was Steven Johnson just now? More than 1300

2935
01:50:12,740 --> 01:50:15,460
This is the so-called Xiaorouluo gene

2936
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:17,300
more complex disease

2937
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:18,900
you have to explain the occurrence of the disease

2938
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:21,660
It's just a combination of a lot of Xiao Rouluo genes.

2939
01:50:21,660 --> 01:50:23,900
So for these little soft genes

2940
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:25,860
How to use it in personalized medicine

2941
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:29,040
There are many different controversies at present

2942
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:30,540
some people say

2943
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:32,840
Because of the advancement of technology

2944
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:36,440
I can reduce the cost of technological progress

2945
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:39,500
I can put all these things in health insurance later

2946
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,800
that way you can afford it

2947
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:43,300
but some people can say

2948
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:45,300
This little Rourou gene is only 1.3 times

2949
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:46,440
1.3 times the words

2950
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:49,100
So how much can it contribute?

2951
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:50,040
that's in our breasts

2952
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:52,540
Because it has the most genetic screening sites in the world

2953
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:53,640
so would like to say

2954
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:57,400
Can we take the whole genetic competition just now?

2955
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:59,960
The most important thing about the name of the station is the first place, what AGR

2956
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,200
Can we make better predictions about diseases?

2957
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:05,300
His answer is here

2958
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:07,400
Just in industry last year

2959
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:10,160
It is also the world's most famous Journal of New Geology

2960
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:13,400
Use the medical model to tell us that

2961
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,700
Suppose he uses a very complicated statistical model, I can't even understand it

2962
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:17,360
He said ten points

2963
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:19,160
The ten loci with less global gene power

2964
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:21,560
In addition, did you have any children just now?

2965
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:23,860
See if you can predict

2966
01:51:23,860 --> 01:51:25,700
The case of a girl suffering from five cancers

2967
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:27,300
Can we make better predictions

2968
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:28,260
two conclusions

2969
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:30,260
The first conclusion is quite pessimistic

2970
01:51:30,260 --> 01:51:31,560
what is the first conclusion

2971
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:34,460
Called Gail plus Sneed equals Gail

2972
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:35,220
What is Gail

2973
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:36,520
You go to the website of the National Health Bureau

2974
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:39,520
Gailmodel is based on traditional risk factors

2975
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:43,360
To assess how likely a girl is to have five cancers

2976
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,620
traditional risk factors

2977
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:46,360
Plus genetic screening for ten loci

2978
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:48,260
The predictability that can be equal to Gail

2979
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:49,420
what is that

2980
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:52,220
Cooperating with genetic screening is one point

2981
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:53,260
so far

2982
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:55,320
Suppose you only do ten

2983
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:56,660
traditional risk factors

2984
01:51:56,660 --> 01:51:58,260
Predictions for Female Breast Cancer

2985
01:51:58,260 --> 01:51:59,560
not much help

2986
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
The pessimistic side What is the optimistic side?

2987
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Suppose you only do ten positions

2988
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,000
You get the same predictability as Gale

2989
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
This is the optimistic side why?

2990
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Everyone assumes that they have done Gale

2991
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
He asked you, how old are you?

2992
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Just because I don't understand

2993
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Is it 11 years old? 12 years old or 13 years old?

2994
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Can not remember

2995
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Traditional risk factors rely on recall

2996
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Not very accurate, but the screening of genetic loci is very accurate

2997
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
A is AP is B

2998
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
A concept learned from the words of Gale just now

2999
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
You use a more accurate method

3000
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
compared with an inaccurate method

3001
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Both seem to have similar risk assessments

3002
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
but so far

3003
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Assuming you only do ten

3004
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Probably the contribution is very limited

3005
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
The last question is

3006
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Here is a list of the whole genome physiology scans

3007
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Me and my friends abroad

3008
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
You can see that most of them are white

3009
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
overwhelmingly white

3010
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
All European countries and U.S. dollars

3011
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Our group ranks the top ten for breast cancer in the world

3012
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:09,000
The top ten starts from the first place, what HG's vomit

3013
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Then I write red to represent that these ten are very important

3014
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
My purpose is not to memorize this number for everyone.

3015
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,000
where is the point

3016
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
assuming only us asians

3017
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
That's us Taiwanese

3018
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Among the ten, the only important one is this

3019
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,000
top two

3020
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:28,000
In other words, personalized medicine even if everyone has done a full-body scan

3021
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,000
There are also his characteristics among different races.

3022
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
that is mentioned here

3023
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
For example, here's another breast cancer researcher

3024
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
We are also invited to participate

3025
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Even we Asians have formed an Asian alliance

3026
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Find friends in Shanghai

3027
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Friends of Tianjin Friends of Nanjin

3028
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Taiwan is our Hong Kong

3029
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,000
One locus found in chromosome 6 is particularly important

3030
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
This is a representative of invalid

3031
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
More than one is effective

3032
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,000
But you can see that this position is common in Japanese

3033
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
we are here

3034
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
they will get closer

3035
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,800
Then at the white man, almost next to E

3036
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:03,080
Black people change color on pigs and sheep

3037
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:04,360
he means to say

3038
01:54:04,860 --> 01:54:06,660
between different races

3039
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:09,220
The same point has different importance

3040
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:09,980
therefore

3041
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:10,760
And finally this

3042
01:54:11,260 --> 01:54:12,040
personalized medicine

3043
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:13,820
We really want to personalize medicine

3044
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:14,600
on the one hand

3045
01:54:14,860 --> 01:54:17,160
Need more political evidence

3046
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:21,500
It means that every case must be considered, starting from the first step

3047
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:23,800
What to look for evidence related to the basis

3048
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:27,640
Can it be done clinically, can't be done by public health practitioners, and medical economics

3049
01:54:27,900 --> 01:54:28,160
The first point

3050
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:29,440
Second point

3051
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:33,800
It's just that you have to think that now it's all a combination of Little Lolo's genes

3052
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:37,120
Never again do you think that one or two big genes can determine

3053
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:37,880
Even if all

3054
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:38,660
third point

3055
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:39,680
between races

3056
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:40,700
Differences

3057
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:42,500
The effect is

3058
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,060
If you want to understand the influence of Little Lolo's genes

3059
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:46,600
You want a large sample size

3060
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:48,640
You need to understand the influence of different races

3061
01:54:48,900 --> 01:54:49,920
you want a different race

3062
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:53,240
Make his own personalized medicine basic information

3063
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:54,280
So in the end it is

3064
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:55,560
Our Central Medical College started

3065
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:56,840
biological database

3066
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:00,120
It was under the leadership of Vice President Chen that he aspired to be our president

3067
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
The instruction means that since we

3068
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:05,520
Since personalized medicine is a future trend

3069
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:08,840
Since you need a large sample for personalized medicine

3070
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:11,400
Empirical data are specific to people of different races

3071
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:14,040
then we'll build a biobank

3072
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:17,600
This is to help you find these empirical materials.

3073
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:18,840
Let the next generation

3074
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:22,280
Let the next generation come back to find these empirical evidence

3075
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:25,440
When the polygenic influence

3076
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:28,200
There is no need to track another five, ten, or twenty years

3077
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:30,800
So this is the one in our center

3078
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:33,720
Our dean is trying his best to promote this left and right

3079
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:35,960
Taiwan biological database and biomarkers

3080
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:38,840
Dean Chen Wu is now leading the project

3081
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:40,560
Then I'll make a fool of myself tonight

3082
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:42,600
Yes, it's late everyone, thank you all

3083
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:49,200
thanks a lot

3084
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:53,320
This wonderful speech by our deputy director Chen Zhiqiang

3085
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:56,800
From the part of medicine to the part of humanities, social economics

3086
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:59,280
The whole involve to personalized medicine

3087
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:00,440
a little late

3088
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,600
but we will allow you to ask a question or two

3089
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:04,600
Is there a very...

3090
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:07,400
The problem of not being able to go home today

3091
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:09,400
come please

3092
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:13,900
that i have two questions

3093
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:17,800
One is that you have found 1502 and SBG

3094
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:20,800
then it is directly related

3095
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:25,400
So why is it only 5.8% in that positive predictive value

3096
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:26,900
This is the first question

3097
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:28,400
The second question is to say

3098
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:33,600
CBG is now used for that trigeminal neuralgia

3099
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:35,700
only drug of choice

3100
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:38,400
Then if after going through the disaster volume

3101
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:41,700
It turned out that it was not suitable for this drug

3102
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:44,300
But you said there is no alternative medicine

3103
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:46,800
What should we do at this time?

3104
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:48,600
The second question is a clinical question

3105
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:51,700
As far as my clinician friend is concerned,

3106
01:56:51,700 --> 01:56:53,200
Suppose it is 1502

3107
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:54,500
because of trigeminal neuralgia

3108
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:57,400
We joke that the pain is bearable

3109
01:56:57,500 --> 01:56:59,500
He said you just have to bear it

3110
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:00,000
So when...

3111
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,400
So far, the three-pronged dust has penetrated 1502 positive words

3112
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:06,600
In fact there is no medicine

3113
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:09,800
Then usually everyone will make some comparisons

3114
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:11,400
less effective pain relievers

3115
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:13,400
Just eat like R-Spitling

3116
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:14,400
is this

3117
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:15,600
What if it doesn't work then?

3118
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:16,600
It didn't work and I cried for two days

3119
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:18,400
That pain will go away

3120
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:19,600
But every day is different

3121
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:21,000
Every day is a lifetime thing

3122
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,200
So this is what you just mentioned

3123
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:24,200
no alternative medicine

3124
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:26,000
What is genetic screening useful for?

3125
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,600
suppose i know

3126
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:31,400
What is that CIP2D6

3127
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:33,200
The physical fitness of the doctor who treats the positive doctor is so poor

3128
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:34,400
Then why am I doing genetic screening?

3129
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:35,600
so this has no answer

3130
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:36,900
you are right

3131
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:37,600
no answer

3132
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:39,000
This is what drives us

3133
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:39,700
many people say

3134
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:41,600
You scientists are desperately trying to discover a bunch of agents

3135
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:43,200
But really clinically

3136
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:44,700
where is the contribution to public health

3137
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:45,800
I'm sorry about this

3138
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:46,900
we don't have an answer

3139
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:48,400
so far

3140
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:50,800
That put it mildly or because of some

3141
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:54,400
Just take the medicine that doesn't seem to be effective

3142
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:57,200
Anyway, the pain took two days to bear.

3143
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:59,100
Then the first answer is to say

3144
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:00,200
why positive

3145
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,240
Positive-negative predictive value so high

3146
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:03,600
Positive negative predictive value so low

3147
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:05,920
This responsible person is the head of this Liu Qing's graduate essay

3148
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,440
screening tool

3149
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:08,800
screening tool you are equal to

3150
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:11,000
Are you looking for false positives or false negatives

3151
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,760
your criteria you want your screening tools

3152
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:17,600
Able to cut the masculine from the feminine

3153
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,440
But there must be overlap between the two

3154
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:21,280
some people will be fine with medicine

3155
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:22,400
Some people take medicine

3156
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:24,560
Some people will be fine if they don't take medicine

3157
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:26,240
Then where do you cut the point?

3158
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:28,400
For example, what is called high blood?

3159
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:31,760
you can set it at 200 you can set it at 160

3160
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:33,240
you cut 160

3161
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:34,640
Say 160 is a person with high blood pressure

3162
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:35,720
you should exercise more every day

3163
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:36,920
you'll catch a bunch

3164
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:38,600
high blood pressure not high blood pressure

3165
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:40,800
Conversely, suppose your high blood pressure is cut to 200

3166
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:43,040
you will die a lot

3167
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:46,840
That is not high blood pressure is not high blood pressure

3168
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:48,800
That's what we just talked about

3169
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:51,200
The sensitivity and specificity

3170
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:52,680
The level of sensitivity and specificity

3171
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:54,840
It involves what we just said

3172
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:56,600
Positive vs Predicted Value vs Predicted Value

3173
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:57,920
What I just said is because we actually have some

3174
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:00,160
In fact, it is interlocking

3175
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Back to the fact that it's simple math

3176
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,360
In this way, keeping the total number unchanged

3177
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:06,800
You still go to that I believe you will understand

3178
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:10,200
why? this may be a better answer

3179
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:13,200
In fact, I have just been in the clinic

3180
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:16,200
or positive predictive value

3181
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:18,700
means you may have

3182
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:21,800
I might get tested for nasal pregnancy cancer

3183
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:24,300
But what if I say Epstein-Barr virus positive?

3184
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:27,000
My chances of actually having nasal pregnancy cancer are maybe 10%

3185
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,300
But this 10% is very important to me

3186
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:32,300
Because it is a serious disease that requires early detection and early treatment

3187
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:34,300
I would rather

3188
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:38,300
Let me tell you that there is a possibility that I have nasal pregnancy cancer

3189
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:40,800
Then I will go for further treatment for nasal pregnancy

3190
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:43,300
allow me to get further diagnosis

3191
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:45,300
So it doesn't matter if the positive predictive value is low

3192
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:48,300
But I'm going to tell someone that you definitely don't have nasal pregnancy cancer.

3193
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:51,300
You must never say that the nasal pregnancy cancer he used later

3194
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:54,300
So we sometimes choose a high negative predictive value

3195
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:55,800
But the positive predictive value is not too high

3196
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:58,300
Because we still have further diagnostic opportunities

3197
01:59:58,300 --> 02:00:00,300
We can use something like this

3198
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,020
to carry out

3199
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:02,040
that this

3200
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:05,380
I think this one we wait maybe we can try again

3201
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:06,140
again

3202
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,420
try it and talk

3203
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:08,960
Just now there is another question, isn't it?

3204
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:12,540
No, there is another lady coming

3205
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:12,800

3206
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:22,780
Excuse me

3207
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,060
consult

3208
02:00:24,580 --> 02:00:25,340
vice director

3209
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:28,660
That's an average room

3210
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:30,720
all the troubles of women

3211
02:00:30,980 --> 02:00:34,820
That is to say, most girls after menopause

3212
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:36,620
there are two

3213
02:00:36,860 --> 02:00:39,420
The associate doctor will advise him to take hormones

3214
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:42,240
Then some doctors suggested not to take hormones

3215
02:00:42,740 --> 02:00:44,280
That

3216
02:00:44,540 --> 02:00:47,620
The reason for suggesting not to take hormones is

3217
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:48,640
explain

3218
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:52,220
you may get it if you eat it

3219
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:53,500
right

3220
02:00:54,020 --> 02:00:54,780
That

3221
02:00:54,980 --> 02:00:58,100
The first person who took hormones because of you

3222
02:00:58,360 --> 02:00:59,900
they usually

3223
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:05,000
In the end, it will cause the devil in the womb

3224
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
What about the devil in the womb?

3225
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:10,000
The method used by doctors before

3226
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:14,000
That is to say, do a uterine scraping action

3227
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
then it's ok

3228
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,000
So the doctor also said

3229
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,000
If you eat it, you may return to uterine cancer

3230
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Now it's breast cancer

3231
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,000
what is the relationship between these two

3232
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
please teach me

3233
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
We don't have very complex inquiries from here

3234
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
What is the role of hormones?

3235
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Sudden death breast real body

3236
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
But another role for hormones

3237
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Assuming hormones are true if not good

3238
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Then we don't need hormones long ago

3239
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Why hormones control body temperature

3240
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Educational real estate stocks say

3241
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Why does a person have a fever after menopause

3242
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
red face

3243
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Why eat that after menopause

3244
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
The so-called hormone replacement therapy

3245
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
HRT

3246
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Because some people after menopause

3247
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
You will feel the nausea, vomiting and fried red just mentioned

3248
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
It's hard

3249
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
So when standing in the objective point of the sub-factory

3250
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Then you make it up?

3251
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
But to make up for it, judging from the benchmark just now

3252
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
it's easy

3253
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,500
That promotes cell proliferation that leads to breast cancer

3254
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:06,600
Therefore the same

3255
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:08,600
The concept of personalized medicine was born

3256
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:12,400
Who will eat properly

3257
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:13,300
so just right

3258
02:02:13,300 --> 02:02:15,200
This is what we are studying now

3259
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:15,760
that is

3260
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:16,700
just a word

3261
02:02:16,700 --> 02:02:17,800
HRT words

3262
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:19,500
some people eat very fast

3263
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:22,100
Some people just happen to grow up to that twenty

3264
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:23,100
won't get breast cancer

3265
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:24,800
But it can prevent a person

3266
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:27,400
That word still has a lot of research points of view

3267
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:28,800
in terms of food

3268
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,600
Now you ask the surgeon to

3269
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:32,700
Obstetricians have different views

3270
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:33,600
because

3271
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:34,500
practically

3272
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:36,200
This hormone replacement therapy

3273
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:38,100
The risk of breast cancer is

3274
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:41,200
1.3 times more than not eating

3275
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:44,500
Equal to 1.3 is 0.3 more than 1

3276
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:46,500
His obstetrics department must tell you

3277
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:49,700
Secondhand smoke is twice as likely to cause breast cancer

3278
02:02:49,700 --> 02:02:50,200
often speak

3279
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:51,900
You are not afraid of your husband smoking.

3280
02:02:51,900 --> 02:02:54,700
Why are you afraid that HRT will get breast cancer?

3281
02:02:54,700 --> 02:02:56,600
So the surgeon said

3282
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:58,000
important risk factor

3283
02:02:58,100 --> 02:02:59,100
you dare to eat

3284
02:02:59,100 --> 02:03:00,000
So the surgeon with

3285
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
The concept of negative productivity revolution is different

3286
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Of course we most hope that our scientists

3287
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
So the conclusion is not to eat subtleties, right?

3288
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Do not eat subtle

3289
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:12,000
But some people just feel uncomfortable, so what should I do?

3290
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Let's eat for that negative productivity revolution

3291
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Then check it a few more times, that is, people do photography every two years

3292
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:23,000
You do it every six months now, not to mention that some people may have breasts

3293
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Before the cure, there was a cover point, as I said just now

3294
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Then you'd better not eat it because you are a high-risk situation

3295
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Then this is where the concept of personalized medicine comes in.

3296
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Then we'd like to do some more genetic testing.

3297
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:36,000
I found that whoever eats it will be just right

3298
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,000
That's where we scientists haven't worked hard enough

3299
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:42,000
That is also the related one followed by

3300
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:46,000
That is to say, the hormone itself is released after a girl's menopause

3301
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,000
She'll increase yours just by taking that hormone

3302
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:54,000
would increase your hormone production, right?

3303
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Hormones are equivalent to a power source of a human body

3304
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
you must have this hormone

3305
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Only then can many things in your body function more normally

3306
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
so it's good to say

3307
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
is it possible

3308
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:12,000
For example, after a girl shuts down

3309
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
she's been on hormones for a while

3310
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
nothing happened

3311
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Then she felt bored and didn't bother to eat.

3312
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
too lazy to eat

3313
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
another ten years

3314
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:25,000
She felt that there was the situation that caused the shutdown before

3315
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:28,000
For example, the heartbeat is a little irregular

3316
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:32,000
or sarcasm or bad sleep or something

3317
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Can she still eat and drink at this time?

3318
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:36,000
sure

3319
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:39,000
So this one uses the same more honorable medical concept

3320
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Let's compare two groups

3321
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
One group is to taunt after shutdown

3322
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
One group will not taunt after shutdown

3323
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
It costs 4,000 yuan to do it

3324
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
4,000 yuan for a group energy scan

3325
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Let's see where the mocking gene is

3326
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
then you can decide to say

3327
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,000
who should eat and who should not eat

3328
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
So a lot of the concepts we're talking about today

3329
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:57,000
It's actually very simple

3330
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Our cost determination

3331
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Advances in technology, many things that were not possible before

3332
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
able to make better predictions

3333
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
This is where our medical scientists work hard

3334
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
That is to say, it still depends on the person

3335
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,000
because of people

3336
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
People with conditions can eat it

3337
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Yes, the straight line is just saying eat tomatoes, okay?

3338
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Of course it's good. Do you want to eat five or ten or one?

3339
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Everyone is different

3340
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Scientists hope to put that

3341
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Find out the genes that are different for each person

3342
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,000
OK thank you

3343
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:29,000
pregene sequencing

3344
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
About every three to five years

3345
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Just drop from 300,000 to 30,000

3346
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Now technology is advancing rapidly

3347
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:36,000
the future is like

3348
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
when did you say it

3349
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
In fact, he emphasized that the latter is very important

3350
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,000
When the influence of this gene is very small

3351
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Most diseases are genetic

3352
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Effects of interacting with the environment

3353
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,000
For example, eating foods high in sterol

3354
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
but my steroid metabolizing genes

3355
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
are different

3356
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Then this reactivation is very important

3357
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
i have bad genes for example

3358
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,000
i used to do

3359
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
If a person eats aflatoxin

3360
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,000
will get liver cancer

3361
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,200
But if it has a good read gene

3362
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:05,700
If it is called GSTM1T1

3363
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:06,900
No matter how much toxin it has

3364
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:07,700
it read it all

3365
02:06:07,700 --> 02:06:08,900
It won't get liver cancer

3366
02:06:08,900 --> 02:06:10,600
this kind of person

3367
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:11,400
Exotics

3368
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:13,100
It doesn't matter what he eats

3369
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:14,800
but if your genes are bad

3370
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:16,700
If there is no way to understand

3371
02:06:16,700 --> 02:06:18,000
then please don't eat

3372
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,500
Things that contain aflatoxin

3373
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:20,300
So what about the future?

3374
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:21,600
it's more about the environment

3375
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:23,800
The influence of interactions with genes

3376
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:25,000
what you just said

3377
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,900
Hormonal factors are the same

3378
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:27,800
if we know

3379
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:29,400
Hormone basics in the human body

3380
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:31,900
he in different women

3381
02:06:31,900 --> 02:06:33,400
he has different genes

3382
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:34,400
his that

3383
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:35,900
Manifestations of stalled syndrome

3384
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:36,800
not the same

3385
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,600
Then if we understand more and more

3386
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:40,700
then we can

3387
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:42,600
tailor-made for everyone

3388
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:44,200
How much hormone should he take

3389
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:45,900
at what stage should you eat

3390
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:47,400
if after a while

3391
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:48,100
what happened again

3392
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:49,700
At what stage should you eat

3393
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:51,400
then if by that time

3394
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:54,800
Well, medicine can help you a lot.

3395
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:57,800
So let's all look forward to the day

3396
02:06:57,800 --> 02:07:00,000
We can all learn more about ourselves

3397
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,900
know more about the environment

3398
02:07:01,900 --> 02:07:03,900
ok because of time

3399
02:07:03,900 --> 02:07:07,000
I think we can first thank Deputy Director Shen

3400
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,900
Then he will stay later

3401
02:07:08,900 --> 02:07:10,500
I have some personal questions to ask

3402
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:11,500
it's ok

3403
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:14,200
Okay, let's applaud him again and thank him.

3404
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:14,900
Thanks
