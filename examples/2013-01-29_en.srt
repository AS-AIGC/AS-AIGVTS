get a Ph.D.

23
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,520
1979 very early

24
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,800
1979

25
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,100
started teaching at National Taiwan University

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,280
He used to be the Director of Qi in the Information Department of National Taiwan University

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,140

00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,760
Dean of School of Electronics, National Taiwan University

30
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,340
Dr. Doge and his work in the United States

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,380
area of ​​expertise at the time was

32
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,920
satellite communication

33
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,240
When returning to China in 1979

34
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,300
Research resources at that time

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,580
still lacking

36
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,140
Then he decided to find a

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,920
with minimum cost

38
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,460
most common equipment

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,500
possible research directions

40
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,060
and start by reading a textbook

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,140
Try doing voice technology research

42
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,960
first in 1984

43
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,980
developed

44
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,540
Chinese Speech Synthesis Technology

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,640
And completed the first edition of Great Wisdom in 1991

46
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,200
Chinese Speech Recognition Technology

47
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,260
Let the Chinese computer can speak

48
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,800
Chinese Listening to Chinese

49
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,840
he in 1992

50
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
For Chinese computer

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,700
Contributions to input technology

52
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,540
Elected as IEEE Fellow

53
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,420
It is the fourth IEEE Fellow in Taiwan

54
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,320
I still remember 1994

55
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,480
When Dean Li returned to Taiwan

56
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,020
I will accompany Dean Li to the information center

57
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,160
As a result, Director Li Linshan showed off his Spirit No. 1

58
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:35,160
With his self-certified gun yuan's recitative input voice

59
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,460
Then display the voice in the computer

60
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,080
At that time the input was

61
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,580
Because his self-certification gun element is recitative

62
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,080
So it works great

63
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,580
I'm still very impressed

64
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,020
Then he also said that the computer can focus

65
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,760
After a person with an accent like me gets burnt

66
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
He can recognize my accent

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,680
very impressed

68
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,480
Then in 2010 with Chinese voice technology

69
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,480
and contributions to voice information search technology

70
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Elected ISDA Fellow of the International Phonetic Association

71
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,180
At that time, there were only about 30 ISDA Fellows in the world

72
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,980
including many linguists

73
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,180
those three asians

74
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,380
he is one of three asians

75
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,080
Of course in Taiwan in 1993

76
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,580
Academic Award from the Ministry of Education

77
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,680
Received a National Award from the Ministry of Education in 2004

78
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,380
So I'm very focused on doing research all the way.

79
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,880
Also did a lot of academic administrative services

80
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,580
shall we applaud

81
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,880
Welcome to Li Pingshan Newspaper Office

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Do you hear my voice? Hear it

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
OK, thank you Vice President Peng

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Then I am very glad to have this opportunity to come back to Academia Sinica

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
As he said, it's like going back to her mother's house

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
then i remember when i was here

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
There was a beautiful time more than ten years ago

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Then every plant and tree in Academia Sinica, bit by bit

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Lili is still in my heart, Xu Xurusheng

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I think Academia Sinica can be regarded as eternal

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
On the one hand, it is also a day and a month

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
it's nice to be back here

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thank you all for coming to today's speech

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Ok, so it's the first time I've seen such an advanced pointer

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
ok so let me try to use it

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I think it might be better if I use this so I don't have to face the computer

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No, I haven't used it, so let me try using

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,080
Everyone can take a look

99
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,120
today's speech topic

100
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,240
I know everyone

101
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,040
This sesame open the door

102
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,200
but you also

103
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,880
sorry i just can't use it

104
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,760
but you know me

105
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,680
not talking about the Arabian Nights

106
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,320
Not talking about Alibaba

107
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,200
I'm talking about the gates to treasures of knowledge

108
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,400
OK I'm talking about the door to the treasure trove of knowledge

109
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,960
So today's speech is mainly

110
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,560
these parts

111
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,400
then i will start by explaining

112
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,760
Speech signal and its analysis

113
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,760
and then i will

114
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,760
this

115
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,360
Explain how speech recognition works

116
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
Then enter today's topic

117
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,400
is the search for audio information

118
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,560
and finally

119
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,960
before the end

120
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,360
i will start by saying

121
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,400
i will start by saying

122
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
i will start by saying

123
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,320
and finally

124
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
before the end

125
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,280
I'll show you a few live demonstrations

126
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,680
Then I will divide this general knowledge

127
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
professional knowledge

128
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,760
and the three levels of language learning

129
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
come to show everyone

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,800
everybody look

131
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,600
I feel like this one moves more than I thought

132
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,500
Then maybe I'll use this

133
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,600
This step back a bit, I still use

134
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,200
I'd better use this

135
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,000
get used to it

136
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,600
ok then let's start

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,800
Everyone knows what I'm talking about today

138
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,900
then we understand that the network

139
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,300
It is already our daily life today

140
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,300
an indispensable part

141
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,400
All kinds of things are online

142
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,800
Then it's especially worth talking about

143
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
It should mean that we all understand

144
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,100
像Google, Amazon, Facebook, YouTube

145
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,500
These things provide our daily life

146
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,100
a lot of information

147
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,900
The other thing we can say is

148
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,600
Knowledge Warranty as we know it in the past

149
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,100
Like a library or a museum, etc.

150
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,000
It has been gradually virtualized or demonstrated

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,200
We are doing research today and looking for a paper

152
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,400
Few people have to go to the library to find

153
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,600
Because we found it on the Internet

154
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Similarly, online courses, distance learning, e-books, these

155
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,400
It has also become the most efficient learning tool.

156
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,900
in this situation

157
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,800
We can understand the only commonality of human beings today

158
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,400
Is Safeguarding Where Online?

159
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,700
if you think so

160
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,000
All knowledge becomes digital content

161
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,100
What is the most attractive form of digital content at this time?

162
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,600
We immediately thought of audio-visual multimedia

163
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,800
The reason we will understand immediately

164
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,600
Because of multimedia it can be colorful

165
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,400
can be colorful

166
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,300
Then its biggest feature is that it can be written without text

167
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,600
But it can have voice narration

168
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,800
The speech we speak is the sound signal of human language

169
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
then our voice

170
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,000
From this point of view

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,500
we will understand

172
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,700
Multimedia as long as it comes with voice narration

173
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,100
Usually it can describe digital content

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,400
theme concept

175
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,320
For example

176
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,680
when i listen to tv news

177
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,960
i can close my eyes

178
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,160
just listen to him

179
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,840
I already know the news he's talking about

180
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,320
I don't need to actually watch his picture

181
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,560
Of course you can watch

182
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,880
but i can ignore it

183
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,040
This means

184
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,480
The voice has been very clearly described

185
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,720
his multimedia content

186
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,880
so I can use it for digital content searches

187
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,520
On the other hand we also understand

188
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,720
Today's Web Searches

189
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,360
still text-based

190
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,520
Just like you enter a text when surfing the Internet

191
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,640
He is doing text comparison

192
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,920
So even if you're looking for a YouTube video

193
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,040
we will find him

194
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,920
Also because of whoever uploaded that video

195
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,160
while he is uploading

196
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,440
he wrote a bunch of words

197
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,200
Then we were looking for him based on text

198
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,560
This shows that today this part still has a very large space

199
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,000
not yet developed

200
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,120
Because on the one hand we also understand smartphones and devices

201
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Other possible Internet tools

202
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
what's there

203
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
we'll find out

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
For example, there can be various electronic devices in the car

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
At home, such as the living room and kitchen

206
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Can have various home appliances

207
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
There are also various accessories

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
e.g. glasses, watches

209
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
These may become the tools we use to surf the Internet

210
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Common features of these things

211
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
yes they can let us anytime, anywhere

212
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Connect with global knowledge and information

213
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
They also have a great feature

214
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's thin, short, and ubiquitous

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
can enter our daily life

216
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
use anytime, anywhere

217
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
i.e. personal computer

218
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
are no longer everyday information users

219
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
the only darling

220
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And this we found

221
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
under this environment

222
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What is the most convenient interface for surfing the Internet?

223
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
at least voice is one of them

224
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Why voice is one of them

225
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
at least the first

226
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
because it's just us talking

227
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
we can talk anytime anywhere

228
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So you can use it anytime, anywhere

229
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,760
Any of these tools we can talk to him

230
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,800
So any tool can be used

231
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,400
Talking is the most convenient and natural

232
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,560
Another point is that the voice is the most special

233
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
that is, it can be said in place

234
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,920
what is a sentence in place

235
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,320
Let's say I'm looking for the US presidential election

236
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,320
I'd say the US presidential election is already in place

237
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,600
Any touch other than voice

238
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,080
It is impossible to press a button in one sentence

239
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,720
So Voice Has Its Benefits

240
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,400
So you can imagine

241
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,760
what am i talking about here

242
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
This is our future online world

243
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,560
or today's online world

244
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,360
in our digital content

245
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,880
or knowledge

246
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,160
there are a bunch of text

247
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,680
There are a bunch of multimedia

248
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,840
this will be more and more

249
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,800
then we can still search with today's text

250
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,680
go find these things

251
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,640
as long as it has words written on it

252
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,640
But we can also search directly by voice

253
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,520
At this time, I can directly use

254
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,240
this smart phone

255
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,440
or similar handheld interface

256
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,760
Then I go directly to voice with voice

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,400
I can find his things based on the content of his voice

258
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,200
If I find the text

259
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,200
I can also use listening to ask him to synthesize it for me, etc.

260
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,800
that's what we're going to talk about today

261
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,000
In other words, although today's Internet interface is this

262
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,800
It's text, you go find the text

263
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,200
But everything that can be done with words can be done with voice

264
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,600
So we would expect that it should be possible to do these things with voice

265
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Of course, we also know that there are many interactions on the Internet today.

266
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,600
which means we lost something

267
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
net give me something

268
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
have some interaction

269
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,200
This interaction is a dialogue of sound in terms of Silver

270
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,800
That can go a step further and be multimodal

271
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Which means I might still be using touch

272
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,200
There are also some keys

273
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,600
then become a multimodal conversation

274
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,800
That's what we're going to talk about today

275
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,000
That is, we can use voice commands

276
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,800
through hand-held electronic devices

277
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,600
Then on the one hand, with the help of multimedia digital content

278
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,840
All with some voice narration to browse and search for information using the web

279
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,600
In a simple sentence

280
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,440
This means that what we are talking about is the voice version of Google-related technologies

281
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,160
That gets in simpler terms

282
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,440
It's voice unlimited Internet access

283
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,760
that's what i'm going to talk about today

284
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,720
ok so how about the beginning

285
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,960
Let's show you first

286
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,520
What does the sound signal look like

287
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,280
how we analyze it

288
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,080
Everyone knows that sound is sound waves in the air

289
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,960
we can use a microphone

290
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,120
turn it into an electrical signal

291
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,720
The signal of electricity is the cold and heat of a time

292
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,040
like this

293
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,080
This time we go further

294
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,320
Convert the electrical signal into a pile of hours and enter it into the computer

295
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,240
For example

296
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,960
This short signal is actually a point

297
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
one point

298
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,360
one point

299
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,000
one point

300
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,240
Then I will turn these points into hours

301
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,240
The computer can handle the time

302
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,680
This is what we call a voice signal

303
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,800
what does it look like

304
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,040
us

305
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Let's look at a few examples

306
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,640
For example, this is an example of some vowels

307
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,840
You can see, for example, this is E

308
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,400
this is R etc.

309
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,640
You immediately find that it has a common characteristic

310
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,760
That is, they are all cyclical

311
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,520
Then this cycle is the so-called pitch

312
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,720
Jizhou

313
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,840
Jizhou said it has a very clear physical meaning

314
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,160
is its inverse

315
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,640
It is what we call F0

316
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,000
is the pitch that our ears hear

317
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,320
So the immediate thing that comes to mind is

318
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,960
our four voices

319
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,040
You guys know our fourth sound like R

320
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,520
This pitch is slowly falling

321
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,760
As time goes on

322
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,640
The horizontal axis is time

323
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,480
what does this mean

324
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,760
I'm the one who posted the music R

325
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,560
its cycle

326
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,360
move forward

327
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,560
It cycle becomes bigger and bigger

328
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,640
So the pitch gets lower and lower

329
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,480
Then it becomes R

330
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
if i pronounce

331
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,520
This cycle is getting shorter and shorter

332
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,760
getting shorter

333
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,920
it climbs up

334
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,920
that's the second sound wait

335
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,920
We call this voice Joy in Voice

336
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,320
There are many purple sounds that look like this

337
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,840
this is a purple sound

338
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,200
sandwiched between two periodic vowels

339
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,040
It has no cycles at all and is like a bunch of noise

340
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,240
We call it Qingyin unvoiced

341
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,280
Of course Ziyin is not exactly Qingyin

342
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,600
There are also like this purple tone is v

343
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,920
It is also sandwiched between two periodic vowels

344
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,480
But it's also clearly cyclical

345
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,360
Like this Violet v it's still scorching

346
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,680
if you understand this

347
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,360
Let's look at the signal length of a sentence

348
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,440
like this

349
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,280
this is a sentence

350
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,360
Our total length is 0.1 seconds

351
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,280
Then there are a total of eight segments of 0.8 seconds

352
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,680
This sentence is should we chase

353
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,120
you will see the first

354
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,000
This is Qingyin

355
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,840
it's out of cycle

356
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,360
this is un

357
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,760
It is clear that there is a cycle, etc.

358
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,720
This is a light tone, there is no period

359
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,720
This A is clearly periodic, etc.

360
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,080
That's our signal

361
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,720
How do we analyze such a signal

362
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,520
Of course, there are many ways to analyze

363
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,480
However, one of the most basic methods of analyzing signals

364
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,400
is to analyze its frequency

365
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Then analyze the frequency

366
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,760
then the simplest idea

367
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,520
I think it can be explained like this

368
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,480
It seems that in the phasor of the three-dimensional space that we are very familiar with

369
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,680
A phasor I can use three mutually perpendicular bases

370
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,040
Ijk spread it out

371
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,720
The three phasors

372
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,600
Each of the three perpendicular bases has a component

373
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,760
is the ADC

374
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,560
So I can write like this

375
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,760
Of course, these three bases don't have to be like that.

376
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,360
we can move it

377
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,960
like turn it around

378
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,480
if a turn

379
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,360
This Ijk is converted into iProng JProng KProng

380
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,840
when i turn like this

381
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,120
My weight has also changed

382
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,960
Although my phasor

383
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,200
is the same as A

384
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,800
Then such a conversion relationship

385
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,600
In fact, we analyze the frequency

386
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,440
this

387
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,200
This Fuji conversion is exactly the same thing

388
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,600
It's just a sign we're thinking now

389
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,900
is very big

390
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,400
it spreads out across the timeline

391
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:16,900
Therefore

392
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,500
it's on this T1T2T3

393
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,300
have these values

394
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,200
as if on these bases

395
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,800
There are these components that are the same

396
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,500
So why?

397
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,900
When we do a Fuji conversion

398
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,100
expand this signal to

399
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,000
When this frequency goes up

400
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,100
I'm on every now

401
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,100
This converts every

402
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,100
every point becomes a frequency

403
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,000
In other words, a cos has different frequencies

404
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,100
Then there are these values

405
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,000
that means like

406
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,500
I call it these

407
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,600
After turning these bases around

408
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
I regain the weight

409
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,300
So what this says above is

410
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,600
in this signal

411
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,500
components of each frequency

412
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,700
how much each

413
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,900
Then we call this frequency

414
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,500
relatively

415
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,100
this one just now

416
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,900
is the so-called real

417
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,720
With this understanding

418
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,840
let's go back now

419
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,440
I want to analyze the sentence just now

420
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,240
what to do

421
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,040
you can imagine my signal

422
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,320
always changing

423
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,920
For example, here is

424
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,840
looks like this

425
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,880
here is

426
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,560
A looks like this

427
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,000
how do i analyze it

428
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,760
I have to analyze it piece by piece

429
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,600
I can analyze this short paragraph

430
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,760
this frequency

431
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,360
I can analyze this short paragraph

432
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,720
frequency of A etc.

433
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,480
So what we can do

434
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,840
just put this signal

435
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,400
Take a small piece and a small piece to do it separately

436
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,760
Fuji conversion

437
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,280
Each converted result

438
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
I draw it as a line

439
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,440
use its black and white or color

440
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,520
to show its height

441
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,960
as if it was like this one by one

442
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,760
because every conversion

443
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,360
Actually it's like this

444
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,120
graph at this frequency

445
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,840
then i am actually

446
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,320
A lot of these pictures are lined up here

447
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,880
I just use the color for its height

448
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,160
or in black and white

449
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,440
become like this

450
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,000
that kind of

451
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,320
Two-dimensional graph becomes a two-dimensional graph

452
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,360
This horizontal axis is the original time

453
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,120
same time as this time

454
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,840
and the vertical axis becomes frequency

455
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,560
So it is a two-dimensional graph

456
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,880
We call it spectrogram

457
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,400
maybe a food chart

458
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,040
we can give an example

459
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,080
use just right

460
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,640
There's one more thing

461
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,000
there's some really high places on this

462
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,600
The components of these frequencies are particularly large

463
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
These are the times when we speak

464
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,000
inside our mouth

465
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,600
some frequencies of vocal resonance

466
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,280
after having this

467
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,720
Let's look back at that sentence now

468
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,920
that sentence

469
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,680
we just said

470
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,840
This is the total sentence from the beginning to the end

471
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,160
Then each segment is 0.1 seconds

472
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,840
I'm redrawing it now

473
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,360
put this horizontal axis

474
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,320
compress it into a paragraph

475
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,120
from here to here

476
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,680
That's what I just said

477
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,040
So this sentence is still should we chase

478
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,160
But I'll pull up the heavy shaft first

479
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,040
So the picture just now becomes here

480
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,600
So this is the signal on the timeline

481
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,300
just an axis flag

482
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,600
Between the two lines is an axis flag.

483
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
It's packed into a pile.

484
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,600
I draw the same timeline here

485
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,400
The upper axis is my frequency

486
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,000
The picture above is my time spectrum

487
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,400
we can see

488
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
For example, this is

489
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,100
Its time signal looks like this

490
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,400
Its frequency is like this

491
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,000
this is a thing

492
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,200
things like this

493
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,100
it has axis flags

494
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,300
Here things just become like this and so on

495
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,300
This is what we use time spectrum to analyze

496
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,200
What about another step?

497
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,400
we just said

498
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,800
the top of these parts

499
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
is the resonance frequency

500
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,300
is that each point has a value

501
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,400
then i can connect it

502
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,100
this is an area

503
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,500
If I draw this

504
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,400
just this example

505
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,100
you can see

506
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,800
This is another word

507
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,100
but

508
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,500
Below mine is the signal on its timeline

509
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,200
Above is its time spectrum

510
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,100
Then I can actually take these four resonant frequencies

511
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,300
Draw four curves

512
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,800
Then we can see that at these frequencies

513
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,200
is the resonance frequency

514
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,500
And it with each tone of time

515
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,300
this sentence is this sentence

516
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,800
The resonant frequency of each sound is changing

517
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,000
Okay, what I just told you is

518
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
voice on paper

519
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,500
Below we show you a real voice

520
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,300
this is a sentence

521
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,500
we can first hear what it is

522
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
This bus does not arrive at National Taiwan University

523
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,800
That's what's underneath

524
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,000
The bottom piece is what we just saw

525
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
signal unfolded in time

526
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,700
That piece in the middle is what we just saw

527
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,000
food recipes

528
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,500
we see every note of it

529
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,800
what it looks like in frequency

530
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,200
What about the distribution of its different frequencies

531
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,800
Then these four four color curves

532
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,200
is its four resonant frequencies

533
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,000
that's up there

534
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,200
is the reciprocal of its period

535
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,840
that is pitch

536
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,600
You see that this bus can't arrive

537
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,440
You can see that this is less than

538
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,040
This is the fourth sound

539
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,800
The second one will arrive more smoothly and so on.

540
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,840
This is Taiwan, this is a university, etc.

541
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,240
we can listen again

542
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,640
This bus does not arrive at National Taiwan University

543
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,140
We can also give an example

544
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,340
For example, let's see, for example, what is the sound here?

545
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,740
and

546
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,940
about sound

547
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,340
if here to here

548
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:45,540
The next thing is to learn

549
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,340
you know what it is from here to here

550
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,740
Taiwan

551
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,540
OK

552
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:56,340
What I want to show you is this Tao

553
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,940
It doesn't look like this way

554
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,320
Because of the call behind this

555
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,720
so it's already you heard it's going to dial

556
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,880
What about this way?

557
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,080
What if you look inside

558
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,960
kind of like

559
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,280
Looking at its spectrum, it looks a bit like

560
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,600
You can see that the pitch is also much different

561
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,160
What about this description?

562
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,840
even in the same sentence

563
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,760
The same person speaks two identical sounds

564
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,040
is very different

565
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,880
we can pull it out a bit

566
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,000
for example

567
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
this is less than

568
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
What if I pull it out to a certain extent?

569
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
you can see its cycle

570
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
This cycle is very clear

571
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Then there is a lot of difference between the two before and after.

572
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
etc.

573
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
good

574
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The above passage is for you to understand

575
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
what sound do we see

576
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
good

577
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
What I want to tell you next is

578
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
How do we let machines recognize human voices

579
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
then we immediately

580
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,560
The voice recognition that comes to mind on the Internet seems to be like this

581
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,840
this is a sound

582
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,560
today's weather is very good

583
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,760
For example, a short period of time is a lot of hours

584
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,600
I got these answers by general calculus

585
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
But the basement is not so easy

586
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,120
because you immediately understand

587
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,360
Each of our sounds has many phonetic characters

588
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,520
Just based on what sounds these are

589
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,000
You immediately think why this is not the gene of gold

590
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Why isn't this the day of the meal?

591
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,560
Of course because we all know when we hear

592
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,080
why do people know

593
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,440
because we know the context

594
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,200
We also know these words in our heads

595
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,120
So what a machine is going to do must also do these things

596
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,320
That is, we need to put all kinds of language knowledge into the computer.

597
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,600
At least one of these is a dictionary

598
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,160
one is grammar

599
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,880
The dictionary told me that it is connected with this sound

600
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,280
there is a word called today

601
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,120
Grammar tells me that this word goes with this word

602
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
can become a phrase etc.

603
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,580
We humans actually know based on this

604
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,080
this is not gold

605
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,080
this is not heaven

606
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
The same computer has something like this

607
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Therefore we need to take this knowledge

608
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,080
integrated with these signals

609
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,080
that's what we're going to say

610
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,080
how to do this

611
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,080
So let's start with the basics

612
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,080
sound signal

613
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,080
Divided into different patterns to see

614
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
For example

615
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,160
Let's say I want to recognize 10 sounds from 0 to 9

616
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,160
position sound comes in

617
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,160
My first step is to take its features

618
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,160
then the characteristic is

619
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,160
bunch of numbers

620
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,160
wrap it up as a quantity

621
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,160
then follow the signal

622
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,160
I measure each item one by one

623
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
become a line of items

624
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,160
sequence of items

625
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,160
This sequence of items represents the sound

626
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,160
Then I went to compare with the model

627
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,160
to make a decision

628
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,160
what is the model

629
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,240
Then if we recognize 10 sounds from 0 to 9

630
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,280
I want 10 models

631
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,800
There is a model for each sound

632
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,400
They were also trained on known sounds, respectively.

633
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,960
So the spirit model has to tell him these things

634
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,480
These voices are spirit

635
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,560
He uses their extracted feature sequence

636
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,880
To train the stored model

637
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,920
Then do this comparison

638
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,000
So here we have to explain

639
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,280
why feature

640
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,120
Once upon a time, my father, Sun Yuan, had a very good analogy

641
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,400
He said I saw a man on the road

642
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,440
I want to judge whether he is a man or a woman

643
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,000
I just look at his hair and his clothes

644
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,040
89 ignore 10

645
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,360
Occasionally make a mistake

646
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,440
That hair and clothes are characteristic

647
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,240
if i take a photo

648
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,040
Capture every bit of black and white

649
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,240
then count

650
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,360
I can't tell if he's a man or a woman

651
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,160
But I knew it when I saw the clothes

652
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,440
the same reason

653
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,360
We want the feature to be the same

654
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,520
You see how complicated it was just taught

655
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,200
The same path looks completely different

656
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,480
i can't rely on that

657
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,760
I want to grab features

658
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So what is this characteristic?

659
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,600
Let's take another example

660
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,240
We are actually like what we just said

661
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,560
the signal is here

662
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,360
Let me take this paragraph as an example, there are 512 points here

663
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,320
I do a calculation to get a series of numbers

664
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,600
Arrange it into an item called O1

665
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,920
I'll move this over later

666
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,760
Calculate these 512 points and get another item

667
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,160
get these numbers too

668
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,760
Get the second quantity called O2 O3 and so on

669
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,680
The signal then becomes a row of terms

670
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,440
This is what we call the eigenvalue

671
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,880
What's in it is not easy to explain here

672
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,360
but think of it this way

673
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,080
first we know

674
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,480
scientists have long understood

675
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,760
The human ear listens to the sound is to listen to the frequency

676
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,920
And listen to the frequency

677
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,840
Then we do the same here

678
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:54,360
That is to capture the signal in each frequency band

679
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,840
The second we also know

680
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,920
The sound we make is R or U or G or T

681
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,160
because of our accent

682
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,260
different shape

683
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,460
So the pure-tooth relationship is very important

684
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,160
In fact, we refer to these relations

685
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,260
only possible in these numbers

686
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,660
So how big is this phasor?

687
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,860
actually quite big

688
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,700
Basically about 39 is about

689
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,160
is a very long, large phasor

690
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,860
Okay, with this understanding

691
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,620
We probably know how these phasors come from

692
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,260
So the next question is what are these models like?

693
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,100
then let's briefly explain

694
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,300
What is a model?

695
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,960
There are many models today

696
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,700
But the most commonly used and generally successful

697
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,760
The so-called Hidden Markov Model

698
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,560
Headed Mark Model

699
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,260
Then let's explain this model in very simple language

700
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,560
It is a series of states of sound

701
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,360
string it up

702
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,060
For example

703
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,600
If I want to recognize 10 sounds from 0 to 9

704
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,860
Then 0 has a model of 0

705
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,420
1 in 1 model

706
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,100
For example

707
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,960
Assuming this is a model of 6

708
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,820
When I make the sound of 6

709
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,960
obviously

710
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,400
The signal is preceded by a change of le

711
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,800
middle may be e

712
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,000
may be followed by o

713
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,120
We tried the signal keeps changing

714
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,960
From 6 to 6 state

715
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,000
to describe the different sounds

716
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,760
what are these

717
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,840
These are the feature quantities we just mentioned.

718
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,120
You remember we have O1 O2 O3 here

719
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,560
are my feature quantities

720
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,800
then you can imagine

721
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,040
maybe my front

722
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,000
What about the three O12 O3?

723
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,800
is to describe the sound of this e

724
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,360
Then 4567 may be the case of 2

725
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,160
8 could be 3 and so on

726
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,360
but you can understand right away

727
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,560
It's okay when we send 6

728
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,560
6 can also be 6

729
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
Can be long or short

730
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,720
Each sound in the middle can be long or short

731
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,560
So actually you can imagine

732
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,880
Every state here

733
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,440
It can also be long or short

734
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,520
So how to describe this phenomenon that can be long or short?

735
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,480
Then we will use probability to illustrate it

736
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,880
So for example

737
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,000
we will have

738
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
This means that if the previous O1 is in 1

739
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
The probability that the next O2 is still in 1

740
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,500
And this is the O3 in front of me in 1

741
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,000
But the probability of the next O4 reaching 2, etc.

742
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
what is this for

743
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
This is what we call the state transition probability

744
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
In other words let's take for example

745
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Suppose this is 0.1

746
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
If this is 0.9

747
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I mean if I'm O3 it's 1

748
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
What about O4?

749
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
9 Chengdu is 2

750
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
That is to say, I am in 1

751
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
1 to 1 becomes 2

752
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Because it pops up 90% of the time

753
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So 1 must be very short

754
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Conversely

755
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
if this is 0.9

756
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
What if this is 0.1?

757
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
that means say

758
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
What if O1 is 1

759
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Then O28 is still 1

760
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
90% or 1

761
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
This is still 1

762
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
This is still 1

763
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,440
You can imagine that it takes about 9 times for 1 to become 2 and so on

764
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,800
tell me these odds

765
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,400
How can they be long or short

766
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,200
But these are just chances

767
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,600
not necessarily

768
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,760
they are all random

769
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,200
can be changed

770
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,200
they don't have a certain value

771
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
on the other hand

772
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,480
Suppose I know that O1 is inside 1

773
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,560
Do I know what the phasor length of O1 is?

774
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,040
i don't know

775
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,040
Let's take the inside of O1 just now

776
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,000
For example, the X1 in O1

777
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,600
this is a value

778
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,800
what will happen to it

779
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,280
What about the X1?

780
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,080
it can be like this

781
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,640
means that it can be this value

782
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,280
also this value

783
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,800
also this value

784
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,280
also this value

785
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,080
It will be all right

786
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,840
just the odds are different

787
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,600
This is a probability distribution

788
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,840
In other words we completely

789
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,840
Even if O1 is in 1

790
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,200
I have absolutely no idea how much the X1 will be

791
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,080
i just let it

792
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,520
It has different values

793
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,000
Both may be high or low

794
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,800
It's more likely to see this here

795
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,960
This chance is relatively small

796
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,400
that is it

797
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,960
what if it's in 2 or 3

798
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,920
also the same

799
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,240
but each value can

800
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,880
The distribution of the probability of its value is just different

801
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,000
This shows how diverse our signals are

802
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,200
very varied

803
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,400
like you just saw

804
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,000
same two to less than two to

805
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,040
it's just different

806
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,640
then in this case

807
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,160
in each state

808
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,920
Each value can have this many probability distributions

809
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,680
what to do

810
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,720
What we usually do is

811
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,000
Approach it with a high wire probability

812
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,800
you may understand

813
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,520
Kose is a most standard probability model

814
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,600
We just give it an average

815
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,960
with its fatness

816
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,640
it has to be like that

817
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,560
So no matter how long this

818
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:57,080
I can even get close to it with a Kose

819
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,360
What about this way?

820
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,120
I get a say 6

821
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
6 models

822
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,400
There are a lot of parameters in this model

823
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,200
For example, these probabilities

824
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Gauss's and so on

825
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
These parameters are all trainable

826
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,500
I just need to give the machine enough 666666

827
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,900
tell it it's 6 words

828
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,200
I can get all these papers of these 6 models

829
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,900
when i have another voice called 6

830
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,000
I throw its phasor in

831
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,400
can count its chances

832
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,400
The probability of 6 should be high and so on

833
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,400
This is the model we are talking about

834
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,200
Well, what I just said is limited to

835
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,700
Suppose I recognize only 10 tones from 0 to 9

836
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,000
that is easier

837
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,600
What we really want to recognize is the continuous speech of great wisdom

838
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,700
What is the so-called great wisdom?

839
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,100
Do you know the commonly used words in Chinese?

840
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,200
We can probably assume 60,000

841
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,600
Then there are about 60,000 common words in English.

842
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,000
So, in any of my random sounds

843
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,900
does it belong to a certain word

844
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,300
It has 60,000

845
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,800
Then they talked consecutively

846
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,920
In a word, you don't know it is

847
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,800
How many words are there in the middle?

848
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,720
I don't know where it's disconnected in the middle

849
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,240
how do i deal with this problem

850
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,800
you can imagine

851
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,200
suppose my voice comes in

852
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,800
Like I just did it's feature

853
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,680
Phasor After getting a series of phasors

854
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,720
Suppose the voice is the sentence

855
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,120
This is a speech

856
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,520
how can i tell it apart

857
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,000
The first point is that I try to find a way

858
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,160
since this is english

859
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,880
I took all the possible basic sounds of English

860
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,680
find out

861
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,520
There may be around 40 basic sounds in English

862
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,320
So I took these basic notes

863
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,000
Create one for each basic tone

864
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,520
The model just mentioned

865
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
The model formed by these basic sounds

866
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,720
is what we call an acoustic model

867
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,160
For example, in this sentence

868
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,200
These are the basic sounds spelled out

869
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,400
So therefore we want my acoustic model

870
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,640
can tell me

871
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,600
In this sound are these basic tones

872
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
In fact, what we do is far more complicated than this

873
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,240
Because we found that the basic tone

874
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,840
not just one model

875
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,960
as long as the front is different

876
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,760
The back is different

877
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,080
it's just different

878
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,760
Did we just see that

879
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,200
The way ahead is different from the way behind

880
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,000
because of that way

881
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,080
It will be different if there is one behind the front road.

882
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,400
So we actually want to see the difference between the front and the back

883
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,360
are different

884
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,640
So we're using what's called a triple-sonic

885
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,760
Tri-Fone

886
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,680
Suppose there are 40 basic sounds in English

887
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,160
how many models do i need

888
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,920
40 to the third power so many kinds

889
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,920
assuming i know the sounds

890
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,920
This time I can use a dictionary

891
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,920
The dictionary told me that the spelling of these sounds is this word

892
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,320
The spelling of these sounds is this word

893
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
etc.

894
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,080
so i can get the answer

895
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,480
the answer is not

896
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,480
We know that this world is inferior to consciousness ten to eighty-nine

897
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,720
why

898
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,400
because you can immediately imagine

899
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,160
How similar is this sound to this sound

900
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,520
How similar is this sound to this sound

901
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,360
How similar is this sound to this sound

902
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,920
If we let our ears distinguish

903
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,440
It's not easy to tell, right?

904
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
It is more difficult for machines to distinguish between

905
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,000
So the machine can only tell me

906
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,160
The sound is probably this

907
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,800
probably this

908
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,760
probably this

909
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,600
each with a score

910
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,160
Then the highest score

911
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,800
that's right

912
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,200
not necessarily

913
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,640
So after getting a bunch of tones

914
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,100
Can spell out many miraculous words

915
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,120
then what should we do

916
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,800
Then we need to have a

917
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,480
so-called language model

918
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,880
he told me

919
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,200
In fact, only these three words together

920
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,480
is the most smooth sentence

921
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,520
why

922
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,680
he can count

923
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,160
The word appears in

924
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,480
Chances of giant hands

925
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,960
then after the word

926
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,360
The probability of receiving this word

927
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,520
then these two words

928
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,680
The probability of following this word, etc.

929
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,920
multiply them all

930
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,480
is the probability of this sentence

931
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,480
If the probability of the sentence is high

932
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,120
I feel like saying

933
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,480
This is relatively smooth

934
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,020
So these are what we call language models

935
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,980
For example

936
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,960
This is the probability that two words are connected

937
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,880
double grammar

938
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,460
This is the probability of connecting three words

939
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,160
the first two

940
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,260
I will take this chance later

941
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,000
what we call triplicate grammars etc.

942
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,720
What about these language models?

943
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,160
Of course how did it come about?

944
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,120
I can use a text database

945
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,160
For example, if you go online, you can capture a database of 10 million words.

946
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,000
to count the odds

947
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,600
I can work out the odds

948
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
These probabilities are called language models

949
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,720
what about after this

950
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,720
This time I have a better way to string the sounds together

951
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,560
I have a better way of knowing what it is

952
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,560
what's the matter

953
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,400
So what about the language model just now?

954
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,680
I use the example below

955
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,880
Maybe it's easier for Chinese people to imagine

956
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,280
here is a sentence

957
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,680
This sentence is called

958
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,280
Two people in Taitung are missing

959
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,280
This is a sentence from the TV news

960
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
but what?

961
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
Because many sounds are similar

962
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,080
I can spell a lot of weird words in no time

963
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,080
strange word come

964
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,080
For example, say Haoyu

965
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,280
It seems to be temple language

966
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,680
Also like pottery

967
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
so constantly

968
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,280
also looks like gratuitous

969
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,080
What about Taitung?

970
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
much like too much wait

971
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,080
So many possible words can be spelled out

972
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,080
We draw it into a graph called a word graph

973
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,640
The horizontal axis in this graph is time.

974
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,600
any line is some possible word

975
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,000
between two points

976
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,120
Our vertical axis has no special meaning

977
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,360
just connect all the words in there

978
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,160
Each path here is a possible answer

979
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,120
We need to know that there is only this

980
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,520
is the correct answer

981
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,600
nothing else is right

982
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,760
That's the role of the language model

983
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,200
We want him to figure it out and tell me

984
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,600
The two missing in Taitung

985
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,800
The odds are much higher than this

986
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,400
What escape is too heavy for no reason, etc.

987
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,160
Then this is the function we just talked about

988
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,240
Then this needs to be trained with a text database.

989
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,760
Then this needs to use the sound database for training, etc.

990
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,080
Well, after understanding this

991
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,800
then we need to know the next thing

992
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,040
then you can notice all my arrows now

993
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,600
We all know this is coming

994
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,280
what is this doing

995
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,360
He has a lot to do

996
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,480
He took all the items in

997
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,160
He also put this acoustic model

998
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,800
take the words in

999
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,800
All languages ​​are included

1000
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,600
Other profitable export complaints

1001
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,400
This man is very powerful

1002
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,700
This person is called a language model

1003
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,760
language decoding

1004
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,540
what is he doing

1005
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,600
We use the following figure to explain

1006
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,120
first thing is

1007
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,160
We're going to point the word now

1008
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,200
build a number

1009
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,480
word points

1010
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,760
What's the meaning

1011
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,780
for example

1012
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,880
s followed by a is called s

1013
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,860
it's a word

1014
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,160
s followed by e

1015
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,440
This is speak

1016
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,460
it's a word

1017
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,000
Here connect ch to speak

1018
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,040
it's a word blah blah

1019
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,860
I assume that there are 60,000 common English words

1020
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,160
My side is 60,000 words connected here

1021
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,960
become a tree

1022
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,000
any line on a tree

1023
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,540
or a jug

1024
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,100
is a Hidden Markov Model

1025
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,640
Because it's all a model

1026
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,200
When you go to the end of every road is a word

1027
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,220
or a word

1028
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,020
what we call a leaf

1029
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,800
a leaf on a tree

1030
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,080
So what?

1031
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,640
I give us any voice

1032
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,000
I'll start here

1033
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Go all the way down to calculate the score for each path

1034
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So where does this score go

1035
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I knew the signal here

1036
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
is say what is the score

1037
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
What is the score of the speech when you come here, etc.

1038
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Then why should I be a tree?

1039
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
That's because only in this way

1040
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I can use the same unit without double counting

1041
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
For example, this speak and speech

1042
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
The road ahead is a good score

1043
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
only the end here is different

1044
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
get two points etc.

1045
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
After this we have to understand

1046
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I don't know the score of a word until I finish walking

1047
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
That's because I'm a continuous voice

1048
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So a word is followed by all possible words

1049
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
so what will it be

1050
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
will be like this

1051
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
The end of each word is connected to the next tree

1052
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
So let's say this has 60,000 common words

1053
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Go to the end after every word

1054
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Just start picking the next tree

1055
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
The tree has 60,000 leaves

1056
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Go to the bottom and pick up the next tree, etc.

1057
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So this is a primeval forest expanded by word point trees

1058
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
There are thousands of numbers in it

1059
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Then I'm going to find the answer in it

1060
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Then this is what we have to do in the language code block just now.

1061
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Okay, this probably explains how we recognize human voices.

1062
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Next, I will talk about Chinese speech technology

1063
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Why is it the same as Western languages?

1064
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
That's because our Chinese language structure is very special

1065
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
What about the first one?

1066
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
every word has its meaning

1067
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And what we really mean by a sentence are words, not characters.

1068
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
What does the word mean, and what does the word mean?

1069
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
sometimes relevant and sometimes irrelevant

1070
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
For example, our small bookstore is a store that sells books.

1071
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
This means directly related

1072
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
University is not a big study

1073
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But he has something to do with university and school.

1074
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
What about the bachelor? It's not a glowing stick.

1075
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But he probably has something to do with light and stick

1076
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
a little bit less

1077
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,280
Does the wind follow the flow?

1078
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,800
it's harder to say

1079
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,360
so different words

1080
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,680
It has a complex relationship with the meaning of the word

1081
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,960
so i see a word

1082
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,240
or hear a word

1083
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,520
What exactly does that mean

1084
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,080
This is quite complicated

1085
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,160
Furthermore, our Chinese words have no boundaries

1086
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,680
in the sentence

1087
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,020
And even the definition of the word is not clear

1088
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,060
For example, in this sentence

1089
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,080
everyone see

1090
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,120
computer is a word

1091
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,140
technology is a word

1092
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,160
is a word

1093
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,180
tech is a word

1094
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,460
computer technology is a word

1095
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,020
computer technology is also a word

1096
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,560
which word is a word

1097
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,320
actually

1098
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,860
definition is ambiguous

1099
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,680
The words in everyone's mind are different

1100
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,520
Furthermore, many of our small words can be connected in series at will

1101
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,540
become a big word

1102
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:47,100
For example, the terrorist attack in New York

1103
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,920
Our long words can be arbitrarily shortened into short words

1104
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,980
For example, Taiwan University has become too big

1105
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,760
Then what

1106
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,800
some words can be split

1107
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,580
For example, Lee Teng-hui becomes former President Lee Teng-hui

1108
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,100
Then what

1109
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,540
You can take a bath and take a comfortable big bath

1110
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,160
Everyone should understand that a bath is not a thing

1111
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,120
So instead of washing an apple

1112
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,400
this is a bath

1113
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,960
But this bath can be taken apart

1114
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,080
etc.

1115
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,560
Therefore, each of our words is independent and interesting like this

1116
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,960
So new words are generated automatically every day

1117
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,800
For example, gasoline and electric palms

1118
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,960
this is the new word

1119
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,640
We don't need to define what it is

1120
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,720
Everyone knows

1121
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,760
etc.

1122
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:28,840
Top too wind

1123
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,400
word everyone knows this time

1124
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,440
But will they be in the dictionary

1125
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,720
80% of them are not in the dictionary

1126
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,280
Therefore our words are infinite

1127
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,440
We are unlikely to be inside a dictionary

1128
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,240
contains all the words

1129
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,680
Did you notice when I just said

1130
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,800
There must be a dictionary in this method

1131
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,960
But Chinese dictionaries are difficult to make

1132
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,280
the second

1133
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,760
We also have a very special structure

1134
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,720
That is, we are word for word

1135
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,080
every word has a sound

1136
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,240
But the number of sounds is very small

1137
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,120
Everyone knows our Chinese

1138
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
The total number of sounds is about 1300

1139
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,400
We have at least 80,000 commonly used characters

1140
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,800
More than 8000

1141
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,200
Therefore, each sound can have many phonetic characters

1142
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,600
have different meanings

1143
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,600
so you hear a voice

1144
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,000
don't know what word it is

1145
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,200
then another point

1146
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,600
we are tonal language

1147
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,200
I just said it

1148
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,800
so different tones give me different words

1149
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,200
different meaning

1150
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,000
Let's take an example

1151
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
you will understand immediately

1152
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,400
For example, the two sounds of one and ten

1153
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,400
They all have four tones and many homophonic characters.

1154
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,400
We can make up a lot of words with unison

1155
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,400
For example

1156
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,400
Here is a time, a time, a time, a time, a time

1157
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,600
In fact, there are many, many

1158
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,600
I just give these few examples

1159
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,400
you will understand

1160
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,400
if i don't know its tone

1161
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,800
It's really hard for me to know what it's talking about

1162
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,200
Furthermore

1163
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,800
we have different voices

1164
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,200
can form a myriad of words

1165
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,000
so our voice

1166
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Grasp the sound inside from the sound

1167
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
his difficulty is

1168
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
quite high

1169
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
We actually have many words with the same pronunciation

1170
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
You may never have felt

1171
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Because we don't have to worry about it when we talk

1172
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
For example

1173
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
The intersection of Research Institute Road and Zhongxiao East Road

1174
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Then of course what I'm talking about is this intersecting

1175
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
You don't have to expect that intersection

1176
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
etc.

1177
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
This is what we humans can do

1178
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
machine you have to let the machine know

1179
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
That is to say, our few limited tones

1180
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Carries extremely rich linguistic messages

1181
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Then the hierarchical language unit of sound is Western language

1182
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
pinyin but not in the language

1183
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Again, the order of our words in the play

1184
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
is quite free

1185
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
give an example

1186
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
these few words

1187
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I'm leaving at 6:30 tomorrow morning

1188
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
These words form a sentence

1189
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I mean everyone will understand right away

1190
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
but you know

1191
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
How many ways are there?

1192
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
at least these

1193
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I can be 6:30 tomorrow morning

1194
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,200
i want to go

1195
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,560
Or I will leave at 6:30 tomorrow morning

1196
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,480
or wait and wait

1197
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,280
So why?

1198
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,040
Use Mandarin voice to search Chinese information

1199
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,600
what kind of problems

1200
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,760
then you can immediately think of

1201
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,840
The first is because the information network is alive

1202
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,360
Chinese thoughts keep appearing every day

1203
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,440
And the mind is not in the dictionary

1204
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,640
is difficult

1205
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,240
But what we are looking for is often heart words

1206
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,480
those are our keywords

1207
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:31,880
For example

1208
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,200
I want to order the top Taifeng Xiehuang Xiaolongbao

1209
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,080
It is quite possible that the Internet is going to say that

1210
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,280
But this thing is not in the dictionary

1211
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,920
This thing is not in the dictionary

1212
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,560
Can you catch it just based on these sounds?

1213
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,960
Wait these are examples of this

1214
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,840
Typhoon Nali

1215
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,840
Definitely not in the dictionary

1216
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,720
But the keyword you want is this

1217
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,880
these are keywords

1218
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,360
Words in user commands and target information

1219
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,520
often inconsistent

1220
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,600
for example

1221
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,000
So say I'm looking for

1222
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,500
North Second High Road Conditions

1223
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,500
It is said on the Internet that there are too many vehicles on the Second Northern Expressway

1224
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,660
The machine needs to know this is this

1225
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,500
otherwise you won't find

1226
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,900
Different meanings

1227
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,000
For example, someone wants to go online to find a brain doctor.

1228
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,660
He found a lot of brain

1229
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,300
But it doesn't look like a brain

1230
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,300
why

1231
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,500
Because there is a word break boundary in the middle

1232
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,700
it is computer science

1233
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,200
Some people want to go online to find folk land

1234
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,200
The folk belief is called the God of the Land

1235
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,400
Then he went to find a lot of land owners

1236
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,700
But it's strange why the Landlord has a policy

1237
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,600
you find out it wasn't

1238
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:48,400
Because he's talking about public ownership of land and so on.

1239
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,000
Of course, there are errors in speech recognition and so on.

1240
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,600
These are all the problems you can imagine

1241
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,400
Well, the above paragraph explains about this sound recognition

1242
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,400
how to do it

1243
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
So we're going to go into this sound search

1244
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Explain what we mean by sound search

1245
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
What is Voice Information Search

1246
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
What is its relationship to text information search

1247
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
This is the Google we know today

1248
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I enter a text command

1249
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So what?

1250
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
The machine gave me a lot of files

1251
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
The text file contains all the things I want

1252
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
but we know

1253
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
All the instructions and documents

1254
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
can it be voice

1255
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
so i can

1256
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Use text commands to find audio files

1257
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
The so-called audio file is a piece of audio

1258
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
or a multimedia file

1259
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
a piece of multimedia

1260
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
it contains speech but no text

1261
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I have to rely on the voice signal inside

1262
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
to judge the rocky beach

1263
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Then of course I can use voice commands to find text files

1264
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I can also use voice commands to find audio files

1265
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
These three are different things

1266
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
three different questions

1267
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,600
Technically there are different proper nouns to describe it

1268
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,400
But we call it what we call audio search

1269
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,400
Among these three things, today is the easiest and most mature

1270
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,700
It is the so-called voice search in the middle

1271
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,200
In other words, use voice commands to find text files

1272
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:23,400
Why does it actually just take the original text instruction

1273
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,500
Find a text file and add one in front of it

1274
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,400
When the voice command comes in, I will convert it into text first

1275
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,400
Just do the same later

1276
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,400
So like Google has its voice search

1277
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,600
that's what it is

1278
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,800
Add a voice interface in front of Google's existing entire Google, etc.

1279
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,600
But in fact you can learn about us today

1280
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,600
The main part of my talk today is the other two

1281
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,800
That is, if what I'm looking for is an audio file,

1282
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,900
Whether it's through voice commands

1283
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,400
or text commands

1284
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,200
No matter which one of them is basically

1285
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,100
you imagine me to do things

1286
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,120
turn voice into text

1287
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,760
Then I do a text search

1288
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,400
to find

1289
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,320
if you said it before

1290
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,960
it seems easy

1291
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,520
The biggest problem is

1292
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,520
identification must be wrong

1293
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,400
Our Speech Recognition Technology Today

1294
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,320
still have a ton of errors

1295
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,280
why wrong

1296
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,880
just now you can probably imagine

1297
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,320
We say that light cannot pour

1298
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,800
The two are different

1299
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,520
so you need to know

1300
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,400
which signal is which word

1301
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,120
It's not easy

1302
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,120
first thought was

1303
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,920
I can use word graph to reduce

1304
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,720
The impact of misidentification

1305
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,040
as if we just saw

1306
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,120
in one sentence

1307
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,120
I don't want to just recognize it as a sentence

1308
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,920
Because there may be a lot of typos in it.

1309
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,120
But I can put all possible

1310
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,040
List all the words and turn them into a picture

1311
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:44,640
In this case

1312
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,200
all my words i can take into account

1313
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,120
So the correct word is taken into account the chance

1314
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,160
greatly increased

1315
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:50,920
But

1316
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,400
This also adds a lot of wrong words

1317
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,920
So I'm likely finding a bunch of wrong things

1318
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,040
while the correct word may still not be in it

1319
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,200
especially the words outside the dot

1320
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,800
it won't recognize it at all

1321
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,100
Of course I need a lot of calculations

1322
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,000
etc.

1323
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,900
There are many other ways

1324
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,200
But I won't talk about this today

1325
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,600
let's talk about another thing

1326
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,200
What should I do if many words are not in the word points?

1327
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,200
In fact, this is easier to deal with

1328
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,000
Our usual approach today is to use so-called word units

1329
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,800
is a unit smaller than words

1330
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,200
You immediately think that every language has its basic sounds

1331
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,400
Treat the basic sound as a unit

1332
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,800
also can

1333
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,100
For example

1334
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,300
suppose it's a word

1335
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,100
W

1336
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:40,000
It is made up of these four small basic sounds

1337
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,800
lexical units

1338
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,000
But since it's not in the dot

1339
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,500
So it will not appear in the word map

1340
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,500
This is a line of words in the word map

1341
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,200
they just don't have the word

1342
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,600
Then these other ABCDs are also other word units

1343
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,500
no

1344
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,600
But if you look closely, you'll see

1345
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,560
I want this word is obviously hidden in this sub-word

1346
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,880
So I just do the comparison at the subword level

1347
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,240
it can be compared

1348
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,240
It doesn't matter if you don't recognize it

1349
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,800
So when I'm looking for Obama

1350
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,640
Obama is in

1351
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,240
Although Obama is not in my dictionary

1352
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,360
it doesn't matter

1353
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:18,800
etc.

1354
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,320
the subunit

1355
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,640
In fact different languages

1356
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,640
The most suitable units are not the same

1357
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,200
There are also people who directly use data to push him to do data driven

1358
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,920
That is to say, let the data tell me

1359
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,920
Which is the best unit etc.

1360
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,320
good

1361
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,600
Let's talk about

1362
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:38,200
Some recent examples of using voice for information search

1363
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,200
Compare some examples of relevant research

1364
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,600
Most of this is what we did at National Taiwan University

1365
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,000
So some simple examples

1366
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,200
Let everyone know

1367
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,600
Then the biggest problem we mentioned just now is that the identification will be wrong.

1368
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,720
Then we can imagine

1369
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,320
This audio information search that most people want

1370
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,200
this is the picture

1371
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,800
There's a whole bunch of audio digital content over here.

1372
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,800
Do sound recognition first

1373
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,800
Turn every sentence into a word graph

1374
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,000
When the user enters a command

1375
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,800
For example, he wants to find Obama

1376
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,800
So we searched for the introduction

1377
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,000
Just find it in these largest word graphs

1378
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,400
where is obama

1379
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,000
This idea is basically reasonable

1380
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
just saying he has the biggest problem

1381
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,800
Because he combines identification with search

1382
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,000
into two units

1383
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,800
Train them individually and connect them together

1384
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,800
so misidentification leads to wrong search results

1385
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,600
how good your search is

1386
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,600
may not be able to recover from misidentification

1387
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,600
So what we think about is

1388
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:42,000
How to break the frame of these two units connected in series

1389
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
These two connect him forever

1390
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,800
Can't fix this error

1391
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,600
So after we break it down

1392
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,600
rethink a thing

1393
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:54,600
Integrative thinking to reduce the impact of misidentification

1394
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,600
Let's give a few examples of this

1395
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,600
The first example is the so-called virtual correct feedback

1396
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,240
The idea is that if you're looking for Obama

1397
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:08,000
Suppose you already know that there is really Obama in a certain sentence

1398
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,400
Then other possible sentences that are similar to him can get extra points

1399
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,560
the idea is simple

1400
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,800
The problem is how do I know which sentence is correct?

1401
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,840
I have no idea

1402
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,560
This way I'm assuming I'm doing the first search first

1403
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,760
get a bunch of results

1404
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,600
I become a search result

1405
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,360
Assuming the ex-en name inside is correct

1406
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,920
so what will it be

1407
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,040
like this

1408
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,280
this is my command

1409
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,680
like Obama

1410
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,720
My machine got a bunch of results the first time I searched

1411
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,520
is the search result

1412
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,480
The machine at least judges that they all look like Obama

1413
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,560
I don't show this result to the user

1414
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,240
Because there are many mistakes in it

1415
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:50,680
I'll take the ex-en name in this first

1416
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,640
assuming he's right

1417
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,280
So everyone else went to compare with him to see the similarity

1418
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,040
Then if any of your voices follow the former name

1419
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,200
people are like

1420
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,400
That means he probably really has Obama.

1421
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,200
you can give him extra points

1422
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,600
Then I can reorder

1423
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,200
After getting a better result

1424
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,000
users can see

1425
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,200
do so

1426
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,000
Mine is making considerable progress right now

1427
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,800
because this is indeed

1428
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,300
if they are all alike

1429
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,100
I'm afraid he really has Obama.

1430
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,000
Then there is one thing to say

1431
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,900
How is this similarity calculated?

1432
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,500
The similarity of this sound is difficult to calculate

1433
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,000
Let's take an example

1434
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,900
Suppose this is statement XI

1435
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:36,600
We feel like he has an Obama in him

1436
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,300
But I opened the word map to see

1437
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,400
Not just one Obama, but several

1438
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,300
I'll just pick the one with the highest score.

1439
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,900
Let's say this is Obama

1440
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:49,000
So where is the relative feature item ranked?

1441
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
This bunch of feature items

1442
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,500
I'm assuming he's Obama

1443
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,800
So what?

1444
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,700
another word from me

1445
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,800
kinda like having obama

1446
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,900
I'll just put that against Obama's bunch

1447
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,440
Take out that part too

1448
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,940
so i want to make them

1449
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,340
The two Obamas compare

1450
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,240
do they look like

1451
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,540
this is the problem

1452
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,440
Because they are different in length

1453
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,300
different lengths

1454
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,340
Obama inside is different

1455
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,640
how do i compare

1456
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,640
we need to make a

1457
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,440
so-called dynamic time calibration

1458
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,040
What does it mean

1459
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,040
if we look at

1460
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,840
This picture probably understands

1461
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,340
These are the two Obamas

1462
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,740
different length

1463
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,400
The sound of the wave in this bar is also different.

1464
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,940
how do i compare

1465
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:32,440
I put an Obama on the horizontal axis

1466
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,540
In addition, Obama is on the heavy axis

1467
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:37,600
If I draw the value of a certain parameter inside

1468
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,400
they have changes like this

1469
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,140
then you can imagine

1470
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:43,740
It is said that this point should be compared with this point

1471
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,440
compare this with this

1472
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,100
This is more like

1473
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,100
it means

1474
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,640
I want to be on this two-dimensional plane

1475
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,940
find a curve

1476
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:54,440
That curve tells me who's up against whom

1477
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,140
right

1478
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,540
Because they are different in length

1479
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,880
Here is a schematic

1480
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,980
The more realistic picture is the first

1481
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
this one

1482
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
This is the horizontal axis, the vertical axis, the two Obamas

1483
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
we understand that this is actually

1484
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
This painting is actually a ten-spectrum

1485
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
The vertical axis is the frequency

1486
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
this is the frequency

1487
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
then you can see that i am

1488
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
A quantity is compared with a quantity

1489
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
A quantity is compared with a quantity

1490
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
like this bunch of people said

1491
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
This item is at the same time as here

1492
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
A lot of items to compare and so on

1493
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
then i will do this

1494
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
After ten them well

1495
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Let's compare again

1496
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
let me know my accuracy

1497
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
my similarity

1498
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Okay, this is a method just mentioned

1499
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Let's think of another way

1500
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
we just said i assume

1501
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
In the search results, Qian Enming is correct

1502
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
It doesn't make sense

1503
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Why is Qian Enming right?

1504
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I think another way should be

1505
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I put all the search results

1506
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Take the similarity between the two

1507
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
to be used as a reference

1508
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
how to do it

1509
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Then we can put the search results inside

1510
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
every sentence

1511
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Treat it as a node and turn it into a graph

1512
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Between points and points is the similarity between dramas

1513
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
as the score of their connection

1514
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So a higher score means they are more like

1515
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
So the higher the score, the more similar it is

1516
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
We can do it with this

1517
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,000
For example, suppose the drama X1 is very similar to the two sentences of X2X3

1518
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Because they have a strong connection

1519
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
that they look alike

1520
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
If X2X3 are high scores

1521
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Then X1 should be extra points

1522
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
In the same way, if X1X2 are all low scores

1523
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Then X1 should be deducted points

1524
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
that means

1525
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
After we let all fractions flow on the graph

1526
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
let it converge

1527
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
This means that all similar sentences

1528
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Because their connection score is high

1529
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
they can reinforce each other

1530
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
This mutually reinforcing confirmation makes all changes

1531
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Yes, errors are reduced a lot

1532
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,640
Then after confirming the reinforcement

1533
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,640
We then confirm the results based on reinforcement

1534
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,140
to remake the sequence

1535
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,000
this time i am all sentences

1536
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,800
together to reinforce each other

1537
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,800
So I'm not predestined

1538
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,300
if i do

1539
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,700
Have my scores improved?

1540
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,200
Immediately noticeable improvement

1541
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,700
This is the second example

1542
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,700
give another example

1543
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,100
It's in machine learning

1544
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,500
so-called supporting imager

1545
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,700
We have learned about machine learning in recent years

1546
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,200
very popular topic

1547
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,700
because machine learning

1548
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:37,200
We can do a lot of things that we couldn't do in the past

1549
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,500
An example here is

1550
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,200
so-called supporting imager

1551
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,600
support victim machine

1552
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,800
or SVM

1553
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,400
The basic idea is this

1554
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,500
I'm still the same

1555
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,300
After the user enters a command Obama

1556
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:51,100
I get a bunch of voices that might be Obama's

1557
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,600
But I don't show this to users

1558
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,300
Because this is obviously wrong

1559
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,600
then what should we do

1560
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,700
I'll take this as my payout result

1561
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,100
Presupposition

1562
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
is right , as a right offense

1563
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
In the end Eun Myung assumed he was wrong

1564
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
make a mistake

1565
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Then, I'll build a

1566
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
so-called supporting camera

1567
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
right and wrong examples

1568
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
to build one between them

1569
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
how to divide

1570
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
After that, I take mine

1571
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
What about the results of all the departures?

1572
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Throw it into this camera

1573
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
let him reorder

1574
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
get good , better sort

1575
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
The result is the result

1576
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
users see

1577
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Then here we have to explain a little bit

1578
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
This SVM or support camera

1579
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
what is

1580
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
What it means is

1581
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
In phasor space there are two groups

1582
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
known phasor

1583
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
assuming these are correct

1584
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
these are wrong

1585
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I want to find a plane and divide them

1586
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
what about this plane

1587
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
you may be like this

1588
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
it could be

1589
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
you want to take

1590
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
seem

1591
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
this is the best why

1592
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,880
because if you look at it this way

1593
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,380
it has the largest interval

1594
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,080
in other words

1595
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,680
if you look at this

1596
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,680
it's a little too close

1597
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,960
Not very good

1598
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,000
if you look at it this way

1599
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
it's a little too close

1600
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,400
It's not good to be too close

1601
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,400
That's when it's going to be like this

1602
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,000
They are separated by the largest

1603
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I'll just put the closest point here

1604
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
this way for best results

1605
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
This is the so-called support think two doses

1606
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
After you get this flat separation

1607
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
The new position phasor is thrown in

1608
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
just use this to separate

1609
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
see it and know it's right

1610
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
still wrong

1611
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Then I can actually use it

1612
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
distance from this plane

1613
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
can be reordered

1614
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Sort in this vertical direction

1615
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
i will know

1616
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Who is the most correct and so on

1617
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
of course

1618
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
many times

1619
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
There will be some exception errors

1620
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
For example

1621
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
These are correct Obama

1622
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
but there is one more

1623
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
For example, he was talking about

1624
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,260
The student who gave birth to Europe, how about his parents

1625
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,760
So what about Ou's parents?

1626
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,160
hey come in too

1627
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,460
Then it's a wrong exception

1628
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:10,460
There is also the correct exception running to the

1629
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,160
If you have to divide it like this, it will be too difficult.

1630
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,760
So we usually allow some exception errors

1631
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,460
So why can I

1632
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:21,460
such planes cut them

1633
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:24,660
And these two are the exceptions to the error

1634
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,160
etc.

1635
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,660
Of course, there are still many times, no matter how you do it.

1636
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:32,920
I'm actually having a hard time separating the two groups.

1637
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,920
How can it be difficult to tell them apart?

1638
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,320
We figured out how to use some mathematical models

1639
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,920
Convert it to a different or higher space

1640
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,320
hope in that space

1641
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,520
they can be cut and so on

1642
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:48,120
Then these are the basic spirits of the phasor class

1643
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,320
After understanding that, let's go back and read what we just said.

1644
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,220
We just said, let's say he's looking for Obama

1645
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:57,620
Then the first time I found out, the results are these

1646
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:58,920
Then I don't show it to the user

1647
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,180
Because he has a lot of

1648
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,200
I just assume that the top N names are the correct examples

1649
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,200
The last N names are wrong examples

1650
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,600
I just use this to go

1651
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:12,500
A bunch of wrong and right to build a support item measuring machine

1652
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,500
Then he told me where the real cutting plane is

1653
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,200
So I threw all the output results in

1654
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,400
According to the vertical distance of this plane

1655
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,100
to reorder

1656
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,900
Only the output results are shown to the user

1657
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,100
what's the result

1658
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,600
Immediately there will be great progress, etc.

1659
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:35,800
I think the above few examples show how we can do something like this

1660
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,200
Of course some people want to say

1661
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,500
if it is like this

1662
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,800
so can i just

1663
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,800
Since your speech recognition errors are so many

1664
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,400
I don't want to recognize

1665
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,600
because I can let the user directly use the

1666
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:49,300
input voice command

1667
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:50,600
Since your command is voice

1668
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,400
I just follow this audio file on the Internet

1669
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,400
Just go and compare with those

1670
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,900
Can I beat the signal?

1671
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,000
This is the greatest benefit that can be done

1672
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,880
It's just that I forgot to identify

1673
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,800
There is no such thing as misidentification.

1674
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,120
but it is difficult

1675
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,280
you know what we just said

1676
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,120
It's different if you don't reach those two

1677
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,040
the same person said the same reason

1678
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,520
can be very different

1679
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,040
What's more, different people say the same sentence

1680
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,200
is quite different

1681
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,960
So it's very likely that you've been comparing for a long time

1682
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,280
not easy to match

1683
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,480
So so far

1684
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,920
This is an important research direction

1685
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,000
However, due to the lack of identification

1686
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,840
The correct total value to compare against

1687
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,800
So it's still pretty bad

1688
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,040
Let's take an example

1689
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,800
The dynamic time calibration we just talked about

1690
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,000
It's a very good way to compare

1691
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,120
This is the various sounds in the sound file

1692
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,320
This is a phonetic designation such as

1693
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,480
He's looking for Obama

1694
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,040
I'll take him

1695
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,160
so compare i need

1696
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,240
Two by two I go to find between them

1697
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,960
the curve that can be compared

1698
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,840
Then go compare and so on

1699
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,960
This calculation is very large

1700
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,160
In order to reduce this calculation

1701
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,360
can also be done like this

1702
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,040
That is, I first put the voice in

1703
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
The more similar parts are cut into sections

1704
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,600
that's almost one tone

1705
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,760
For example this could be O

1706
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,540
this is 8

1707
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:07,540
This wave R

1708
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:09,540
This is Ma Mo R and so on

1709
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:10,440
if so

1710
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,340
I will compare it piece by piece

1711
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,740
can do like this

1712
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:14,400
But what?

1713
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,600
This is much less computationally intensive

1714
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,240
but

1715
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,440
I can't be more correct

1716
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,540
Of course there is a better way

1717
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,440
we feel today

1718
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,040
At this stage it looks like the best way to do this is to

1719
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,340
use the model

1720
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:30,100
That is to say, in this audio file

1721
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:30,800
all voices

1722
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,700
I have built it into

1723
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,880
The hidden Markov model we just talked about

1724
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,480
The biggest advantage of becoming a model is that

1725
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,800
it has a lot of chance

1726
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,580
So put every possible variation

1727
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,180
It's all in there

1728
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:43,380
So why?

1729
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:45,580
To deal with different people saying the same sentence

1730
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,100
What about the difference in the signal?

1731
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,440
This model works better

1732
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,100
Therefore

1733
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:53,000
What if the user says I want to find Obama?

1734
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,380
This, this, using this voice signal

1735
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,780
What about these models?

1736
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,820
is more effective

1737
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,760
This is how this series of ideas

1738
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,600
Another idea called concept comparison

1739
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,360
What is concept comparison?

1740
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:10,160
It means that if the user says that I want Obama

1741
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:14,840
Of course the machine I hope he gives me all the sentences with Obama in them

1742
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,040
But there are some sentences in

1743
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,880
Without the word Obama

1744
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,560
He was talking about something from the White House.

1745
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,680
I wish I could find it too

1746
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,520
Because he's what I want

1747
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,360
this means it works

1748
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:31,000
Just without the literal Obama

1749
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,200
In other words, we have the so-called literal comparison and conceptual comparison.

1750
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,800
Literal comparison is easier

1751
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,720
Just ask Obama

1752
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,920
Concept comparison seems to be much more difficult

1753
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,240
Because you need to know the White House and Obama

1754
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:48,360
Actually, they are two very common words.

1755
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,080
That is to say, I want to find sentences related to meaning

1756
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:55,000
Even if it doesn't include your directive

1757
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,120
There are many ways to do this

1758
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,960
Below I think two simple examples to illustrate

1759
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,640
what do they mean

1760
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,680
first method

1761
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,440
I'm trying to analyze the sentence inside

1762
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,140
hidden semantics

1763
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:09,240
this is what we call

1764
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,200
Latent Semantic Analysis

1765
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,840
There are many ways of doing this

1766
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,500
is a simple example

1767
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,040
so-called probabilistic analysis

1768
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,300
The so-called PLSA

1769
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,540
how to explain this

1770
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,500
We use a very simple concept to think

1771
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,840
Let's say it's a bunch of files

1772
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,140
Or a bunch of voice files would work too

1773
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:28,680
Text files can also

1774
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:29,880
if in terms of voice

1775
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,680
a bunch of sentences

1776
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,680
there are many words in them

1777
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,580
There are many words in each

1778
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:38,480
The computer really doesn't know which word

1779
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,020
what word does it have to do with

1780
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:40,980
or something

1781
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,280
still don't know

1782
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,980
But a computer can do one thing

1783
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,580
it can be found saying

1784
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:48,180
inside this pile of files

1785
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:51,180
always have these words

1786
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:52,580
inside this pile of files

1787
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,580
there are these words again

1788
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:56,280
So we can imagine

1789
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,880
These documents and these words

1790
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,880
maybe talking about a

1791
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,560
the concept or theme

1792
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,040
These dictionaries are similar to this

1793
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:05,440
It should be another concept

1794
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,280
or another topic

1795
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,000
For example

1796
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,040
if this was obama

1797
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,480
This is the economic policy of the United States

1798
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,840
this is the presidential election

1799
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,160
this is probably a theme

1800
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,480
if this is bin laden

1801
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,400
this is iran

1802
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,480
this is baghdad

1803
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,040
it might be another thing

1804
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,240
etc.

1805
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,080
If you think about it this way

1806
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,200
what we do here

1807
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,240
In fact, it is assumed that there is a series of

1808
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,560
hidden theme or concept

1809
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,000
that's it

1810
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,960
Then we base the vocabulary on

1811
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:35,920
in a different file

1812
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,000
Co-Occurrence Statistics

1813
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,440
to analyze what themes are

1814
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:41,760
so i will know

1815
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,200
Obama and the White House

1816
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,680
belong to the same subject

1817
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,000
so they are

1818
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,960
I though this directive is Obama

1819
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,080
I can also find those

1820
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,440
stuff in the white house

1821
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:52,960
it's a concept

1822
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,600
that another way

1823
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,720
This so-called instruction extension

1824
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,160
query expansion

1825
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,160
Let's use a simple example

1826
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
keeps stating that he assumes the user enters Obama

1827
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I made this instruction into a so-called instruction model

1828
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
It's nothing special. He's just an Obama.

1829
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
That's all the words only W2 the word Obama

1830
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Yes probability is 1, everything else is 0

1831
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Then I'll do the first search with this command

1832
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
get my search results

1833
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I can't allow users to see the search results

1834
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
because there are many mistakes

1835
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Then I'll assume ex Eun Myung is right

1836
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Count what words are used in them

1837
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
For example, there are Obamas here, there are Obamas here

1838
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,000
But here's the White House, he also has the White House

1839
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
That means the White House should be what you want too.

1840
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
So I use this to make a new instruction model

1841
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
just add the white house

1842
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
But in turn, there's bin Laden over here.

1843
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
no bin laden here

1844
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
bin laden better not

1845
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Wait so I can create a new command

1846
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,640
It is a lot more than the original instruction

1847
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,640
just expanded

1848
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:06,440
I'll find it again with this command

1849
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:09,160
I only show users what I find out

1850
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,560
This is the so-called instruction extension

1851
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:16,880
Another big problem is

1852
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,280
Even if we use Google to find text files today

1853
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:26,160
We also know that it is helpful for users to interact with the system

1854
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,240
So for example, if you enter who

1855
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,520
After he showed me a bunch of stuff

1856
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,760
let me click what to wait

1857
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,840
This interaction is very important

1858
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,680
But with English or multimedia content

1859
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:40,680
The biggest problem is that it's not easy to render on the screen

1860
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,200
So it's not as clear as text

1861
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,800
is not easy to choose

1862
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,240
I can't listen to every one of them

1863
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,840
After listening to it, I found that it wasn't what I wanted.

1864
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,560
In this way, the user writes that the machine must be thrown away

1865
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:55,280
So how do we make it easy for users to

1866
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,040
Browse click

1867
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,040
like text

1868
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,760
this is a big problem

1869
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I found a lot of things and don't know what to do

1870
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
how to do this

1871
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
We are thinking of the following methods

1872
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
what about the first one

1873
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I think of a way to replace the digital content of these voices only

1874
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Build some language sessions of its keywords, etc.

1875
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Then create its title, create its summary

1876
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Then what

1877
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I try to build some knowledge structure

1878
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
let me help me click to browse

1879
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
has a nice user interface

1880
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Then what

1881
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I allow users to talk to my system

1882
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I'm going to say these things quickly

1883
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
For example

1884
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
for example

1885
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
First

1886
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
We say that in this audio file

1887
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
We hope to catch some key

1888
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Key words or key phrases

1889
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
There are only two

1890
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
a word is called a keyword

1891
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Otherwise, multiple words are called key phrases

1892
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Then we need to find these things out

1893
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
The first question is that the key phrase has several words

1894
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
How do I know which words together form a key phrase?

1895
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,540
For example

1896
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:03,080
President Barack Obama

1897
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:06,160
This is an obvious key phrase

1898
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,680
How do I know it should be a key phrase?

1899
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:09,920
for example

1900
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,200
If I found in my data

1901
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,840
the right side of america is often followed by the same word

1902
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,600
the word is called president

1903
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:20,120
American presidents are often followed by the same word to the right

1904
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,400
that word is called obama

1905
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:24,880
But President Obama's right

1906
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,960
followed by many different words

1907
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,280
that means

1908
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,880
This should be the right border of a phrase

1909
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,400
Similarly I can also find

1910
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,040
This is the left boundary of a phrase

1911
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,440
because there are many

1912
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:42,240
so I can use various statistics for each context

1913
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:45,440
to figure out its boundaries

1914
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,600
Knowing the boundaries doesn't mean he must be the key phrase

1915
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,600
So we still need a lot of other knowledge to confirm him

1916
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,520
For example

1917
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,600
The first confirmation is a mistake

1918
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:57,600
Everyone knows

1919
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,040
when the speaker says key words

1920
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
or key phrases

1921
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
it often speaks a little slower

1922
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,500
the volume will be higher

1923
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,500
The change in pitch will be a little bigger

1924
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,000
That's the obvious message to me

1925
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
it is the keyword

1926
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
again the word itself

1927
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,500
we could have just said

1928
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,500
We can analyze its underlying themes

1929
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,000
or concept

1930
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I can based on its theme

1931
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,500
or concept to know

1932
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:23,000
Is it a keyword

1933
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
For example

1934
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
the word obama

1935
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,500
possibly in two themes

1936
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,000
high probability

1937
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,500
This is the US presidential election

1938
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,500
This is America

1939
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,500
West Season Bin Laden

1940
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,500
Both of these are highly likely

1941
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,000
Other chances are very low

1942
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,500
Let's say this is the Oscars

1943
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,500
This is a baseball game in Taiwan

1944
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:47,500
None of them have Obama

1945
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,500
This looks like a keyword

1946
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,500
why keywords

1947
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,000
Usually only concentrated in

1948
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
A handful of conceptual themes inside

1949
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
This is for example a

1950
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
today or morning

1951
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
or very

1952
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
This kind of word appears in almost every topic

1953
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
That means it's probably not a keyword, and so on.

1954
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Of course there are other important knowledge

1955
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
For example, the frequency of occurrence of the word

1956
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
its part of speech etc.

1957
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
it's all about

1958
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
What I just talked about is how to extract keywords

1959
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Let's talk about how to do file extraction

1960
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
These will be shown to you in actual combat later.

1961
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Then the voice file we hope to be able to extract

1962
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Automatically draw a pill

1963
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
How to draw it? For example, this is a voice file

1964
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
There are six sentences in it

1965
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
A circle in each sentence means a word

1966
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
This blue one means correct identification

1967
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Red indicates identification error

1968
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
if i have a way to find out in there

1969
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
two particularly important sentences

1970
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
wrap it up

1971
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
as medicine

1972
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
What if I treat it as after taking the medicine?

1973
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
It can be played back with its original sound

1974
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
As long as it is the original sound played out

1975
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
it's the wrong question

1976
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
it all sounds right

1977
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
What about this?

1978
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
is what we call this sound

1979
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
voice summary

1980
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
So of course the question is how to choose the drama

1981
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
There are several basic principles in the selection of plays

1982
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
for example

1983
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Anything that contains more

1984
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
more important word

1985
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
or words that look more like keywords

1986
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
it's more important

1987
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
it contains

1988
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Because I can analyze concepts now

1989
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
So if it contains the concept

1990
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Closer to the concept of the full text

1991
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
that should be more important

1992
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
In addition

1993
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
What if a sentence has been selected?

1994
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
It concept should be next sentence to avoid repetition

1995
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
etc.

1996
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Then I can build my

1997
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
audio summary

1998
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
I can show you this later

1999
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
example

2000
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
come again

2001
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I also wish to generate headers

2002
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Because the title is easier to click

2003
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
what about the title

2004
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
you know

2005
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
The characteristic of this title is

2006
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
it is text

2007
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
it should be shorter

2008
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
but to read

2009
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Let me give you an example here

2010
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
The basic way we do headlines

2011
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
is the voice file

2012
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,400
I first identify

2013
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,600
then make a summary

2014
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,800
i by the words inside the abstract

2015
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,400
Then choose the important words in it

2016
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,600
make a title

2017
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,200
There are optional words

2018
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,400
model with word choice

2019
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,800
how to sort words

2020
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,000
sorted model

2021
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,400
How long should the title have it's model etc

2022
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,200
These models use training corpus

2023
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,400
trained

2024
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,200
What's the meaning

2025
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,600
Because I can catch a lot of words written by people on the Internet

2026
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,000
with title in it

2027
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
someone made the title

2028
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,200
The text I can write about the candidate

2029
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,200
Make headlines with people to train those in the middle

2030
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,200
how to choose words

2031
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,600
how to sort

2032
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,000
how does it determine its length etc.

2033
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,600
so I can use this to make the title

2034
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,400
This meeting will also show you the real thing

2035
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,200
come again

2036
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,200
knowledge structure

2037
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,400
what is knowledge structure

2038
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,400
we don't know

2039
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,200
But let's give two examples

2040
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,400
The first example is that we put any

2041
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,800
concept or theme

2042
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,600
Subdivide the concept or theme of the audio file

2043
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,000
and then arrange it into a two-dimensional vertical structure

2044
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,560
For example, if the concept theme is very similar, turn it into a group of

2045
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,820
Put a piece inside the two

2046
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:10,920
I tag it with a set of keywords

2047
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:14,080
Let the user know what it is at a glance

2048
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:17,360
And then, if there are many uniform groups

2049
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:21,480
I can go down one more layer and expand and divide into groups and so on.

2050
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,880
I will show you an example of this later

2051
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:30,600
What's more, I can also make a picture of keywords

2052
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,160
For example, if I find a bunch of voice files

2053
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:37,200
I find the keywords for each voice file

2054
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:41,880
Mark it with these key words to mark what it is

2055
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,560
Then what about the relationship between these keywords?

2056
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,560
I can draw a picture to show how they are related

2057
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,640
This helped me find

2058
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,440
I will show you an example of this later

2059
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,440
One last thing to say

2060
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,520
There is one more dialogue, how to do the dialogue?

2061
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,280
Just assume that the user enters a command

2062
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,600
Also looking for the President of the United States

2063
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,960
Then the machine went to find it

2064
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,600
As a result, what the President of the United States did

2065
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,720
a lot of weird

2066
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,440
very scattered

2067
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,840
so that the result is so bad

2068
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,680
The machine knows it's not working

2069
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,360
If this large pile is handed over to the user

2070
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,040
Users are annoyed

2071
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,360
So we don't provide this result to the user

2072
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:29,080
Ask the user to say if you can add one more command

2073
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:30,760
so the user

2074
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,120
what i want is diplomacy

2075
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,160
After having this, the machine will look different again

2076
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,080
He found a lot of things about the president of the United States related to diplomacy

2077
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,120
However, there is a trend

2078
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:45,000
That is, many of them are related to the Middle East.

2079
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,160
Middle East is their keyword

2080
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:48,800
Since this is the case

2081
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:50,760
but still messy

2082
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,120
At this time, the machine can use this keyword

2083
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,200
Go to confirm with the user that what you want is the Middle East

2084
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,440
If this is the user says yes

2085
01:18:59,680 --> 01:18:59,960
right

2086
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
then i can throw all the middle east to it

2087
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Then probably won't die

2088
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Or the user says no, what I want is Asia

2089
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
That's okay, I already know it's Asia.

2090
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I can search again and find Asia and so on

2091
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
this is called a dialogue

2092
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Okay, so I've said everything on the picture just now.

2093
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Here is a summary of the key vocabulary title Knowledge Structure Dialogue

2094
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Alright, most of what I'm going to say today ends here.

2095
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
The last paragraph below is to show you some live demonstrations

2096
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
We are divided into three levels

2097
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
a general structure

2098
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
one is general knowledge

2099
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
one is professional knowledge

2100
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
one is language learning

2101
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Let's look at the first general knowledge part first

2102
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,000
What we show you is official news

2103
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
same ok

2104
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
No, is your system turned on?

2105
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
turn on the system first

2106
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:07,000
The formula news on our side is from 2002 to 2003

2107
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
A total of about 1100 pieces were recorded

2108
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
sorry 6000

2109
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
News with a formula of about 110 hours

2110
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,000
make a news system

2111
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:27,000
It was done in the spring of 2006

2112
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
So it's an old system from 7 years ago

2113
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,000
We didn't put it online at the time

2114
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
only in one machine

2115
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,000
So we still bring that machine to repair today for everyone to see

2116
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
So it's a comparison

2117
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
OK

2118
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
minimize it first

2119
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
OK good

2120
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
OK, let's take a look now

2121
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
what i'm going to say now is this is this

2122
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,600
first general knowledge

2123
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,200
Our example is TV news

2124
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,800
So let's think about what TV news is like

2125
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,800
basically it probably contains no text

2126
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,800
Then its themes are very diverse

2127
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,300
So the group title we just said

2128
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,600
Keywords are helpful for browsing

2129
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,400
it's not easy to recognize

2130
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,100
Because there are so many new words

2131
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:25,400
But for most news

2132
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:28,500
Most users don't need to know that detailed

2133
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:31,300
So cheating on the title is helpful

2134
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:34,500
The information of each news itself is complete

2135
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,700
Listen to news without additional information

2136
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:41,300
So the purpose of the knowledge structure is to assist browsing

2137
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:45,500
Okay, let's look at the part just now

2138
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,100
Let's show you a TV news first

2139
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:50,100
you can find out

2140
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:54,900
The voice signal of this formula news is below

2141
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:58,000
You see the full length is more than 1 minute and 40 seconds

2142
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Then we have this in sync

2143
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,840
The picture is also drawn here

2144
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,040
We can listen once to know what it's talking about

2145
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,000
Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737

2146
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,240
When flying from Baltimore to Chicago

2147
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,160
On landing in a blizzard

2148
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,240
overshot the runway and the airport fence

2149
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,640
It hit two cars on the road

2150
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,000
At that time, after the chicken blood was beaten to 18 centimeters

2151
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,440
Is the plane under surveillance because it ran too slippery?

2152
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,920
Authorities are still investigating

2153
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,480
Chicago Airport 33 years ago

2154
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,320
There has also been a major crash

2155
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:34,200
are all in the result radio

2156
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:36,560
Kashiba GG

2157
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,400
I can speed up

2158
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,600
but can follow the master tape

2159
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:42,000
this three-letter sound

2160
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,240
no translation

2161
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,520
then we are not good

2162
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:49,580
as long as we are

2163
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:50,360
understand that is a

2164
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,560
only a few places

2165
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,280
1 times the word today Haven

2166
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,600
Already counted

2167
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,600
I see this Tongiting La Viet

2168
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,840
Runway and airport fence results

2169
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:00,000
Collide

2170
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,240
put two cars on the road

2171
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:05,000
One dead, eleven wounded

2172
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,200
Chicago International Airport in the midst of an out-of-air accident

2173
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,560
still snowing

2174
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:15,000
Fire trucks and ambulances rushed to the scene immediately

2175
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,520
But the university keeps going

2176
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,440
It also increases the difficulty of rescue

2177
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,320
The accident happened at local time

2178
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,240
7:15pm on the 8th

2179
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,880
Southwest Airlines had 103 passengers on board

2180
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,080
Active Crew Boeing Air Fan Airliner

2181
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,640
Flying from Baltimore to Chicago Airport

2182
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,040
Suspected because of bad weather

2183
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,000
Winning off the runway and forming a strong knot

2184
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Hit two cars on the road

2185
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,920
One of them got stuck under the plane

2186
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,240
6-year-old boy dies in car

2187
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,760
Eleven people on board and on the ground were injured

2188
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,480
The plane itself was also involved in the collision

2189
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,360
Damaged the nose and dropped a Secret

2190
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,480
Eyewitnesses described the situation

2191
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,000
The airport staff pointed out that when the snow reached 18 centimeters,

2192
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Did this plane create momentum because it flew to Taihua?

2193
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Authorities are still investigating

2194
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
33 years ago, there was one at the Chicago airport.

2195
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
major crash accident

2196
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
45 people left

2197
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
On this plane, airport personnel at the time noted that

2198
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
The airport staff at the time pointed out that

2199
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
The airport staff at the time pointed out that

2200
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
The airport staff at the time pointed out that

2201
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
The airport staff at the time pointed out that

2202
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
The airport staff at the time pointed out that

2203
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
The airport staff at the time pointed out that

2204
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
The airport staff at the time pointed out that

2205
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
45 people left

2206
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Fruit News This Meeting Variation

2207
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
This is more than 1 minute and 40 seconds of news

2208
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Everyone, just saw

2209
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
let's see again

2210
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
How did we extract the summary?

2211
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Just find these two sentences in it

2212
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
this red sentence

2213
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
with this red line

2214
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
These two sentences are the most important sentences

2215
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
wrap it up

2216
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Almost the most important part of the full text

2217
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
we call it a summary

2218
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
These two add up to 19 seconds

2219
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
What about the picture?

2220
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
we need another team

2221
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Help us draw important pictures

2222
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
It is based on the message of the screen

2223
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
For example, someone's face is moving

2224
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
changed face

2225
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
or this thing that's moving

2226
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
is the important thing

2227
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
They also add up to 19 seconds in this way

2228
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
So get a 19 second pick

2229
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
let's see it again now

2230
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737

2231
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
When flying from Faltimore to Chicago

2232
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
blizzard on landing

2233
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
overshot the runway and the airport fence

2234
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
It hit two cars on the road

2235
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
When the snow reached 18 centimeters

2236
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Is this plane making a fuss about being too slippery?

2237
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Authorities are still investigating

2238
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Chicago Airport 33 years ago

2239
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
There was also a major crash

2240
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
you can see

2241
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
last sentence

2242
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
It is different from the previous sentence

2243
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
There are a lot of things in this

2244
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
In fact, the previous sentence already exists

2245
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
so no more

2246
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
etc.

2247
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
This is already taken

2248
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
we just said

2249
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Actually, I can make the title

2250
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Let's show you below

2251
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
This is a title made by a computer

2252
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
then you can initiate

2253
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,480
Whether it is the title or the abstract of this computer

2254
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,160
Of course no one does it well

2255
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,840
this man must do better

2256
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,520
But our point is not that he wants to compare with others

2257
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,800
but after having these things

2258
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,120
can help us browse

2259
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:15,000
Then sometimes I don't have to listen to the end

2260
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,480
And I saw his title

2261
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,400
listen to his abstract

2262
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,160
I know that, do I still want to listen?

2263
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,520
I really want to hear me go play the full thing

2264
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:22,320
on the line

2265
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:23,920
You may think

2266
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,400
You may have picked the best sentence for this one.

2267
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,400
come to this show

2268
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:28,720
that's not true

2269
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,720
I just said that our system

2270
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,640
What's inside is

2271
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,320
PTV News in 2002 to 2003

2272
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:45,200
a total of one hundred and ten hours

2273
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,720
One hundred and ten hours six thousand

2274
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,680
Every news does what it just did

2275
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,000
Then make a system like this

2276
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:54,800
That

2277
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:58,640
Katamin Ecstasy

2278
01:26:58,800 --> 01:26:59,960
or mahiro

2279
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Suoying, various types of bottles, Department of Health today

2280
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,000
This is the news we usually see when we go home and turn on the TV

2281
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Then I don't want to hear 80% of the news he tells.

2282
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
But turning around, there's nothing I want to hear

2283
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
So we want a formula like this

2284
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
such a news system

2285
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
The first one I put all received news

2286
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:25,000
made his abstract and title respectively

2287
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Abstract here Title here

2288
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Then I divide all the news into these six categories

2289
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
International Politics, Finance, etc.

2290
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,000
According to his content, it's all made by machines

2291
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Then my homepage is the one for each type of news

2292
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,000
The most recent one is presented with his title

2293
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Users can see if I want

2294
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
If you want, click him to get the complete news

2295
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Click on the summary and I will hear the summary

2296
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Of course, this, this, each of these may be

2297
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
not what i want to see

2298
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:01,920
then i can choose

2299
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,120
Let's say I just want to watch international news

2300
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:06,160
Well there's a whole lot of international news here

2301
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:11,120
Then I can watch political news, financial news, etc.

2302
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,960
even if that's the case

2303
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,960
There may be more international news

2304
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,000
you see so much international news

2305
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,040
Still hard to choose

2306
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,460
What should we do then?

2307
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:24,600
I can click on this bird to see the picture

2308
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,880
The picture of this bird is what we just saw

2309
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:31,640
is my analysis of news according to the vocabulary of its content

2310
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,340
I will divide it into nine categories

2311
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:35,640
Of course each category is

2312
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,240
computer doesn't know

2313
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,140
but what about each category

2314
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:40,140
i can smoke it keywords

2315
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:41,500
or key phrase

2316
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,720
after pulling out

2317
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,200
make it the most important keyword

2318
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,540
The highest score is listed here

2319
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:47,580
Let's see

2320
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:49,680
You can probably see what it is

2321
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:50,300
For example

2322
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:51,340
what is this

2323
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:54,000
There were planes, explosions, and earthquakes

2324
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,880
It's all kinds of natural and man-made disasters

2325
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:57,760
what is this

2326
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,080
Another Ministry of Health, another whale, another case

2327
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,600
I know this should be a health problem for the whole world

2328
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,300
with disease

2329
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:07,800
This is a chair-tooth dispute in the Middle East

2330
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,100
This is North and South Korea and so on

2331
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:12,700
It can be seen that the Overseas Bridge is full, etc.

2332
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,500
That's a little weird

2333
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,900
like nothing

2334
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:18,100
We later found out that this is

2335
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:20,500
none of above

2336
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:23,500
In other words, all the news we had at the time

2337
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,400
It can be roughly divided into these eight categories

2338
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,600
There is a category that is really nothing

2339
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,700
called none of the above

2340
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:33,300
Let's say I want to watch all kinds of natural and man-made disasters

2341
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:35,100
I can go in from here

2342
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,500
i get the next layer

2343
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:38,600
We just saw two-dimensional structures

2344
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:41,600
This layer expands it to nine

2345
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,400
This natural and man-made disaster can be divided into

2346
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,800
Let's say it's a homicide

2347
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,400
this is the plane that crashed

2348
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,600
volcanic earthquake tsunami

2349
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:49,400
you say it's weird

2350
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,800
Why do tsunamis and volcanoes go together

2351
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,900
because they use similar words

2352
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:56,400
For example, this hurricane will be with heavy snow

2353
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,700
It is also a similar relationship between the words used

2354
01:29:58,700 --> 01:29:59,700
may not find

2355
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,200
This strike is also a disaster

2356
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,800
because he used words like

2357
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,800
For example, road section or traffic impassability

2358
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,600
So the word used is like

2359
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,200
How do you say this teenager is also

2360
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:15,400
because he was a riot and so on

2361
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:18,200
So if you want to know about this teenager's disaster

2362
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,600
Scourge or something

2363
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,600
you click in to see

2364
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:22,800
that's what he's talking about

2365
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,400
then we can

2366
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,800
Because I only have two layers in total now

2367
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,000
In fact, this can be many layers

2368
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,800
But now because there is not much news about this

2369
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,400
So a total of two layers

2370
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,400
So by now it's bottom

2371
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,000
all of his

2372
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,200
There are many more news like that listed here

2373
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,000
etc.

2374
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,600
Then we can see for example

2375
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:39,800
what is this one about

2376
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,600
I can click in and have a look

2377
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,600
12 days of riots in France

2378
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,200
On the evening of the 7th in Paris and Toulouse

2379
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:49,600
Become again

2380
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:52,000
You probably know what he's talking about

2381
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,400
The title is sometimes weird

2382
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:56,000
but you probably know what he's talking about

2383
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
This is another one, let's click in and have a look

2384
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,160
The violent riots continued, and the sudden golden boy set fire on the street in the early morning of the 14th

2385
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:08,280
Wait, this browsing we call Top Down

2386
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,640
because you're looking down from the top of the tree

2387
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,440
Of course, I can do it the other way around.

2388
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,520
Battle Nights Looking Up from the Bottom

2389
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:18,440
If I go back to the main screen

2390
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,720
Let's say I'm here looking for international news

2391
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,160
I look down from here

2392
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:24,480
Suppose I see a certain news

2393
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:28,880
For example, the Iraqi election bombing, I want to see this one

2394
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,400
I'll just click in and see

2395
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:34,920
Eight big polling places just opened their doors

2396
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,240
let voters vote

2397
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,200
There was a loud bang in the green zone

2398
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,200
Suppose I see this one, when I finish this one,

2399
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,680
I feel like I want to know more news

2400
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:47,800
I can click related news

2401
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,360
related news

2402
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:53,000
It took me to that spot in its tree

2403
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,440
just here

2404
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:57,480
These are all about the Iraqi bombings, right?

2405
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:58,840
related news

2406
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,240
then i can do more

2407
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,200
I listen to the news here

2408
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,400
I can also go up one level

2409
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,200
just get

2410
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:06,100
i am here now

2411
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:08,200
It's eight brains exploding and so on.

2412
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,000
that belongs to this block

2413
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,200
I'm on the upper floor

2414
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:14,900
I will go back to the part of natural disaster characters and wait.

2415
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:18,500
This is where the guaranteed bottom-up search

2416
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:19,300
of course

2417
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,800
I can actually find something else

2418
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:22,500
For example

2419
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,700
If I go back to the main screen

2420
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:27,500
I can actually do the search directly

2421
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,500
In our case it is called retrieval

2422
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:32,400
let's try

2423
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,600
is it possible

2424
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:36,000
ok

2425
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:36,500
good

2426
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:54,900
good

2427
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,000
let's try

2428
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:00,000
I will retest

2429
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
try mute

2430
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:05,860
Okay, now I should be able to go in with my voice.

2431
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:06,620
so what

2432
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:08,900
try again

2433
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:13,320
then let's try

2434
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:15,800
Please help me find the White House

2435
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,900
It doesn't seem to go in. Let's do it again.

2436
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:28,620
Please help me find the White House

2437
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,500
good

2438
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:34,560
I want him not working now

2439
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:44,400
Please help me find the White House

2440
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:52,420
He changed the environment, it seems

2441
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:54,420
Please help me find the White House

2442
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,500
is such a relationship

2443
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,800
OK, let's try again, that's right.

2444
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,500
ok ok one more time

2445
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,300
OK, please help me find the White House

2446
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:19,300
No, still not

2447
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:29,200
Should be a little better. Let's do it again.

2448
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:32,500
Please help me find the White House

2449
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,000
Got it, got it, OK

2450
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
According to the New York Times report

2451
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Senior U.S. intelligence agent from Itain, Iran

2452
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,500
Emergencies of practice in computer

2453
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,500
Discover more than 1000 pages of computer patterns

2454
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,500
Strong selling shopping channel no matter what

2455
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,500
well what we just saw

2456
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,000
it moved

2457
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
this

2458
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,500
it moved

2459
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,000
ok i think u can make this

2460
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:11,000
This is what I just said was completed in 2006, 7 years ago

2461
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
So inevitably I'm talking now and he's going in

2462
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
so he keeps finding something else

2463
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
he found something different now

2464
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
OK, what about our part?

2465
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
we'll stop here

2466
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Let's go back to the main screen

2467
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Then I leave here too

2468
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Okay, I was talking about the TV news.

2469
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Let's look at the second one, which is professional knowledge

2470
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
What about specialized knowledge? A good example

2471
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
online course

2472
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
What about online courses, you can download

2473
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Imagine that there are so many online courses today

2474
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
But you often take a long time

2475
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
in order to fully learn

2476
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
For example, a 45-hour essay class

2477
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:12,000
It is difficult for a busy person to listen carefully for 45 hours

2478
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
so what can we do

2479
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
real online courses

2480
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
is searchable by a browser

2481
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
for example

2482
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
which one are you looking for

2483
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
just go find that part, you can find it

2484
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
the problem is to say

2485
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
The course is structured

2486
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
You learn the former to understand the latter

2487
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Then if you search for a piece of content you want to know

2488
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
but you haven't heard before

2489
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
maybe you don't understand

2490
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
then i don't know the background

2491
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
But I don't know how to find their relevant knowledge

2492
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I don't know what else to look for

2493
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
because of this relationship

2494
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
We just want to do an online course

2495
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
But it is intellectually structured

2496
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,000
This knowledge structure is what we just said

2497
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
But we use another thing

2498
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Online courses often have auxiliary slides

2499
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
we use auxiliary

2500
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
slideshow to do it

2501
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
For example

2502
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:09,000
I can join the meeting with a slideshow and its key

2503
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
to build knowledge structure

2504
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
I put the entire course content

2505
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
in slides

2506
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Each slide is cut into a small segment

2507
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Each subsection is represented by its key

2508
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
as the core of knowledge

2509
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,000
So I can put these keys in the meeting

2510
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Draw a picture to describe the relationship between them

2511
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
So each of my clips of slides

2512
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
while providing a wealth of knowledge

2513
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
For example, how long is it?

2514
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
you want to see how long it is

2515
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Then what are the key participants

2516
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
What are the relevant key participants

2517
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
What are the other related slides etc.

2518
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
This helps users click to browse

2519
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
If you do a search and find the statement

2520
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I also provide snippets of slideshows that belong

2521
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
and its related information

2522
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
to help users click through

2523
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
for example

2524
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:04,000
This is what we show you below

2525
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:04,800
this is a class

2526
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,400
This class is my class

2527
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,400
digital voice processing

2528
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:12,400
The content of this course is bilingual in Chinese and English

2529
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:15,400
That is to say, my lectures are taught in Chinese

2530
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:19,400
But all the professional numbers in it

2531
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:21,200
It's all in English and not translated into Chinese

2532
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:23,000
So it's a mixture of Chinese and English

2533
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
and spontaneous speech

2534
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,400
Which means I didn't read it from the script.

2535
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,500
I watched the slide show in class

2536
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,300
just wait

2537
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:32,700
such a signal

2538
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:37,200
So let's look at such a system

2539
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,700
We are called NTU Virtual Teachers

2540
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:46,700
this is his website

2541
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:47,500
this is on the website

2542
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:50,100
So we're now connecting directly through the network

2543
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:51,400
link to that site

2544
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,700
this is my class

2545
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:55,100
digital voice processing

2546
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:58,500
So this one was recorded in 2006

2547
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,500
So it was also

2548
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
It was recorded seven years ago

2549
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
This was done in 2009

2550
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
So it's four years old

2551
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
we just said

2552
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,000
We just divide it according to the slides

2553
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
for example

2554
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
This is the first one

2555
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
each

2556
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
first slide

2557
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
second slide

2558
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
etc.

2559
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Let's say I order the fourth slide

2560
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
I think this is the fourth slide

2561
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
etc.

2562
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I can also watch the next slide here

2563
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
previous slide

2564
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
this is fine

2565
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
He told me a bunch of info here

2566
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
For example

2567
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
this slide

2568
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:40,000
It took a total of three minutes and 44 seconds to finish the speech

2569
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
His position is in the first of eighteen

2570
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
This slideshow of him in the first one

2571
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
above wait

2572
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I can also say for example

2573
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
come back

2574
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
i choose one

2575
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,000
For example, the seventh

2576
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
i can watch

2577
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
For example, in the seventh

2578
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
a certain slide

2579
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
for example this

2580
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:05,200
This is his sixth slide

2581
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,400
It's his eighth slide, etc.

2582
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:09,600
Then I can also see that

2583
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,800
in my slide

2584
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:18,800
He said the full length of the slideshow is 2 minutes and 30 seconds

2585
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:24,000
He has a 15 second sample

2586
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,800
Then let me listen to this 15 second sample

2587
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:28,800
click down

2588
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,000
i can hear it all

2589
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,800
we listen to a 15 second sample of his

2590
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Hope this network can work

2591
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,400
Therefore the higher frequency part

2592
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:43,000
the fainter the less clear

2593
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,400
then we'll pull it up a bit

2594
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,200
So let's compare the sensitive feeling

2595
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:50,400
can feel it here

2596
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:53,800
That's what we're talking about here

2597
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:59,400
This preemphasis is a basic statement that it is pulling up

2598
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,200
That's the 15 minute pill

2599
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:05,920
The title of my slide is pre-emphasis

2600
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,400
Then take the medicine in 15 seconds

2601
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:09,600
i can listen to all the wait

2602
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:12,600
Of course I can also search

2603
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:15,000
We can look here to search

2604
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,600
For example, let's say where I am listening to a lecture

2605
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:21,520
I also heard someone say that it looks like a Blackbird Algo

2606
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:22,200
what

2607
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:23,600
is it in here

2608
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:24,600
I'll look for it

2609
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:26,000
so i clicked it in

2610
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,400
let me do a search

2611
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,400
it tells me right away

2612
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:33,400
The entire course is 45 hours

2613
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:36,400
A total of 56 talks about

2614
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:39,400
Blackbird Algo you typed

2615
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:41,400
But in fact, if you look closely, you will find

2616
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:43,400
Actually what's in it

2617
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:46,400
Is Blackbird Algo

2618
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,400
That's it

2619
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:49,400
I'm not actually

2620
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:51,400
from identified words

2621
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:53,400
word recognition

2622
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:54,400
I'm not looking for words

2623
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,400
Because I typed Blackbird Algo

2624
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:59,400
But what I found was Blackbird Algo

2625
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,560
But I found it by the sound

2626
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,960
Because this sound is exactly like this sound

2627
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,400
I'm looking for the sound

2628
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:11,080
He said you gotta find the BlackWare Algox

2629
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,960
A total of 56 occurrences

2630
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:16,520
Every time it's kind of like Google's page

2631
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:19,960
For example, this is the first time that this sentence is 8 seconds long

2632
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:23,800
It's in the slideshow on page 12 of Chapter 4

2633
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:26,720
You can just listen to these 8 seconds

2634
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:29,240
I want to hear the whole of this too

2635
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:31,000
etc.

2636
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,800
But if you want to listen for only 8 seconds

2637
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,160
probably can't hear anything

2638
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:35,240
Usually we recommend

2639
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:37,880
Should be listening to the whole slideshow

2640
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:40,040
Can I listen to the whole slideshow?

2641
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:41,320
he will tell me

2642
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:44,640
What are the key words of this slideshow

2643
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:47,120
With BlackWare Algox

2644
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,320
With BlackWare Algox

2645
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:48,920
Etc., etc

2646
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:51,880
this is his keyword

2647
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:53,920
So I can judge based on this

2648
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:55,720
do i listen to him

2649
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:58,120
Let's say I choose to say I'm coming to hear

2650
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:00,000
I can just click in

2651
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,560
I should basically get that page

2652
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,320
didn't you give it to me

2653
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,880
I'll try this and see if it works

2654
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:41,520
It doesn't have it. I'm sorry. I don't know why.

2655
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,320
let's pick another

2656
01:43:55,340 --> 01:43:57,140
I think there is something wrong with the network

2657
01:43:57,140 --> 01:43:59,700
With that, this is chapter 12

2658
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:00,640
Slideshow

2659
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:03,240
inside this one

2660
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:04,560
he told me

2661
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:05,760
this slide

2662
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:06,760
if you want to listen

2663
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:08,040
there are 22 minutes

2664
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:11,320
he's in the fourth place

2665
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:13,440
position in all

2666
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,480
The position of this one in the fourth one

2667
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:16,200
it's here

2668
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,120
you can listen to all

2669
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:19,440
You can also listen to gossip

2670
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:20,520
at the same time is important

2671
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:21,480
he told me

2672
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:24,680
what is his keyword

2673
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:26,720
Other keywords include EM

2674
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:28,440
Include the delta here

2675
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,880
Including backword, elkism, etc.

2676
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:33,680
Here it says

2677
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:35,480
above these are

2678
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:37,520
Keywords for this slideshow

2679
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:39,640
The bottom is with this keyword

2680
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:41,840
Related keywords are below

2681
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,760
This is not only in this page

2682
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:44,960
maybe the whole class

2683
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:47,080
Related keywords are below

2684
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:49,880
so i can go down there

2685
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:50,760
for example

2686
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,400
It should be down here

2687
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:54,640
Why can't I go down?

2688
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:57,680
how do i go down a bit

2689
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:10,400
Here are the positions where I want to show my keywords

2690
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:13,800
The screen is too small, right?

2691
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:19,800
ok, I have to use the explanation

2692
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:21,400
But actually I have it here

2693
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:23,200
For example, I know

2694
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,200
i can click

2695
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:25,800
for example

2696
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:29,800
What I want to see now is this keyword

2697
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,000
forward algorithm

2698
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,200
I just click

2699
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:34,600
That's right. That's it.

2700
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:35,600
it just told me

2701
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:38,000
you are looking for this keyword

2702
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,600
It first appears in Chapter 4 of the

2703
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:42,800
Chapter 12 Inside the same slice

2704
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:45,000
Second will appear in these

2705
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,600
so you need to know what it is

2706
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:48,400
if you don't know

2707
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:51,000
maybe start listening here

2708
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,600
then listen to these

2709
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:53,800
you talk about this now

2710
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:55,200
should know

2711
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:59,600
So this is the relationship between these keywords

2712
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,280
We should have drawn keywords into a picture

2713
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:04,440
But then no drawing

2714
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:05,960
Because this picture is too complicated

2715
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:08,680
So which keywords are related to each keyword

2716
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:10,200
We'll just write it right here

2717
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:12,320
For example, this is the Begger Algor

2718
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:13,720
if i click in

2719
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:15,040
I'll tell me

2720
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:18,640
This Begger Algor first appeared here

2721
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:21,080
and then second appear inside these

2722
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:23,320
I want to listen to the first time should start here

2723
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:24,680
I can go in from here

2724
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:26,280
then here comes this one

2725
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:28,200
I can just go in here and wait

2726
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:31,960
So I get a knowledge structure of the whole course

2727
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:37,200
Make it easier for users to find what you want

2728
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:37,560
good

2729
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:42,040
This is our second display

2730
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:48,200
third display

2731
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:57,040
we're talking about language learning

2732
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:00,000
What we're showing you is a virtual language tutor

2733
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,940
What about this we can imagine

2734
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:05,040
Language learning is increasingly important

2735
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:07,240
Because we are a globalized world

2736
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:11,540
Everyone needs a language other than his mother tongue to help him

2737
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:14,340
But when learning a language other than your mother tongue

2738
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:18,340
A bunch of additional teaching is the most effective but expensive

2739
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:20,540
So therefore we feel that

2740
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:23,540
You can let the computer take over the role of this pile of tutoring

2741
01:47:23,540 --> 01:47:25,340
Computers are not as good as humans

2742
01:47:25,340 --> 01:47:27,340
But the biggest advantage is

2743
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:30,340
It can be used countless times anytime, anywhere

2744
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:32,340
it doesn't get angry and doesn't rest

2745
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:35,340
hard work

2746
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:36,340
based on that

2747
01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:39,340
Computers can win

2748
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:42,340
Of course we are not saying that computers are going to replace teachers

2749
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:43,340
is impossible

2750
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:46,340
But a language teacher can use this software

2751
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:50,340
To teach a large group of students many classes at the same time

2752
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:52,340
We can also have online schools

2753
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:55,340
There are social networks for learners, etc.

2754
01:47:55,340 --> 01:47:59,340
Okay, so the one I'm showing you is Chinese from National Taiwan University.

2755
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,800
software for learning chinese

2756
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,600
teaching foreigners to learn Chinese

2757
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,200
what's in there

2758
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:07,200
The main content is

2759
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:10,000
Various most important communication functions

2760
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,760
including greetings

2761
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:12,440
ask

2762
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:13,800
invite, wait

2763
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:15,400
every communication function

2764
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:16,760
we have basic sentences

2765
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:18,400
different application scenarios

2766
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,400
For example, people, facts, places, etc.

2767
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:21,600
Then what

2768
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,400
It can contain all pronunciation units

2769
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:27,200
and this change in tone

2770
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:28,600
it can contain

2771
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:31,400
Most of the basic common words

2772
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:32,800
from easy to difficult

2773
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:33,400
Then what

2774
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:35,400
Consider actual language learning needs

2775
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:36,800
then this is

2776
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,200
Our Chinese teacher at the Liberal Arts College of National Taiwan University

2777
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:42,000
Help us design course content

2778
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:42,600
good

2779
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:43,000
what's down there

2780
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,800
I can show you this National Taiwan University Mandarin

2781
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,600
This is the Chinese website of National Taiwan University

2782
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:52,200
There are 12 units in total

2783
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:54,800
That is, the 12 communication functions are written here

2784
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:55,800
Let's take an example

2785
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:58,400
Let's look at this praise and response

2786
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:06,880
how do i order this

2787
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:10,280
ok

2788
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:11,960
then which one do i order

2789
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:13,240
this is

2790
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:15,920
then come back here

2791
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:20,960
ok good

2792
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,320
This is a compliment response

2793
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:25,760
We have the basic shape and the applied shape

2794
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:26,880
let's see one

2795
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,240
For example, in the basic form, there are

2796
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:31,400
e.g. grade response

2797
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:32,720
What is graded response?

2798
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:33,600
let's take a look

2799
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:37,200
when people praise

2800
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:39,120
Are you accepting compliments?

2801
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:40,920
Or accept compliments politely?

2802
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:42,960
Or reluctantly accept compliments?

2803
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,560
Still don't accept compliments?

2804
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:45,240
It will be all right

2805
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:48,280
This is to teach foreigners how to speak Chinese

2806
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:51,040
Then what do we mean by politely accepting compliments?

2807
01:49:58,240 --> 01:49:59,240
okay what about this time

2808
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
a good student

2809
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Thanks

2810
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
you are too polite

2811
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
you are such a good student

2812
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
where where

2813
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,000
you are such a good student

2814
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
I am over-flattered

2815
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,000
you are such a good student

2816
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Don't dare not dare

2817
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Well, this is what he said politely.

2818
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Four ways to accept compliments

2819
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
So

2820
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:34,000
shall i use this book first

2821
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
OK

2822
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
suppose i now

2823
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
do a single sentence exercise

2824
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
practice a single sentence

2825
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
this music is

2826
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
this music is

2827
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
well this is just now

2828
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,460
I can choose one of these eight sentences, for example,

2829
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:03,860
you are such a good student

2830
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:06,660
you are such a good student

2831
01:51:09,460 --> 01:51:11,600
you are such a good student

2832
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:19,060
did he go in

2833
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:22,980
i didn't open it

2834
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:25,000
ok ok do it again

2835
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:32,000
ok good

2836
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,500
Again

2837
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:36,500
you are such a good student

2838
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,500
you are such a good student

2839
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,500
what's wrong with this

2840
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:56,500
what's wrong with this

2841
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:59,500
what's wrong with this

2842
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,600
He doesn't listen to me today, it's really helpless

2843
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,400
Do you want to plug it in or not? Plug it in, right?

2844
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:26,000
Don't plug it in yet, right?

2845
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,400
Can't try it, it's already nine o'clock

2846
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:32,800
ok ok let's try again

2847
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:35,800
you are such a good student

2848
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:51,800
No, one more time

2849
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:58,800
It's not right now

2850
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:07,000
You said the mic was too big, my mic is too big

2851
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
OK

2852
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:15,000
you are such a good student

2853
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:20,000
you are such a good student

2854
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:25,000
You said I'm going to turn this off, right?

2855
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Is this the effect?

2856
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,000
in this way

2857
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:40,000
OK

2858
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:50,000
good start

2859
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:56,000
you are such a good student

2860
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,000
right

2861
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,000
ok this time it's ok

2862
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:12,640
Okay, he told me this sentence, the total score of what I just said is here

2863
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:16,600
My four scores are here, for example, the pronunciation is 85 points

2864
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:19,600
We can see why it is 85 points

2865
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:25,520
Then you will immediately discover what I just said, this is the pronunciation of each word

2866
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:28,520
All the coiled snakes I deliberately did not coil

2867
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:32,520
So he told me all the curly sounds were wrong

2868
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:37,520
These snake sounds are wrong. For example, this body only has 50 points.

2869
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:40,520
then this wait wait wait

2870
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:44,520
So on average I only have 100 points for everything else

2871
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,520
This is this only 50 points

2872
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:50,520
So my pronunciation is a total of 85 points

2873
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,520
So what if I don't know how to pronounce this snake sound?

2874
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:56,520
i can click

2875
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
ok listen

2876
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,800
This is the difference in the poses of my four faculties

2877
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:14,300
I can also click here

2878
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:16,300
OK I order this

2879
01:55:16,300 --> 01:55:19,800
He will tell me how to roll when you roll

2880
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:22,000
It's going to be rolled like this

2881
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,800
etc.

2882
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:29,800
OK, so this is 85 points

2883
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:33,800
We see that the pitch is the pitch

2884
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:35,800
Also how does the tone change

2885
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:37,800
I only have 52 points, what's going on?

2886
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:40,800
You'll see right away that I pronounced it as a whole on purpose.

2887
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:43,800
Turned into a third tone so he told you this isn't right

2888
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:47,800
And then when this becomes the third tone becomes the second tone

2889
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:49,800
You're all one so this is wrong too

2890
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:53,800
Just these two mistakes, so the result becomes only 52 points

2891
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:56,800
So what is this timing?

2892
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:00,800
This is the relative relationship between the length of each of my sounds

2893
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,000
How much is it different from the teacher's

2894
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Then what

2895
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
This emphasis is the accent

2896
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,000
That is to say

2897
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
every sound of me

2898
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
the size of the volume

2899
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:14,000
How much is it different from the teacher, etc.

2900
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,000
That's how much my total score is

2901
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
good

2902
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:21,000
so i can do a conversation exercise now

2903
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Thanks

2904
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,000
leave

2905
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Thanks

2906
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,000
you are too polite

2907
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,000
thank you for being so kind

2908
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
thank you for being so kind

2909
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,000
didn't go in

2910
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
I want

2911
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
This is the third demo

2912
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:20,000
I didn't make it but here we go

2913
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
I go back to the last

2914
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
We actually did one thing now

2915
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Another thing I'm actually doing right now is a conversation game

2916
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Because the one just now looked less fun

2917
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:52,000
So we hope to make a richer dialogue

2918
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Let people learn like playing games

2919
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Because the game is people love to eat

2920
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
So

2921
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
The way we think about it is to put

2922
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Make a number-like dialogue script

2923
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
then every love

2924
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Let's assume a situation like dining in a restaurant

2925
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
then let this

2926
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Each time there are many sentences to choose from

2927
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Then choose along the way

2928
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
different roads get different paths

2929
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
the practice times of pronunciation unit

2930
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
all different

2931
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
So the things a computer can do

2932
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,000
It is to replace users online at any time

2933
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
choose the best path

2934
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Wherever you say something bad

2935
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
We'll try to make it as fast as possible

2936
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,000
the most times, let it train well

2937
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
For example, it doesn't roll its tongue

2938
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
I just give it a lot of retroflex

2939
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Let it roll like hell, wait

2940
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
i can say something different

2941
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
to practice the same sound

2942
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Instead of practicing the same sentence over and over

2943
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Because we are going to practice repeatedly

2944
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,000
that good student good student

2945
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
I can now stop repeating

2946
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
I can use different in the dialog

2947
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
practice repeatedly

2948
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Haven't learned the pronunciation unit yet

2949
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
so i can show up early now

2950
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,440
Learn all the pronunciation units well in a short period of time

2951
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:06,160
For example

2952
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:08,600
This is the waiting and ordering part

2953
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:12,120
This one tries to say welcome, etc.

2954
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:12,960
Is there any place?

2955
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:14,320
you can say yes or no

2956
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:16,880
what if there is

2957
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:18,360
If not, how can we wait

2958
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:19,920
So this is a vertical structure

2959
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:21,760
what about us

2960
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:23,800
has a long dialogue script

2961
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:27,000
Start with a phone call

2962
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:31,400
Ordering, positioning, asking for directions until waiting for the table to order and serve

2963
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:33,080
until the farewell

2964
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:34,320
you can go back

2965
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:35,800
because after you turn around

2966
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:37,560
You have to eat the next meal after eating

2967
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:39,600
keep eating with different people

2968
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:41,600
Then every road can be different

2969
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:43,280
So if this tongue roll won't roll

2970
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:44,920
Just let it roll down and wait

2971
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:49,120
Ok, that's all for today

2972
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:50,120
One last word

2973
02:00:51,080 --> 02:00:52,000
open sesame

2974
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,120
This is an allusion to Alibaba

2975
02:00:54,120 --> 02:00:56,240
you guys know what it means to say

2976
02:00:56,280 --> 02:00:57,600
just talk

2977
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:59,720
The door that can open the treasure

2978
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:00,120
this is human

2979
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
man's dream since time immemorial

2980
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,000
So what we're going to talk about today is actually

2981
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:08,000
The Internet is the single most important treasure trove of knowledge in the future

2982
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
And the time to open the door to the treasure of knowledge with sound

2983
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
is getting closer

2984
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Of course many people will ask

2985
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
You use a machine to recognize life

2986
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
So what

2987
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
At best it is the same as the human ear

2988
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
In fact, you still have so many mistakes today

2989
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Can't compare with human ear

2990
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
But it does not matter

2991
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Because machines can process huge amounts of information

2992
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
But the machine can repeat

2993
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Repeat service anytime, anywhere

2994
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
These two points are the machine native human

2995
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
so what we have to do

2996
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,000
is how to take advantage of these strengths of the machine

2997
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Well though it has a place

2998
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,000
not so good

2999
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Should be pretty good too

3000
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
ok i want to end my speech today

3001
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
thank you

3002
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Thanks

3003
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Okay, thank you, Mr. Li, for your wonderful speech.

3004
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Although we have two full hours

3005
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:04,240
Let's discuss Q&A in about 10 minutes

3006
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:07,240
Do you have any questions?

3007
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:11,740
please

3008
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:14,240
Teacher, is this part of AI?

3009
02:02:14,240 --> 02:02:16,240
You can ask the microphone

3010
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:17,240
OK

3011
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:19,240
This is part of AI

3012
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:20,160
does it count

3013
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:21,200
Does it count as part of the AI?

3014
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:24,040
It actually depends on how AI people define AI

3015
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:25,240
sure

3016
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:29,240
But some people define the AI ​​key very

3017
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:31,240
Narrow's words

3018
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:33,240
Maybe he said it doesn't count

3019
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:35,240
I think this is fine

3020
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:37,240
Depends on see

3021
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:40,240
That should make it very clear what I'm talking about here.

3022
02:02:40,240 --> 02:02:43,240
is the signal with this voice

3023
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:46,240
Then I use a lot of math and a lot of programming

3024
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:48,240
find a way to do it

3025
02:02:48,240 --> 02:02:50,240
All the things audio signals can do

3026
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:53,240
Then it is very clear that the definition is like this

3027
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:55,240
Then the AI ​​person wants to say whether he is AI or not

3028
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:57,240
I think it's all right

3029
02:02:57,240 --> 02:02:58,240
OK

3030
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:00,240
good

3031
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:05,000
please teach me

3032
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:08,000
that today's report was wonderful

3033
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Thanks

3034
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,000
There is still an application to the theory of this congressman's identification

3035
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:16,000
But the current MPs recognize

3036
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,000
As if this is still not so tomorrow

3037
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,000
what is the most important bottleneck

3038
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:25,000
For example, you say that sesame seeds open the door

3039
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
But the flower sound of the sesame opening door is not accurate

3040
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Many flower sounds are inaccurate

3041
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,000
it won't open the door

3042
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Does this technically include software?

3043
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Is it possible to solve this problem already?

3044
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Can make it more general and friendly

3045
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Or are you suggesting that everyone go to the cloud for coordination?

3046
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Otherwise, there is no way for this congressman to identify

3047
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Thanks

3048
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
i want to make a point first

3049
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
It's just that you found out that something doesn't work

3050
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:55,000
It's not that my pronunciation is bad

3051
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
but a matter of contact

3052
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Or the problem that the signal is not coming in

3053
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
It's just that he can't recognize it himself

3054
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,000
the same

3055
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
This is about different accents for different people

3056
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
all these decades

3057
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Many people have done various researches

3058
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:13,000
there are many ways to handle this

3059
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Then you can also understand today

3060
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
There are indeed some systems that do a good job

3061
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:20,000
For example, there are some good features on mobile phones

3062
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Then he is indeed working with different people

3063
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:26,000
That means that in fact this

3064
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
adapt to different

3065
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,000
of different voices

3066
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
different accent thing

3067
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
In fact, there are already quite good solutions

3068
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
That's got pretty good results.

3069
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
only limited time today

3070
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I can't have this

3071
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,000
too much time

3072
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
no way to talk

3073
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:46,000
There are so many ideas to do this

3074
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
There are many effective ways

3075
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Allows different accents to be handled

3076
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
So many systems today

3077
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
You can see that they are all speaker independent

3078
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:58,000
He can listen to what different people are saying

3079
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,760
This should not be the main obstacle

3080
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:06,200
But the main obstacle should be to say

3081
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:09,160
Speech recognition will never be 100% correct

3082
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:10,960
always have a lot of mistakes

3083
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:14,600
We must live with those mistakes

3084
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:16,160
All the applications I just talked about

3085
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:18,960
In fact, they are all live with those mistakes

3086
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:19,760
For example

3087
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:21,960
when i do a summary

3088
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:24,560
I obviously let there be a typo in it, it doesn't matter

3089
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:26,720
Because as long as I get enough of it right

3090
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:28,160
i know what their point is

3091
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:29,520
I'll just grab it

3092
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:31,720
it's okay to be wrong

3093
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:33,440
I'm looking for the same thing

3094
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:34,640
if i'm looking for this

3095
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:36,840
That is, I can't be right about everything.

3096
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:40,120
But as long as I catch his stuff

3097
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:42,440
So all of our applications today are in this category

3098
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:45,440
Like if you have some product on your phone

3099
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:47,120
it can answer your questions

3100
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:47,840
also the same

3101
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:49,880
It is actually able to identify the inside

3102
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:51,440
important key to your important problem

3103
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:52,400
it caught

3104
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:54,880
It just knows how to answer

3105
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:57,680
Basically we all think in this direction

3106
02:05:57,680 --> 02:06:00,240
The real state today should be what I just said

3107
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,400
We can't be 100% right

3108
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:07,400
The situation will be different if the judgment is different

3109
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:09,900
if you talk on the street

3110
02:06:09,900 --> 02:06:11,900
This one has a lot of background noise

3111
02:06:11,900 --> 02:06:14,400
If I'm chatting with someone else

3112
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:15,800
So what this says

3113
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:18,400
It's not the same as the usual pronunciation, etc.

3114
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:20,000
will change

3115
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:23,600
That's why my error always happens

3116
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:25,800
This may be the biggest problem right now

3117
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:28,800
good

3118
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:30,800
yes

3119
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:32,800
you have to click

3120
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:39,800
Excuse me Mr. Li

3121
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:42,800
then in the western language

3122
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:43,800
They are phonetic characters

3123
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:46,800
Are there fewer obstacles in this regard?

3124
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:47,800
if it is like this

3125
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:49,800
If we can make Chinese also

3126
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:50,800
Pinyin as much as possible

3127
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:53,800
Can this obstacle be broken?

3128
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:57,800
Although some of this is pinyin

3129
02:06:57,800 --> 02:06:59,800
some are some this block

3130
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,320
But judging by the sound signal

3131
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:04,040
they look alike

3132
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:05,840
pretty much the same thing

3133
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:08,640
It's just that when I render with text

3134
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:10,840
What kind of text is used to present

3135
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:12,840
Then of course when this text appears

3136
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:15,560
its structure is different

3137
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:16,640
from this point of view

3138
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:19,520
We feel that doing Chinese is the same as doing English

3139
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:21,400
almost the same difficulty

3140
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:23,200
Then each has its own difficulties

3141
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:24,320
Chinese has a lot of difficulties

3142
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:25,440
just said

3143
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,560
English also has a lot of difficulties

3144
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:31,160
Today's Possible English Recognition

3145
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:32,600
better effect

3146
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:34,440
That's because many people do it

3147
02:07:34,440 --> 02:07:36,680
Then make great efforts

3148
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:39,200
The data they collect is much

3149
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:41,080
they use more

3150
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:42,360
say thousands of hours

3151
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:43,720
Tens of thousands of hours of data

3152
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:46,440
Thousands of computers connected to run

3153
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:48,600
then they can do better

3154
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:50,160
In fact, we feel

3155
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:52,040
The real difficulty is close

3156
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:54,000
Then all the problems are also close

3157
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,920
just different

3158
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,400
In fact, Chinese is also spelled out with a bunch of sounds.

3159
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:05,400
not much different from English

3160
02:08:05,400 --> 02:08:07,900
If we look at it from the level of sound

3161
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:11,200
The difference lies in the presentation of the text

3162
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:13,700
Of course, the text rendering is different and has a great impact

3163
02:08:13,700 --> 02:08:16,800
Because I'm going to use those words to help me train

3164
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:18,800
So why?

3165
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:21,800
For example, speaking Chinese because it is a square character

3166
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:24,800
So when I use text to render

3167
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:27,200
For example, a lot of words have the same pronunciation

3168
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:31,200
So what are these issues that are different

3169
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:35,200
So if the computer's CPU speeds up

3170
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:37,200
will it be better

3171
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:39,200
all of course

3172
02:08:39,200 --> 02:08:42,200
Today's speech technology has not reached any stage

3173
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:46,200
You can buy pretty good voice systems on the street

3174
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:48,200
Do it all on your phone

3175
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:50,200
how do those

3176
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:52,200
it uses a very large amount

3177
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:54,200
Mobile phone has a lot of data

3178
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:58,200
And a very large amount of calculations to train it and so on

3179
02:08:58,200 --> 02:09:00,200
Of course you're not pretending over there

3180
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,160
Those are not all things installed in the phone

3181
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:05,120
The answer to your question is in the cloud

3182
02:09:05,120 --> 02:09:07,520
that is to say

3183
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:10,000
Today's Today's Today's Cloud Technology

3184
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
can't get to this stage

3185
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,840
not the same as 20 years ago

3186
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:15,000
Of course technology has improved a lot

3187
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,800
It is also important because

3188
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:20,800
This computer is much faster

3189
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:22,320
a lot more data

3190
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:24,440
People put in a lot more effort

3191
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:26,000
these things add up

3192
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,600
Of course there are new technologies

3193
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:30,600
All of these have effects

3194
02:09:30,600 --> 02:09:32,600
Thanks

3195
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:35,600
two thousand

3196
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:36,600
Hello Mr. Li

3197
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:38,100
You spoke very well today

3198
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:41,300
I want to say that there is a commercial problem.

3199
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:43,600
It is about after the model is built

3200
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:45,600
Then this Chinese is actually Chinese

3201
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:48,300
A high percentage of the world

3202
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:50,600
If htc these are combined with this

3203
02:09:50,600 --> 02:09:53,800
There is a part about intelligent property

3204
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:54,600
put it some

3205
02:09:54,600 --> 02:09:55,600
Because many models

3206
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:56,600
not a system

3207
02:09:56,600 --> 02:09:58,600
If becomes a structure

3208
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:00,600
Then talk to the phone for advice

3209
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:05,080
Combined with this, it looks like Samsung has mobile phones that use Chinese.

3210
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:06,140
he stands here

3211
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:10,640
In fact, we can do a market share. Do you have the idea to share all these

3212
02:10:10,640 --> 02:10:11,520
no number i know

3213
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:14,840
The foreign series are also developing well

3214
02:10:15,360 --> 02:10:17,400
Some of the rooms in Taiwan are for tourism

3215
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:20,220
It does a good job on mobile as well. Some wins

3216
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:24,320
Is there anything in this plan because National Taiwan University is quite ahead?

3217
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:27,900
Make this market a share to balance in the mobile phone

3218
02:10:27,900 --> 02:10:32,500
Competitors above are able to cut a piece out here is one of mine

3219
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:35,060
I don't know what to think, no one will go this way

3220
02:10:35,580 --> 02:10:37,380
Taiwan University doesn't have the same idea, thank you

3221
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:39,680
i think it's a good idea

3222
02:10:39,940 --> 02:10:41,980
But someone needs to do these things

3223
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,340
Our technology at Taiwan University is very advanced, but

3224
02:10:46,580 --> 02:10:48,640
I can't do so many things by myself

3225
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:53,500
What I can do is to lead students to make friends with customers and do our research well.

3226
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:57,600
I'm already passed out from this so I'm unlikely to bother with anything else.

3227
02:10:57,900 --> 02:10:59,400
what about the same

3228
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,800
Certainly a very large market

3229
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:03,320
Then you also understand

3230
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:04,200
For example

3231
02:11:04,200 --> 02:11:06,520
Voice teams around the world today

3232
02:11:06,520 --> 02:11:07,680
all in Chinese

3233
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:09,600
It is not only our Chinese-speaking world

3234
02:11:09,600 --> 02:11:11,200
only do Chinese

3235
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:14,800
This one in North America, this one in Western Europe

3236
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:16,760
including east asia

3237
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:18,400
Everyone speaks Chinese

3238
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:19,520
you may know

3239
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:21,240
Department of Defense of the United States

3240
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:22,840
they invested a lot of money

3241
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:25,960
Buy thousands of computers for others

3242
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:28,320
Do a very good voice system

3243
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:30,520
it has two specified languages

3244
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:32,120
the first is arabic

3245
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:33,800
The second is Chinese

3246
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:37,240
This is a global program of the U.S. Department of Defense

3247
02:11:37,240 --> 02:11:39,120
you know why very clearly

3248
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:40,320
US Department of Defense looks

3249
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:41,960
its two enemies

3250
02:11:41,960 --> 02:11:43,040
the first is arabic

3251
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:45,240
The second is the person who speaks Chinese

3252
02:11:45,240 --> 02:11:47,080
so do chinese

3253
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:49,440
In fact, it is very common today

3254
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:53,160
then really have the most resources

3255
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:55,120
Can do the best Chinese

3256
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:58,440
That's actually a lot of teams around the world

3257
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:00,240
Then we in Taiwan can

3258
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,600
the Chinese part

3259
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:03,100
we are technically

3260
02:12:03,100 --> 02:12:04,040
Conceptually

3261
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:05,640
Definitely leading

3262
02:12:05,640 --> 02:12:06,940
but our resources

3263
02:12:06,940 --> 02:12:08,300
what can be done

3264
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:11,040
is now relatively limited

3265
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:12,480
of course

3266
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:14,040
If there is an industry

3267
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:15,900
want to do something

3268
02:12:15,900 --> 02:12:17,740
I think there is a chance

3269
02:12:17,740 --> 02:12:19,600
Someone needs to think about this

3270
02:12:19,600 --> 02:12:21,240
Someone come to organize

3271
02:12:21,240 --> 02:12:24,000
At this stage, it should be said that there is no

3272
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:24,940
sorry about that

3273
02:12:24,940 --> 02:12:27,600
this may disappoint you

3274
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:29,940
that last question

3275
02:12:29,940 --> 02:12:33,540
I am Zhu Hongyan from the Institute of Modern History

3276
02:12:33,540 --> 02:12:36,500
Just mentioned the American text

3277
02:12:36,500 --> 02:12:38,040
I didn't want to mention it

3278
02:12:38,040 --> 02:12:41,280
But it's basically Sanmou Huntington

3279
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:44,040
His Crash of Civilizations

3280
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:47,540
It basically assumes that these two

3281
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:50,500
Democracy has the biggest impact on America

3282
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:51,840
Crash may have generated

3283
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:53,380
He originally predicted that China

3284
02:12:53,380 --> 02:12:55,540
later became the number one in the Arab world

3285
02:12:55,540 --> 02:12:58,240
He actually wanted the order reversed.

3286
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:59,780
Then the question I want to ask is not this

3287
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,760
I feel very close

3288
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:03,760
because it's very hard

3289
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:04,960
very difficult

3290
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:06,800
so if it was me

3291
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:07,800
i really can't do it

3292
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:10,320
Then what I'm thinking is the other side

3293
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:11,600
is what you just mentioned

3294
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:13,520
is literal language

3295
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:15,200
seems to be text lead

3296
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:17,920
language is built on words

3297
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:19,360
and then to operate

3298
02:13:19,360 --> 02:13:21,960
if it is like this

3299
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:26,160
How to communicate with the whole system of book classification

3300
02:13:26,160 --> 02:13:27,600
all the key is

3301
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:29,800
Will it be faster to combine with book classification

3302
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:31,320
Thanks

3303
02:13:31,320 --> 02:13:32,000
Thanks

3304
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,720
we didn't think about it

3305
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:34,680
for us

3306
02:13:34,680 --> 02:13:36,040
language is language

3307
02:13:36,040 --> 02:13:38,320
languages ​​come in different forms

3308
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:40,440
then the sound is

3309
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:42,160
We are called spoken language

3310
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:44,160
is spoken language

3311
02:13:44,160 --> 02:13:46,080
The text is written language

3312
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:48,040
is written language

3313
02:13:48,040 --> 02:13:49,400
Then if it prints out

3314
02:13:49,400 --> 02:13:50,280
princess language

3315
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:51,640
printed language

3316
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:52,520
of course

3317
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:55,360
Operation still needs to be done through text

3318
02:13:55,360 --> 02:13:57,360
Then your operation must be through the text

3319
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:59,480
Text is the basis of language

3320
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,760
in today's case

3321
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:06,160
because we have to use these words

3322
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:08,880
or its phonetic symbols to mark these sounds

3323
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:10,080
know what it is

3324
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:11,480
what is it

3325
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:12,720
but the other way around

3326
02:14:12,720 --> 02:14:13,800
we can also imagine

3327
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:17,000
Actually this has some

3328
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:18,960
many languages ​​in the world

3329
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:20,440
it has no text at all

3330
02:14:20,440 --> 02:14:22,800
It can also exist directly

3331
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:24,640
Or rather it has only very simple

3332
02:14:24,640 --> 02:14:26,000
some first blood symbols

3333
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,960
its language exists

3334
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:29,160
So from that point of view

3335
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:32,920
Sound may be something that appeared earlier than words

3336
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:34,480
Said the operation is not working

3337
02:14:34,480 --> 02:14:35,880
sound does not work

3338
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:37,960
or through text

3339
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:40,320
It seems that our current experience is indeed the case

3340
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:41,960
That is to say, your voice must

3341
02:14:41,960 --> 02:14:44,200
label it to some extent

3342
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:47,040
Then I was able to do many things

3343
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:50,160
So that target can be text

3344
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:51,920
can be phonetic

3345
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:54,200
can be e.g. letters

3346
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:56,520
different situations have different situations

3347
02:14:56,520 --> 02:14:59,120
Then in our Chinese we speak square characters

3348
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:04,440
Western languages ​​have pinyin characters, which is the method of marking, etc.

3349
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:06,040
so it's a complicated thing

3350
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:08,160
Different language situations are different

3351
02:15:08,160 --> 02:15:09,920
So actually in the field of phonetics

3352
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:12,000
Almost every language we have has its own

3353
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:15,000
A whole bunch of teams working on their languages

3354
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:20,000
This is to do a good job of language today, at least eighty or ninety

3355
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:24,000
You are also kissing me teacher ask for advice

3356
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:25,520
can i ask a question

3357
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:27,640
That is to say, we are currently saying

3358
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:29,720
Let's say we're talking on the phone

3359
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:32,720
it can show text

3360
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:36,120
Will the field improve in the future?

3361
02:15:36,120 --> 02:15:40,120
We use human voice to speak to our mobile phones

3362
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:44,200
The mobile phone can also answer us with voice

3363
02:15:44,200 --> 02:15:45,040
Thanks

3364
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:46,200
this is of course possible

3365
02:15:46,200 --> 02:15:51,120
There should be some systems that do these things now

3366
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:53,480
because basically

3367
02:15:53,480 --> 02:15:56,600
It's easier for machines to talk

3368
02:15:56,600 --> 02:15:57,960
because it only needs to say one sentence

3369
02:15:57,960 --> 02:15:59,960
Just let others understand

3370
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,420
But you have to identify what this sentence is

3371
02:16:02,420 --> 02:16:03,620
is much harder

3372
02:16:03,620 --> 02:16:08,180
Because that sentence can say thousands of ways

3373
02:16:08,180 --> 02:16:12,380
So in fact, we actually have a lot of

3374
02:16:12,380 --> 02:16:14,340
e.g. dialogue system

3375
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:18,260
It's all machines talking to people

3376
02:16:18,260 --> 02:16:20,100
Even in the country, there are actually many

3377
02:16:20,100 --> 02:16:21,820
You may not have noticed

3378
02:16:21,820 --> 02:16:24,460
Sometimes, for example, the bank makes a phone call to say

3379
02:16:24,460 --> 02:16:26,700
what about your credit card

3380
02:16:26,700 --> 02:16:27,340
or something

3381
02:16:27,340 --> 02:16:30,980
Or what the election caller said

3382
02:16:30,980 --> 02:16:32,420
what happened to which candidate

3383
02:16:32,420 --> 02:16:33,620
He also said a few words to you

3384
02:16:33,620 --> 02:16:34,700
you thought he was real

3385
02:16:34,700 --> 02:16:36,380
Actually he is a machine

3386
02:16:36,380 --> 02:16:38,340
This actually exists

3387
02:16:38,340 --> 02:16:40,220
that sort of thing exists

3388
02:16:40,220 --> 02:16:45,380
That is to say, will it progress to the point of generalization in the future?

3389
02:16:45,380 --> 02:16:47,700
Universalization should not be a technical issue

3390
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:51,740
It's about having someone with the power of this business

3391
02:16:51,740 --> 02:16:52,940
to drive him

3392
02:16:52,940 --> 02:16:56,140
Let him really have enough people to do these things

3393
02:16:56,140 --> 02:16:58,140
that should be a chance

3394
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,300
Well, that's because of time

3395
02:17:02,300 --> 02:17:04,100
We thank you all for your participation

3396
02:17:04,100 --> 02:17:06,900
Thank you Professor Li Ningshan for your wonderful speech

3397
02:17:06,900 --> 02:17:07,700
Thanks

3398
02:17:07,700 --> 02:17:09,200
ok thank you thank you
