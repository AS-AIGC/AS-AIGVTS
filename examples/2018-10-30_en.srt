1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
good night everyone

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
speech is about to start

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Please set your phone to vibrate or elite

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
speech in progress

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Do not take photos with flash

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Thank you for your cooperation

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Ladies and gentlemen, hello everyone

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I am the deputy executive secretary of the Academic Advisory Council of Academia Sinica

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My name is Li Chaohuang

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So the poster was supposed to say

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Today is hosted by Vice President Zhou Meiyin

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But I'm sorry because the vice president

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Temporarily have this overseas itinerary

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
there is no way to get back

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So today I will help him host

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Then if you become a fan of Vice President Zhou again

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
first say sorry

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
so thank you all very much tonight

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Use this time after school to attend

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
our show

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Feast of Knowledge held by the Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, we have held this event many times

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Also accumulated a lot of interesting this

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Some articles on popular science

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, there are books outside our collection of articles from previous knowledge feasts

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So if you are interested, you can also buy it

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, what we are talking about today is actually quite a life-like technology.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Although it has a lot of basic research elements in it

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But the title is a word I think everyone has heard of Thermoelectric Technology

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That is simply how to convert heat into electricity

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Because we know a lot of this energy

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's used then last because the efficiency is not 100%

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So in the end it's all in the form of waste heat

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
into our rooms or into the atmosphere

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
or drain into the water

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Then these heats are okay

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,960
energy used

38
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,580
But, the problem is that it's not easy to collect

39
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,200
because it's going to be like all kinds of

40
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,580
That is to say, from high temperature to low temperature to diverge

41
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,640
So the development of thermoelectric technology is in

42
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,520
How can we improve energy efficiency now

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,400
how to improve the earth

44
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,900
Energy consumption is a very, very

45
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,900
Issues in the spotlight

46
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,700
Then we are very honored to have this today

47
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,180
Our Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, Academia Sinica

48
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,780
Director Chen Guixian is here to introduce this

49
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,580
very important technology

50
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,060
Then let me briefly introduce Director Chen Guixian

51
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,460
In fact, I've known him for probably over 20 years.

52
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,720
I don't know if there are 30 years

53
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,720
That's definitely over 20 years

54
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,700
Director Chen is

55
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,260
1981

56
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,420
Graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University in 1970

57
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,420
That

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,700
The BA of the big TV drama should have started a business at that time

59
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,500
It's right to be a tech upstart

60
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,000
However, Director Chen, because of his interest in science

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,500
so he went to harvard

62
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,000
Then earned a Ph.D. in 1989

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,500
Then he did this

64
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,000
Doing this man-made diamond research at that singular company

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Should be very promising

66
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't know why he changed his career again

67
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Director Chen is obviously quite persistent in academics

68
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Then in 1993 he returned to China to serve

69
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,500
joined the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences

70
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,000
The way from this research assistant to

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,500
Bitcoin researcher Na is also the director

72
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,000
So based on what I know of him

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I think Director Chen is one

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
a scientist forever

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
because when i knew him

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
he is still very young

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
very dark hair

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,160
Since then we have seen

79
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,160
At that time we will call him Mr. Chen

80
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,160
He just has always been able to offer his unique perspective on a variety of issues

81
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,660
And keep producing this very creative

82
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,160
And there are groundbreaking research results

83
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,160
Then I think in an environment like Academia Sinica

84
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:28,160
It is a place that complements such good scientists

85
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
We see how good scientists grow

86
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Then we see good scientists like this

87
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,160
Why did you go back and contribute to Academia Sinica?

88
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Director Chen is a very, very successful example

89
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,160
OK, then I'll introduce it here

90
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,160
Then we will hand over the time to Mr. Chen Gui, the director

91
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
please applaud everyone thank you

92
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,160
ok thank you host for this

93
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,160
flatter me

94
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,160
i think everyone knows

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He is special in several institutes

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We have the original institute, the mathematics institute and the astronomy institute

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's on the campus of National Taiwan University

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So this has

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Although I often come back to the courtyard for meetings

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But it's my first time to speak here

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The one that the host didn't introduce just now

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
In addition to graduating from the Department of Electrical Engineering, I went to the United States to study

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I think the more exciting part of life

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It was the years when I came back

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
At that time, our Taiwan happened to be from that

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
at the time of national transition

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There used to be only three TVs

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Then there are only seven newspapers

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
no more

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Then we have been going everywhere to demand that the party and government

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
have your own voice, your own what

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Why was there a so-called underground radio station for a while?

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
get it up from the ground

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
There are several home appliances in Taiwan now

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The radio station was founded by me

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And then also in public television

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Including Hakka TV

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But this is all related to today's theme

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Today's topic is

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What I'm going to tell you today is thermoelectric technology

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
heat into electricity or electricity into heat

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Turning electricity into heat is easy, right?

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's pass the current through any light bulb

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Cook it hot

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But it turns electricity into heat

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It can also convert electricity into energy

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
wait a minute i can introduce you

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's more difficult to get things down

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
English it is called

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,800
It's a direct flip with this thermoelectric

131
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,920
Then I want to tell you today

132
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,960
from some of its applications

133
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,360
it can be taken from the refrigerator at home

134
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,320
communication even to space

135
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,920
Some history of these past developments

136
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,240
the whole outline for today

137
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,360
right from the beginning of it

138
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,560
Motivation

139
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,720
how did it start

140
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,480
and then from its past development history

141
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,280
And then what we're going to bump into is to discuss

142
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,240
That is to say, what kind of difficulties did it encounter?

143
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,080
what chance

144
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,880
how to solve the difficulty

145
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,760
Everyone is still working hard

146
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,880
then to the conclusion

147
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,160
This was the beginning of everyone's idea

148
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,600
just want to say

149
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,000
we are in many

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,480
We are called ICE

151
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,000
internal combustion engine

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,240
After the Industrial Revolution, machines replaced ordinary animals or humans

153
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:16,080
The most important thing about the machine is that it never cares whether you are burning coal

154
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Either burn oil or burn natural gas

155
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:27,960
You call these oil charcoal or Fast or Fuel

156
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:35,200
These fossils that we live under the ground

157
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Fast or Fuel should be translated like this

158
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,600
You burn it to generate heat

159
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,200
Then after it is hot, it pushes the engine of the machine

160
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,400
But if you review it

161
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,200
You will find that a lot of heat is generated after you burn

162
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,920
But maybe only 25% 30% are actually used to do what you want to do

163
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,120
most of that

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
More than 60 percent of the heat in this part is wasted

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's hard for everyone to imagine

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
say you drive a car

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
or drive a motorcycle

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Actually all the same

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
look at that car

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
car it doesn't just say

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
it moves it smokes

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You need one more in your car

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
we call cooling water

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
our radiate

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
what is our chinese name

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
three

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
radiate is not

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
radiate is

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We have a cooled front of the car

180
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
cooling

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
water fragrance

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
water fragrance is

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Then why the perfume

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
it's your eyes that are too hot

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
so you have to cool it with water

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
since you are hot

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
why do you want to water it

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
cool it down drain it

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
isn't this a waste

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
In fact it means

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
After our gasoline goes to burn

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Mostly more than 60%

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
is scattered

194
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Only 30% of them help us work

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
the engine is running

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
so what

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
If we understand such a situation in the future

198
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
someone wants to say

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Wow, this one is still 60% hot

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
let's make good use of it

201
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
then i remember when i was young

202
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Sitting on the mountain in Nantou

203
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
they have that iron bullock cart

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
drive very slowly

205
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Iron ox carts also burn oil

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
see you diesel or something

207
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
that water

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Cool water burns hot

209
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So people will be in the cooling water

210
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
put some eggs in there

211
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
then at noon

212
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
only eggs to eat

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
that might be a

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Flying fish hot for reuse

215
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,440
After all, it is limited

216
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Most of the heat is still dissipated

217
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,240
so what

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,800
Many people wanted to say

219
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,040
If I take this heat and find a way to recycle it

220
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,480
That

221
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,840
Suppose you are sixty percent

222
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,280
It would be nice if my efficiency was even 10 percent

223
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,480
Then I can recycle 6% back

224
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,840
that's a lot

225
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,480
so what

226
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,360
a lot of research

227
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,840
that's just right

228
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,520
thermoelectric

229
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,440
because it's hot

230
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,000
right

231
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,440
If this heat is converted into electricity

232
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,680
that would be perfect

233
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,040
So it's not really a new topic

234
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,800
for example

235
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,600
This German BMW

236
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,800
we are bmw

237
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,680
they used to do

238
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,600
that is

239
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,600
thermoelectric material

240
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,120
put it on the face of this engine

241
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,640
or that exhaust pipe

242
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,600
exhaust pipe is hot

243
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,160
look at that motorcycle

244
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,640
The exhaust pipes have to be covered.

245
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,880
you accidentally get burned

246
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,200
You take this thermoelectric material

247
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,400
stick it on

248
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,760
it's ok

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,840
Save about 5% to 10% on gasoline

250
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,900
General Motors GM of America

251
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,020
It also added a 350 watt thermoelectric system later

252
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,280
it found that

253
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,900
The mileage of this car can be increased by 3%-4%

254
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,180
That

255
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,460
Although

256
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,060
3%-4% or this saves 5%-10%

257
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,340
sounds small

258
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,640
But what if you say

259
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,460
This every car we

260
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,560
The world produces tens of millions of cars every year

261
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,360
Save this on every car

262
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,900
In fact, it is still very impressive

263
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,440
That

264
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,800
Then we have to ask why there is no such thing in the cars we buy today.

265
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,580
we will come

266
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,640
Let's discuss

267
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,440
That's because such a

268
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,480
this thought

269
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,260
we are at

270
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,540
2012

271
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,640
A hospital of traditional Chinese medicine started a called

272
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,160
Thermoelectric Research Program

273
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,860
what about this plan

274
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,920
from

275
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,700
Fate

276
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,000
and the Institute of Physics

277
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,560
Fate Institute, except that I am the general convener

278
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,260
Our current deputy chief Wei Jinming

279
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,500
turn out to be

280
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,860
This one is Vice President Zhou Meiyin

281
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,660
After becoming the vice president

282
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,760
I just want to say that I don't want to ask for a referee

283
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,260
So he hastened to give

284
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,260
a young

285
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,420
Wei Jinming

286
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,220
our current deputy chief

287
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,420
in the physics institute

288
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,620
have

289
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,420
Chen Yangyuan

290
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,220
Also former Deputy Chief

291
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,220
Dr. Chen Yangyuan

292
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,220
And Dr. Wu Maokun

293
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,560
Academician Wu Maokun

294
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,060
There is another one who is our Indian nationality

295
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,900
called Sankar

296
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,020
Infection

297
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,300
sorry

298
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,220
That

299
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,920
Speaking of

300
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Dr. Chen Yangyuan, of course, everyone should

301
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He's no stranger, he's more senior than me

302
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,000
About ten years ago, I started to do research on thermoelectricity

303
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's also because of him that I dare to say

304
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Alright then let's get the House team together

305
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Academician Wu Zhaokun, you don’t need my introduction

306
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
He became very famous because of these things in the Ministry of Education a while ago.

307
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
In fact he was before the Ministry of Education, he was actually more famous

308
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Everyone knows this superconductor

309
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
We have a scientific community, we talk about high-temperature superconductivity

310
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That is to say, the previous superconductivity had to reach almost this absolute zero.

311
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Ten degrees below absolute zero will produce superconductivity anyway

312
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Academician Wu Zhaokun and his teacher Zhu Jinwu

313
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
In the United States, Houston at that time

314
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
One material they discovered is called YBCO

315
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
four elements together

316
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Then raise the temperature of this superconductor to an absolute temperature of 90 degrees

317
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If I remember correctly, I just know

318
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That temperature is higher than the temperature of liquid nitrogen

319
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That was incredible, a very big breakthrough

320
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Because in the laboratory, laying eggs is like drinking boiled water

321
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That is to say, it is actually possible to obtain

322
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Meaning you cool it below the temperature of a fetal egg

323
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
superconductivity can be achieved, and a lot of research can be done

324
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Can save a lot of energy

325
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So Wu Maohui Academy is his contribution

326
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
his understanding of the material

327
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This experience provides a very important support for our team

328
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:17,000
In addition to this, Professor Zhou Fangzheng of National Taiwan University Lingtai Center is a Crystal Grower

329
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Many thermoelectric materials rely on gold

330
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Professor Zhang Zhiwei is very experienced in the analysis of a structure of Nimi and his heat conduction telecommunications

331
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:43,000
In the end, Xie Wenbin from the Institute of Earth Sciences started to be a thermal teacher and assistant researcher. He should have given birth recently, right?

332
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He's been doing really well lately and he's really good at measuring heat conduction.

333
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We formed such a team, of course except for this account

334
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
In fact, there are many involved behind the scenes

335
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
For example, Professor Lin Lixiong present here

336
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Director of the Front Desk Da Ning Tai Center

337
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
also my other half

338
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
He's actually been involved in this project all along.

339
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Just saying the name doesn't stand here

340
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I often say

341
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I myself was born to learn electrical engineering

342
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So it is clearer about electricity

343
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
familiar with light

344
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But when it comes to materials

345
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
When you come across the structure of this material

346
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
you put it up

347
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
you turn it

348
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
what is its symmetry

349
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
get this done

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I usually just get dizzy

351
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But luckily when I get sleepy

352
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I give it to my wife

353
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
She can help me out soon

354
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
say how it should be

355
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So although her name is not posted here

356
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I especially acknowledge her

357
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Okay, let's go back to what thermoelectricity is. Simply put, you have a heat, and then, in the process of heat dissipation, it will generate electricity at the same time.

358
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:29,500
As for this thing, about two hundred years ago, this Sebeck discovered such a phenomenon.

359
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:48,500
In fact, if you look at his original picture, he found that when he put a metal material through one end and heated it, the heat will flow to the other end.

360
00:18:49,000 --> 00:19:00,000
At the same time, he found out that he put one, which is similar to a pointer, the pointer is here, and found that the pointer can move, and then felt very, very...

361
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,120
Very surprised

362
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,800
Then he thought

363
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,800
This magnetic field is caused by heat

364
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,200
creates a magnetic field

365
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,800
Not long after that it was confirmed that

366
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,400
In fact, his original idea was wrong.

367
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,600
It's because after the heat flow

368
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,920
He will also drive a current

369
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,200
We know this current

370
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,000
Electricity and magnetism are closely related

371
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,200
because of current

372
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,400
So the generated magnetic field deflects the pointer

373
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,600
so what

374
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,800
We call this thing C-Back Effect

375
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,400
discovered 200 years ago

376
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,600
Then such an Effect

377
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,200
In fact if you are a material

378
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,000
it can also

379
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,200
But why do we often draw two

380
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,800
We'll tell you later

381
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,000
Why do they usually come in pairs?

382
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It will be more efficient

383
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
then say another

384
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
After the discovery of the thermoelectric effect

385
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
it's been ten years

386
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Another French scientist named Patel

387
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
he found out

388
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
If I am in certain materials

389
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
After I turned it on

390
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
he found out

391
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
one end can get very hot

392
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
even

393
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
one end can get very cold

394
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
it's upside down

395
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
that is

396
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Because of the cold temperature difference

397
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
T degree difference so generate electricity

398
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
what about here

399
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
he means

400
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
If I use current

401
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Make a voltage to make it generate a current

402
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
One end of the material found to be hot

403
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
the other end will get cold

404
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
At first

405
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
these discoveries

406
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
caused a lot

407
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
everyone's attention

408
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Research

409
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So what about this thing?

410
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
In our general textbooks, there are

411
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Wait until later this is called Tomson

412
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:20,000
This William Thompson he just came to know about it

413
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
In fact, these two things are two sides of the same coin.

414
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's the same thing upside down

415
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I have T degrees of temperature and I can generate electricity

416
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Upside down I push it back with electricity

417
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Electricity pushes it back and I can generate heat

418
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
or a difference in temperature

419
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
is the same thing

420
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It even takes the two coefficients

421
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It is CBF and PADF

422
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Association between two coefficients

423
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
express it mathematically

424
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,280
that is a very important contribution

425
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,260
Then this William Thompson

426
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,740
He was later dubbed the British

427
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,780
Lore Kevin

428
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,820
I'm curious about this

429
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,500
Strange, his name is Thompson

430
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,100
Then why is it called Kevin

431
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,600
Everyone knows Lore

432
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,020
In England they have this class of different nobility

433
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,000
some what sir

434
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,020
some monkey prince or something

435
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,380
Then he was named Lore Kevin

436
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,100
should have made a great contribution

437
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,420
Then why is it called Kevin

438
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,440
If I were Lore Thompson

439
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,520
Why Lore Kevin

440
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,520
In fact

441
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,100
I think his contribution

442
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,200
Another contribution is even greater

443
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,800
He pushed it down and said

444
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,200
have a temperature

445
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
called the absolute temperature absolute zero

446
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Wow, this is actually today

447
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It is not easy for ordinary guests to think about this

448
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
the idea we know

449
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
All objects have a certain temperature

450
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Touch our heads, do you have a fever today?

451
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Or this cold snap is coming, it's cold outside

452
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Slowly humans figured out and said

453
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
With the concept of temperature, there can be heat

454
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Right? Well, then what?

455
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
There is a scientist who should be from Denmark or Sweden

456
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Called Selces

457
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
He put the water

458
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
The freezing temperature is the same as the boiling temperature of water

459
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Eight hundred and one hundred grid

460
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
hundredths

461
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,860
that is our facility today

462
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,100
Facility temperature

463
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,340
I remember going to

464
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,500
when denmark

465
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,620
there is one

466
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,820
it was a museum

467
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,420
still in front of a train station

468
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,660
Huanong has a very large thermometer

469
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,620
Then there is DoC not DoF

470
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,220
that's why

471
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,060
he just wants

472
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,220
Xiu said you have a look

473
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,820
This Sales is someone from their country

474
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,860
That

475
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,180
Originally set the temperature

476
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,580
Use a few degrees C facility a few degrees

477
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,260
Then turn this temperature into 100 divisions

478
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:42,180
really full

479
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,580
Everyone is using it everyday

480
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,380
but

481
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,020
from that facility

482
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,580
to what we call absolute temperature

483
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,700
this is not easy

484
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,820
But it's not easy

485
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,300
that is

486
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,460
If we take a

487
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
material or even biological activity

488
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I don't know that no one knew or understood him back then

489
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
When he got this Tomson

490
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That is to say, you put a certain

491
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Look at the vibration of atoms or what kind of

492
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
He transformed this activity into a coordinate with temperature

493
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Then this activity becomes smaller and smaller

494
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
If you push to a certain activity when it is as small as 0

495
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
He found out that the temperature was -273.16 degrees

496
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
From that time onwards

497
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
There is a temperature called absolute zero

498
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
at that temperature

499
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
all things will stand still

500
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,500
All creatures are lifeless

501
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,500
All objects stop when they are at absolute latitude

502
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
OK

503
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
so from this

504
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,500
it got this calvin

505
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,500
is the absolute temperature

506
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,500
That's why it was knighted

507
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Law, didn't I say Law is called Jazz?

508
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's a knighthood, okay?

509
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,500
this is really important

510
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,000
Although it is not directly related to today's hot spots

511
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,500
That absolute temperature

512
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
You seem to say fate

513
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,000
What about Fate, we have four groups

514
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
One of them is called AMO

515
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Atomic Molecular and Optics

516
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
What about this group?

517
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,000
have a very special plan

518
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
that is

519
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,740
This atom or molecule, has been cooling energy

520
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,800
How cold can it be?

521
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,940
You said absolute temperature, absolute zero

522
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,340
In fact, no one has ever reached absolute zero.

523
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,540
it's hard

524
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:23,160
That's all right, then use various methods to cool it under liquid nitrogen

525
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,660
liquid liquid nitrogen, and even colder, liquid hydrogen

526
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,620
not enough, colder, liquid helium

527
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,060
Liquid helium depends on which kind of helium

528
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,860
It's two or three degrees below absolute temperature

529
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,000
ok , not cold enough

530
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
There is a Nobel laureate named Zhu Liwen

531
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,360
He just uses a laser

532
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:55,200
Take this atomic molecule and make it move smaller and smaller

533
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,000
then reached a few

534
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,640
Our name is Milly Kevin

535
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,020
minus 3 degrees absolute temperature

536
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,580
wow smaller

537
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,360
But actually that is not enough

538
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,820
early in science

539
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,060
Derivation There is a thing called Bose Einstein

540
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,660
Condensation Einstein

541
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,560
everyone knows

542
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,800
Another one is from India

543
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,900
Scientists call Bose VOSE

544
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,000
They theoretically deduce that

545
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,460
you take this substance

546
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,800
to a certain extent

547
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,300
it becomes another state

548
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,000
we just know

549
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
A substance is either a gas or a liquid

550
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,800
otherwise solid state

551
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,400
but he said no

552
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,100
At that point it was called Bose Einstein

553
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,100
The Condensation is another completely

554
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,800
status no one has seen

555
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,900
Theoretical derivation

556
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Seventy or eighty years later

557
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
It was proved experimentally that

558
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
really called BEC

559
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
This Bose Einstein Matter Exists

560
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
that's a hot topic

561
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
so what

562
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
This BEC

563
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
just close to

564
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
For example, rich six

565
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
called Microkevin

566
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Now the laboratory can do

567
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Nano-Calvin is even lower

568
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It's very, very close to absolute zero.

569
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
so what

570
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
This conception of light from temperature

571
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
to absolute temperature

572
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
That's what we just talked about

573
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
you can approach

574
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
How close to absolute zero

575
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
What about this matter?

576
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
actually

577
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
is in what we call

578
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,300
Cold science, it is very cold

579
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,500
How to do this very very cold low temperature

580
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
ok then we come back

581
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:14,500
So, this Tomson has made great contributions

582
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,000
As for thermoelectricity, he combined two phenomena

583
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,500
string it up

584
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,000
We call this thermoelectric material two sides of one body

585
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
In fact, we will introduce two phenomena in a moment.

586
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
it all works

587
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Well, I didn't introduce this to you

588
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
A man named Gustav Magnus

589
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It is to combine materials, different materials

590
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
do some experiments like

591
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
In the end, it turns out that what we call

592
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
thermocouple

593
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
We are often in the laboratory, in some laboratories that do physics

594
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
you want a high temperature

595
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
this one thousand degrees

596
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Some are four Baidu

597
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
then you have some zero degrees

598
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,240
200 degrees, how to measure these temperatures

599
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,840
The most common is to use two different metals

600
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,140
then chain it together

601
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,600
it will get a potential difference

602
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,940
That potential difference is related to its temperature

603
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,980
So, that thing

604
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,200
This phenomenon is actually related to the material

605
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,140
its nature is related

606
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,580
good

607
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,580
come again, this one

608
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,760
called Yof

609
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:39,480
what about yofy , he ' s a soviet

610
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
What about him

611
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,880
around 1900

612
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,860
he just said

613
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,880
use a pair

614
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,120
First, he uses semiconductor

615
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,720
Two sides use a pair, we call P type and N type

616
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,600
Inside, on the semiconductor surface, there are some positive charges on it.

617
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,600
There is a kind of charge that replaces more negative charges

618
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,100
He said, put two times and two times in pairs

619
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,800
it can get the highest efficiency

620
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,800
This is also very important, so you see

621
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,800
the soviet stamp

622
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,800
This is 1980, and that was the Soviet Union

623
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Soviet Union stamps, there it is

624
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,800
That's not the only way, if everyone goes

625
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,800
That St. Petersburg, let me see, raise your hand if you have been to Russia

626
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Many people should have been there, Russia

627
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
doesn't he? no, don't be so polite

628
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Have you ever been to St. Petersburg? Raise your hand

629
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
How many have been

630
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,800
you went to st petersburg again

631
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Of course you went to see that so-and-so, that so-and-so East Palace in Kaiserling, right?

632
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
wow that's beautiful isn't it

633
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
What about St. Petersburg?

634
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The most important scientific research unit

635
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's called YORF Institute

636
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
is to commemorate it with its name

637
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
then it's on the thermoelectric

638
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
it says on the first side it says

639
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
This semiconductor is better than this metal material

640
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
or other materials or insulating materials

641
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Suitable

642
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
this is very important

643
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
second it says

644
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
The material is the best

645
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
have a pair

646
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
One is P-type material

647
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The other one is N-type material

648
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
One is a positively charged material

649
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
One is a negatively charged material

650
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
make it paired later

651
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
everyone can watch

652
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
its electricity

653
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It can run like this

654
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So electricity is connected in series

655
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
two things in series

656
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
strung together these two are strung together

657
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
but it's hot

658
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
hot here is hot

659
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
here is can

660
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
heat is electricity

661
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,600
This is very strange, our...

662
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:08,840
It is not easy for you to think that there is a structure that can make heat and electricity

663
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,360
let one be in series, one patient

664
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,160
Then if it is changed in this way, its efficiency can reach the highest

665
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,400
So why do we often have a lot of materials?

666
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,200
Thermoelectric materials wait for everyone to see

667
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,040
It's all one-on-one

668
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,000
This thing is at the back

669
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,760
Let me take a look, okay, let me tell you first

670
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,440
Most of the current thermoelectric materials look like this

671
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,640
It looks like this one by one

672
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,800
Let's call Array, get it up

673
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,440
Well, among them, they are all in pairs, pairs, pairs, pairs

674
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,440
can achieve the highest efficiency

675
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,040
So here I have brought some materials

676
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,160
It's an oil price company called Malo

677
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,040
Take a look and let you pass it on

678
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,840
What does this material look like?

679
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,340
OK

680
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,340
Just look at it and get a feeling

681
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:14,340
What about this material?

682
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:21,840
Around the 1940s and 1950s

683
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,440
Very

684
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,440
Then it became very popular

685
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,440
whether it is the soviet union

686
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,280
Regardless of the United States, etc. are actively researching

687
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,280
For example, the earliest product

688
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,280
Just a thermoelectric with an oil lamp

689
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,280
light up

690
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,280
Then this heat goes to generate electricity

691
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,280
This electricity to power a radio

692
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,280
Your radio uses its power

693
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,280
then i don't have a radio today

694
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,280
I brought this thing for everyone to see

695
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,280
this is also a

696
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,120
put a candle underneath

697
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,160
In the future, one side of the thermoelectric material will be heated.

698
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,060
after heating

699
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,420
this

700
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,500
You can see the LED lights

701
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,040
that will be bright

702
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,560
That

703
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,160
Of course everyone will feel very bored, right?

704
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,200
Then you already have candles and you need to light them again

705
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,260
What do you do with that LED?

706
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,260
right

707
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,800
then you are not this

708
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,600
what are we going to do

709
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,900
Your word is Diago Gipson

710
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,700
Take the monkey to the mountain

711
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,720
what to do

712
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,520
but

713
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,820
if one day

714
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,660
You're going to climb a mountain and you're suddenly stuck in the mountain

715
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,700
Then your mobile phone has been used

716
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,500
This is out of power

717
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,320
Then you asked to save him and found that

718
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,340
this

719
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,360
No electricity

720
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,420
if there is this

721
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,220
he can save your life

722
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,540
Of course it's more than that. It's just a

723
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,320
An example would be to say

724
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,380
your simple one

725
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,860
oil lamp

726
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
How is it possible to generate electricity

727
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Then wait a minute, this is over, everyone can take a look

728
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So, at that time

729
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
either the soviet union

730
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Many people in the United States are concerned about this thermoelectric material

731
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
have high dreams

732
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
What dream? That is to say, if the material efficiency is high

733
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
then i don't need that internal combustion engine, i don't need that engine

734
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
That engine though we have it in every car, right?

735
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
That car is noisy, you know that engine

736
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It explodes every time, go push this spin of yours

737
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
If this efficiency is high enough

738
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
then you burn it up and heat it up

739
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,460
It turns into electricity, no noise, very stable

740
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:13,020
So at that time, many countries were developing this thermal power

741
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:17,160
I want to say that one day it will really become a mainstream

742
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,560
Then such an effort lasted until about the 1970s

743
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,220
In the end, I found out that it doesn't seem to be true.

744
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:31,620
Let's take a look at this in 1960 when

745
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,020
The first paper 1954

746
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,760
This one is called Gullsmith

747
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,700
He used a material called Bismuth Terrarium

748
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,940
Is Geochem B

749
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,980
This material is now turned into a commercial thermoelectric material

750
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,740
is the most widely used

751
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,300
This Gullsmith is number one

752
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
One cools it with thermoelectric method to cool it

753
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Cool the material down to sub-zero

754
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
zero degrees is of course a big milestone

755
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So this establishes a milestone

756
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Of course Ghost Miss was originally called Chicago

757
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Has many contributions to thermoelectricity including writing this book

758
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
It doesn't just write a book, it just lists a

759
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Recently, after getting older, it recently moved to Australia

760
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's a very well-known figure in the thermoelectric community

761
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I've just covered most of the material

762
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Now pass it down for everyone to see, it looks like this

763
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Then it depends on your thickness and height

764
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
If you want to generate electricity, the hot and cold

765
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
There must be a temperature difference

766
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
The bigger the temperature difference, the better

767
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,500
so what

768
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,700
If you are too thin

769
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,700
You can't get it up if you have a temperature difference

770
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,500
so generally

771
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,300
it also has a certain distance

772
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,300
so it can't be made too thin

773
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,300
but if you want to cool down

774
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,100
it will be easier

775
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,300
cool down

776
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,700
this can be done

777
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,300
even do it with thin film

778
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,300
Then everyone can see

779
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,000
Then what

780
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,300
There is another important

781
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,700
there are two people

782
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,700
This is Cody and Abel

783
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,900
where are they

784
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,900
in the 1960s

785
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,500
he was the first to propose

786
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,000
用Silicon Germanium

787
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,900
this fold

788
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,500
Folding system or refinement

789
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,500
inside the table table

790
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,900
It is folded tin sign from carbon series

791
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,900
If you were tabled when you were a child

792
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,100
it folds the tie

793
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,000
get it together

794
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,300
become a

795
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,200
this alloy

796
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,000
That

797
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,100
they figured it out

798
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,440
This material can be made into a good thermoelectric material

799
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:14,040
Sure enough, the details about Silicon Jumenium

800
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:22,600
The first one it can go from room temperature of 300 to 1100 degrees K

801
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,200
It is stable at very high temperatures

802
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,480
The second more important thing is that it has a radioactive element

803
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,320
called Putonium

804
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,920
This Putonium it's dangerous

805
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,640
After our nuclear power plant produces nuclear power

806
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,000
One of its products is this thing

807
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
That's because of the radioactive elements in this thing

808
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,880
Radiation is still strong

809
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,520
So we don't know what to do with the nuclear waste

810
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,440
And look at this half-life of 24,000 years

811
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,280
After it was produced, you said it was not good and you left it

812
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,280
Just leave it for a long time

813
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,340
Is it okay? It will be reduced to half after 24,000 years

814
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,880
So why does everyone have such a headache about nuclear waste?

815
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:14,040
But, it doesn't mean that this material is useless

816
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,760
it this

817
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,200
Because it will always release the medium fat and alpha

818
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,700
this particle

819
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,800
It will generate a lot of heat when it hits this metal

820
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,460
Then it puts out the heat of this radioactive element

821
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,400
become hot

822
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,300
To provide silicon germanium to do thermoelectricity to generate electricity

823
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:40,800
Then what

824
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,300
This power supply made in this way

825
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,500
Provided a lot of Apollo this pioneer

826
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,000
The Pioneer seems to have exploded during Longe

827
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,900
Then vacuum, Voyager, Galaxia, Jellilie, etc.

828
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,900
Many, many spaceships all use

829
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
This method means that everyone can see

830
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It's something, it's a Voyager

831
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
its this spaceship

832
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
In addition to all kinds of

833
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Cameras, other than communication equipment

834
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
where its power

835
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
From this one, it's called RTG

836
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
RadioIsotope, just that Plutonium

837
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's called the Confidence Element, and then what?

838
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Somoelectric is Silicon Dominium

839
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and then generate electricity

840
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Then its detailed structure looks like this

841
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I don't think I need to explain it to you carefully.

842
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
That is to say, it basically takes Putonium

843
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Put this on, it's hot, it's hot

844
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
This element is placed here, and after hitting the surface

845
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
it takes heat, puts it here, and pours

846
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Then through thermoelectric materials, and finally

847
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Pass the electricity, this one out

848
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Of course, many people will wonder

849
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Our normal spacecraft don't need this

850
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You can use solar panels, right?

851
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
while outer space is running

852
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
The sun is stronger than the surface of the earth

853
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
then why do you need this

854
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
In fact, ordinary spaceships

855
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
In fact, it would be better to use solar panels

856
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
But there are many special uses

857
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Come and see everyone

858
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
For example, this is the Voyager sailing plus

859
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
it rises from the earth

860
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
around 1776

861
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
There are two Voyager 1 and Voyager 2

862
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
two nautical pluses

863
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
slippery as it wanders

864
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,080
Rocket ascends to outer space

865
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,600
and start orbiting the earth

866
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,440
centripetal force

867
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,080
just kept going around there

868
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,040
around to a certain extent

869
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,640
it gives a little motivation

870
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,840
then from the earth

871
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,800
pull this is a

872
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,840
Jupiter

873
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,960
to the next planet

874
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,640
and go around to it over there

875
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,800
All the pictures to be probed have been taken

876
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,360
then give it a little more motivation

877
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,960
It ran to the next one to Saturn

878
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,800
even what

879
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,560
Uranus or Minwang

880
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,000
ancestor star

881
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,840
then to Uranus

882
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,960
Jupiter goes down one by one

883
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,760
It uses a very clever

884
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,840
a physical method

885
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,600
use very little energy

886
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,560
just use its centrifugal force

887
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,040
it goes from one to one to one

888
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,280
and put the whole sun

889
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Visit all these stars

890
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Even I remember when there were several stars with their moons

891
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
didn't know before

892
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Because this Voyager went to shoot very clearly

893
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
such a contribution

894
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Everyone should know that you are on Earth

895
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
you might be on mars

896
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
strong sunlight

897
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
No problem with solar version

898
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
but

899
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
you are farther away

900
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
to Saturn

901
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
to Jupiter

902
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
too far from the sun

903
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
not enough sunlight

904
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Provide the solar energy you want

905
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
so what

906
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
why it needs to be used

907
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
radioactive elements

908
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Then come to provide power

909
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
that's how it came

910
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
then everyone can watch

911
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
because it is radioactive

912
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
in the process of claiming

913
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
all

914
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
to be in this

915
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
All the space suits in this Clean Room have to be worn

916
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Do you know why? Why is it needed?

917
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Just put it back on

918
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
There is no need for the auxiliary line, there is no way to block this

919
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Auxiliary line, you have to wear Qianyi

920
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
why is this? you need to know

921
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
You go take an X-ray

922
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Tell you how many times I take a photo

923
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
how many doses is it right

924
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Then you said, it’s best not to take more than a few times a year

925
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Too many security photos are not good

926
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
everybody knows

927
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
But today if you say

928
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
we have a composite

929
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
or radial rebar

930
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
if one day

931
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
you accidentally sucked into your body

932
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Then the radioactive substance stays in your body

933
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
It's like an X-ray inside a body

934
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I've been taking photos with you

935
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,280
then you are very very dangerous

936
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,280
Because if you suck it in, you can't get it out

937
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,400
and stay inside you

938
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,320
it goes on and on

939
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,440
within its half-period

940
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,480
it just keeps emitting this radiation

941
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,520
so it's very dangerous

942
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,440
so what

943
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,920
Absolutely no radiation pollution

944
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,120
Or it's the same when you go to a nuclear power plant

945
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:29,000
You can't let radioactive material get into your body

946
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
good

947
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,520
this is a

948
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,080
this nautical plus spaceship

949
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,360
this person is special

950
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,840
His name is Ed Stone

951
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,480
He was the host of the project

952
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,720
NASA

953
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,280
When Launch Voyager

954
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,720
his host

955
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,240
that was very successful

956
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,240
Everyone can think of AZ

957
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,760
I just told you

958
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,600
Skip from planet to planet Skip from planet to planet

959
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:08,700
Walk all the stars of the sun

960
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:13,200
Many people will ask him

961
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,200
What about going to the last one?

962
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,200
Does anyone know

963
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,200
What is the one that went the furthest after the detection?

964
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,200
star?

965
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,200
after that

966
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,200
No

967
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,200
What are the hundreds of millions of planets in the universe afraid of?

968
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,200
Just go to the next planet after this

969
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,200
Does anyone know

970
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,200
where is he going

971
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,200
Next target

972
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,200
Does anyone know

973
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,200
Guess

974
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,200
There are so many planets in the universe

975
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,200
Now, of course, the light pollution of the special style is relatively tight.

976
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,400
If you go for diplomacy, take a look

977
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,700
Wow, that star is too many to count

978
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,500
I went back to my home in Nantou a while ago

979
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,500
come with some relatives

980
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,100
Wow, they looked at it and said wow, why is this

981
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,000
There are so many stars in Nantou

982
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,000
and then the terrible

983
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,400
have a child like this

984
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,700
She clicked on this phone or that app

985
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,100
She calls out every star

986
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,800
OK now just say

987
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,900
Your GPS knows where your location is

988
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,300
The second you know when your date is

989
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,300
Every star on her phone

990
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,900
Correspond to the stars in your sky one by one

991
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,300
We used to get half a day there

992
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,000
Oh, which one is the Big Dipper?

993
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,300
oh which one is the star

994
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,400
right now no more

995
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,500
Take it out and pair it up

996
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,100
Oh this is her this is her

997
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,600
This kid seems to be very happy now

998
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,100
won't probably lose some of the fun too

999
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:59,400
what to say

1000
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,440
This nautical plus to the last star star

1001
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,560
It's actually been, maybe three or four years ago

1002
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,560
He ran from the earth for forty years

1003
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:18,560
Then of course you can design him and see how long he goes around

1004
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:22,060
But it takes years to go between each star

1005
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:24,560
OK, run like this

1006
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,560
ok , to the back

1007
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:33,560
Of course he can wait and say, then I'll go out

1008
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:38,060
It may take many years to wait, and it is possible to go to the next planet

1009
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:41,060
But maybe two or three hundred years later

1010
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:45,560
Do you have the impression that we are talking about the distance between the stars

1011
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:50,560
Of course, there are tens of thousands of light years, or even hundreds of millions of light years.

1012
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,060
That's just running away, not man would have already run away

1013
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:58,060
Man-made numbers that can run may be 1/1000th of light

1014
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,060
that means

1015
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
There are many galaxies, but space is still very lonely

1016
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
You're going from one solar system to the next

1017
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And it might be a long, long time

1018
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So, here I will make a picture

1019
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
This is Eston, when he joined NASA very young

1020
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
This is him two years ago, our thermoelectric society

1021
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
In Pasadena, at the Celtic

1022
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Eston came to tell us the story of Voyager

1023
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
what does that mean? i want to tell him that means

1024
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
be his baby, his baby

1025
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
when done from here

1026
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
He is also in his seventies, seventies or eighties

1027
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
He's as ready as a spaceship

1028
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
retired

1029
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,020
It does sound a bit sentimental.

1030
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:07,020
But it's also pretty

1031
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,020
how to say

1032
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,020
A sense of accomplishment

1033
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:16,020
your mission has been

1034
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,020
the way to go

1035
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,020
The planets that should be explored have already been explored

1036
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:24,020
from here to here

1037
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:27,020
so it's an interesting story

1038
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,020
Of course what we are going to tell today is not his story.

1039
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,040
what we're going to talk about is this

1040
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,040
use him to generate electricity

1041
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,040
For example, this is another new one

1042
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,040
Mars

1043
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,040
You can use solar panels on Mars

1044
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,040
no no no

1045
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,040
The power of solar panels is still limited

1046
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,040
So it's this Mars rover

1047
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,040
Now it's about going to explore Mars.

1048
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,040
then you can smooth this

1049
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,040
after landing

1050
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,040
your cars

1051
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:59,060
You need pretty high power for this

1052
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,060
still want

1053
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,420
Use this RTG, this radioactive thermoelectric, to generate electricity

1054
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,420
So everyone can go from here

1055
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:14,820
You can feel that this thermal power has indeed made a very important contribution

1056
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,820
especially in space

1057
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,780
Then let's look at this thermoelectric conversion and many mathematical things

1058
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,280
let's not talk too much

1059
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,480
But this thing has a Figure Marriage

1060
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,480
What do we call optimization factor

1061
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,360
Basically it has an upstairs and a downstairs

1062
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,360
good

1063
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,360
It has an upstairs and a downstairs and multiplied by the temperature

1064
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,860
The bigger you go upstairs, the better

1065
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,860
The lower the downstairs, the better

1066
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,560
Upstairs is the thermoelectric coefficient we just talked about

1067
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,560
C-back coefficient

1068
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:53,060
Then there's an electrical conductivity here

1069
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,640
You said that the higher the conductivity, the greater the C-back coefficient

1070
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,640
that's better

1071
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,640
Downstairs is the heat transfer coefficient

1072
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,760
That leads to the smaller the better

1073
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,760
then if you can put this to play with it

1074
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,240
You can get better with this thermoelectric material

1075
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,760
but it's interesting

1076
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,280
In the past if you came to see

1077
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,760
This past human development

1078
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,960
Seven years from the 1940s to 1960

1079
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,760
Wow this is a little bit of progress

1080
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,920
In fact

1081
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,920
From 670 to 2000

1082
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,120
this

1083
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:33,280
This optimization factor is always below 1

1084
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,720
what's even

1085
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,680
some people doubt that

1086
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,480
ah this

1087
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,480
Is this optimization factor

1088
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,040
This maximum value

1089
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,120
must be small 1

1090
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,120
It means there is no hope

1091
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,200
I thought everyone would

1092
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,000
if

1093
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,760
I mentioned it here

1094
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,040
What if you want this optimization factor?

1095
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,360
If you want a sophomore

1096
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,600
It has the scrap meat we just talked about

1097
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,240
waste meat recycling

1098
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,440
what else

1099
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,960
our

1100
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,400
What is the name of this one in Yangmingshan?

1101
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
geothermal

1102
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
With this thing, a lot of energy can be recovered

1103
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
but you have to be good enough

1104
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,500
Or

1105
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:19,000
The air conditioner in your home or the one we are using now

1106
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
The most important thing for an air conditioner is a compressor

1107
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
that compressor

1108
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Although the efficiency is very good, it is very efficient

1109
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Then if you want to compete with the compressor

1110
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Your optimization factor should be greater than 4

1111
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
So let's see how much everyone has done so far.

1112
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
As just mentioned, most of them are below 1

1113
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
By the year 2000 or so

1114
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
got up from the start

1115
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Everyone gave up

1116
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
What is this year 2000?

1117
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
2000

1118
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Clinton announced that

1119
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
this

1120
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,400
National Science, the nanoscience initiative

1121
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:13,400
It's Congress passing a lot of money for the scientific community to do nanoscience.

1122
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:18,600
After the nano science is down, the part of the material, the nano material

1123
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:27,600
There are many, many improvements that make this a considerable improvement

1124
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:33,000
However, although there has been an improvement, it is probably still below two

1125
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,500
Especially, the real industrial application is only in this generation

1126
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:46,000
If you want to exceed two, now at most you will occasionally report in the laboratory

1127
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,400
So, there is still a long way to go for this development

1128
00:57:52,400 --> 00:58:00,000
Let’s look at it again, that is to say, most of this was done in the past, because

1129
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,840
So this heat conduction is getting lower and lower

1130
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:08,840
Instead, the part of the above molecule that needs to be elevated

1131
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,840
not much improvement

1132
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,840
That light reduces the heat conduction

1133
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,840
it's not enough

1134
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,840
how do you get in

1135
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,840
can change the material

1136
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,840
its electronic structure

1137
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,840
Etc., etc

1138
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,840
there's a lot to do

1139
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,840
let's not talk too much today

1140
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,840
went deep

1141
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,840
but let everyone feel

1142
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,840
For example, we just talked about your house

1143
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,840
Is this complex

1144
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,840
Still a regular house

1145
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,840
then it has different materials

1146
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,840
Here is 1.0

1147
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,840
1.0 is here

1148
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,840
most of the material

1149
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,840
In fact, it is all lower than 1

1150
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,840
there are a few

1151
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,840
can be higher than 1

1152
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,840
then here

1153
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,840
At the same time, I want to tell everyone

1154
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,840
these materials

1155
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,600
You said the Bismuth Terrarium we just talked about is good

1156
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:08,700
It can have a good oil coefficient at very low temperature

1157
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,800
But it's only good at certain temperatures

1158
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:17,100
The Silicon Jomainium that was just mentioned is going to space.

1159
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,400
it's not very high

1160
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,800
But it can go to very high temperature

1161
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,300
and then all behaved well

1162
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:28,400
Then your radioactive element can provide very high temperature

1163
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,000
so just right for it

1164
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,900
Every material it is not omnipotent

1165
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,800
It is only in a certain temperature range

1166
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,900
is the temperature at which it behaves well

1167
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:45,200
So it depends on what you want to use

1168
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,600
if you want to cool down

1169
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,900
then climb down

1170
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:49,900
come down

1171
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,600
If you want to generate electricity, go up

1172
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:56,200
If you want to use the waste heat of the car

1173
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,200
your exhaust pipe comes out

1174
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,900
about 800

1175
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,160
400 to 800 degrees, this one, this one

1176
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:10,000
Therefore, there may be a lot of research and development needed

1177
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,600
we'll see this later

1178
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,800
This thing, these parameters

1179
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,900
it is, it's not that simple, it's interactive

1180
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:26,900
For example, this is α, this is the thermoelectric parameter, and this is

1181
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:29,400
When you change something, it comes down

1182
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:33,200
But, among them, the conductivity number, the heavier it goes up

1183
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:38,500
Then you are like a see-saw, this side is higher and this side is lower

1184
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:43,500
Come down and go, or there is a saying in Minnan dialect

1185
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,300
It's better to describe it as Yagu Zhaobi

1186
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:49,800
You, when you came to this side, this side ran away again

1187
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:54,300
So, we are playing with this material, thermoelectric material

1188
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:57,900
The factory manager doesn't make materials as usual

1189
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,900
i want to see models, i don't just

1190
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,460
Just make it bigger

1191
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,020
No, your side is big

1192
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:04,300
Here is a small set

1193
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,820
so it's not easy

1194
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:08,620
OK

1195
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,700
that now there are many

1196
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,420
various materials

1197
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,820
I think I'm not going into details

1198
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:17,500
It has a resistant rice structure

1199
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,660
some put some material

1200
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:21,060
will keep it in

1201
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,860
This we call Rethylene

1202
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,700
let it over there

1203
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,260
this student

1204
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,360
when it's hot

1205
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,720
it will be over there

1206
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,880
vibrating inside

1207
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,760
Then let the heat go down easily

1208
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,720
There are even some materials that say

1209
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,080
it looks solid though

1210
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,240
But in fact it's like a liquid inside

1211
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,360
The heat will be more difficult to pass

1212
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,880
blah blah blah

1213
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,680
That is the same as, for example, Nami structural materials

1214
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,680
how are you like this

1215
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,360
Different we call Grain

1216
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,080
big or small

1217
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,080
or there is this

1218
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,780
with raisins, or with this sandwich biscuit in it

1219
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:05,940
Various materials now

1220
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:08,020
it's all there now

1221
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,180
lots to do

1222
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:12,940
Just now this was a trial intention

1223
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:14,880
this is

1224
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,640
What can be seen in the experimental materials

1225
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,820
good

1226
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,020
What about us

1227
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,520
what about the laboratory

1228
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,520
just mentioned

1229
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,520
This Silicon Jominium

1230
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,280
It has been proven, put it in the tire cavity and use it again

1231
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,200
Eh

1232
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,840
We say carbon finer

1233
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,500
right

1234
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,120
carbon fine

1235
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,800
wash

1236
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,000
ah

1237
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,720
wash

1238
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,320
then pull

1239
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,000
that row

1240
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,840
But Silicon Jominium can

1241
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,840
Then Silicon Tin can do it

1242
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,600
wash

1243
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,680
wash heel

1244
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,040
wash

1245
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,000
wash and wash

1246
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,800
These two are in the same row

1247
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,520
The electronic structure is almost

1248
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,720
only

1249
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,720
this ratio

1250
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,680
This washing is heavier than folding

1251
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,680
The heavier the thermoelectric material, the better.

1252
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,520
the heavier the words

1253
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,680
Its heat transfer will be slower

1254
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,920
so what

1255
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,360
we just wanna say wow

1256
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,360
then this will be better than this

1257
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,200
let's try

1258
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,200
Those who work on materials will know

1259
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,320
These two things never mix

1260
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,320
you put them in one by one

1261
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,320
as soon as the temperature drops

1262
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,320
separate soon

1263
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,320
impossible to be an alloy

1264
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,320
Then we said

1265
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,320
Impossible to alloy it doesn't matter

1266
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,320
then i'll let you make this

1267
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,320
We are called non-golden statues

1268
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,320
Amorphous

1269
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,320
what about Amorphous

1270
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,320
then we start researching

1271
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,320
Recently there seems to be a sign

1272
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,320
I can't explain it to you here.

1273
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,320
one direction like this

1274
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,320
we are actually doing now

1275
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,320
even say

1276
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,320
if these two

1277
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,320
won't mix

1278
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,400
This prisoner, I'll leave as soon as I see you

1279
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,600
Then can I use three, a love triangle

1280
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:12,600
It's a big deal between two people, let's put the third one in

1281
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,600
Magnetium Silicon Tin

1282
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:22,600
It is possible, in fact this material has been used a lot in thermoelectric materials

1283
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,600
studied a lot

1284
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,100
Of course it's very important

1285
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,400
For example, although the material is very good

1286
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,900
But you can tell when you see the material

1287
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,900
If you don't touch this Germanium, you better not touch it

1288
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,900
because it's expensive

1289
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:43,900
It is probably more than a hundred times that of Silicon

1290
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:48,900
So you have a lot of money just to buy materials

1291
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,900
But you said Silicon and Tin, laundry and drama

1292
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,400
Both of these are many on the surface

1293
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,400
So it's cheap in comparison

1294
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,400
But the two don't touch together

1295
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
what to do

1296
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:02,000

1297
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Magnetism Silicon Tin

1298
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
This is also cheap

1299
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
The second and third are cheaper

1300
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
then this looks good

1301
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
So Japan in this regard

1302
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
great effort

1303
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
so let everyone

1304
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Feel it, so what materials can you play with

1305
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
for example

1306
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Germanium Terulium

1307
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
this is also a

1308
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
our normal one

1309
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Used in your home

1310
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
DVDs, CDs

1311
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Once the laser is fired, it will

1312
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
in disguise

1313
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
So use this to remember

1314
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
memory for CD

1315
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
already used a lot

1316
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
We found that it

1317
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Mainly like this battery

1318
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
We also recently got some

1319
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
effect, looks

1320
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
It's really good, although it's inside

1321
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
This Germanium is quite expensive

1322
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Terulium is not cheap either

1323
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
but

1324
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
from research

1325
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
OK

1326
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
ok good

1327
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,320
this is a

1328
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,320
uh just arrived

1329
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,820
Professor Zhiwei Zhang from Ningtai Center

1330
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:10,820
he brought it up

1331
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,820
He said you just put two, two episodes

1332
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:15,820
one can one hot one cold

1333
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:17,820
It's over

1334
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:19,820
uh this is not enough

1335
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:21,820
He uses three-stage

1336
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:23,820
Thermoelectric materials are

1337
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,820
uh sorry

1338
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,820
I

1339
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:29,820
good

1340
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:31,820
again

1341
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:53,820
So what about Professor Zhang Zhiwei?

1342
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:55,820
he just

1343
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,820
does not pose a method

1344
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:59,820
Say you have three temperatures

1345
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:01,820
one

1346
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,260
two, three

1347
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,200
Then this material is very special

1348
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,480
He thinks that if this material is a material called

1349
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,960
When electricity or heat is transmitted, it is called

1350
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,540
is one is one

1351
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:15,760
Belistic

1352
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,760
that is

1353
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,960
Not the usual diffuser

1354
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,440
but a bullet-like transmission

1355
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:25,260
In this way you can get

1356
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:26,760
higher efficiency

1357
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:30,260
Then it is still working hard

1358
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:31,760
In addition

1359
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,760
The laboratory of Academician Wu Maokun

1360
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,760
It uses one called Aerogel

1361
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,760
Aerogel is a

1362
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,760
Oxide-based materials

1363
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,760
But it is a very

1364
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,760
Sponge-like oxidation system

1365
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:51,760
Oxidizing system because it can withstand very high heat

1366
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,760
so what

1367
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,760
it won't dissolve

1368
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,760
For example, this is a torch and a flame

1369
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,760
It burns in this Aerogel

1370
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,400
The L of the crab is on the bottom, and a flower is placed on it, it will not be affected

1371
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,720
So it conducts heat very, very low

1372
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:18,440
So Academician Wu combined this material with existing thermoelectric materials

1373
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:25,760
Then it was found that the parameters of thermoelectricity can be effectively improved

1374
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:31,200
Wait, I can't introduce everything

1375
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:35,760
This is Professor Chen Lidong in Shanghai

1376
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:43,440
One of the things he did was to say that it develops thermoelectricity. If you were a freshman in thermoelectricity before

1377
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:47,520
At the beginning you can only use it in space, with a very special

1378
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:51,120
Slowly heat and electricity, if it reaches about 2000

1379
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:59,440
It has a few more, including this familiar refrigerator and more

1380
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,500
energy available

1381
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,000
that's it

1382
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
What about after 2020?

1383
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
this

1384
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
its this gt

1385
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
freshman

1386
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,500
even up to 1.5

1387
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,500
Slowly it can be used in the car

1388
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,500
etc.

1389
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,500
It is more and more widely used

1390
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,000
that's like i said

1391
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,500
if you really want to be useful

1392
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,000
Still have to go to 2.0

1393
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,500
or 4.0

1394
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,500
is it possible to get there

1395
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,000
Now everyone is still working hard

1396
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,500
I'll make one with him

1397
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,500
current difficulties

1398
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:35,500
What about the difficulty?

1399
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,500
The first is that it is not efficient enough

1400
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,000
usually

1401
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,500
about 10%

1402
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,500
10% is

1403
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,500
already very high

1404
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,000
but

1405
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
if you come to tell

1406
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,500
If you want to generate electricity

1407
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,500
e.g. solar

1408
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,500
or wind energy

1409
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,500
What about solar energy?

1410
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,000
has long been proven

1411
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,160
He said he is now the cheapest of all energy sources

1412
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,760
That

1413
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,160
We are all looking for alternative energy now

1414
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,760
I can cut it right here

1415
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:17,600
that is

1416
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,920
Alternative Energy of the Future

1417
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,600
This solar is mainstream

1418
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,960
The second is wind power

1419
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,120
What about wind power?

1420
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:29,640
recently

1421
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:30,540
Well

1422
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,320
also from

1423
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:35,640
The original price has been reduced to

1424
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:36,040
ha

1425
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:37,240
and

1426
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:40,280
This thermal power generation

1427
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:42,720
Similar to traditional thermal power generation

1428
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:44,640
That

1429
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:48,720
This thing is of course similar to the energy transformation we are doing in Taiwan.

1430
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,180
Then our government is also developing these two areas

1431
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:51,540
ha

1432
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,380
Although that said

1433
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,120
They are all

1434
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,740
Very Potential Very Cheap

1435
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,280
ha

1436
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:00,080
but

1437
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,560
The first one you have to invest in earlier

1438
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,600
the second

1439
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,660
they don't exist forever

1440
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:10,500
And what if there is no sun in this cover transit today?

1441
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,520
you will be gone

1442
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:14,080
Or there is no wind today

1443
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,380
your wind stops

1444
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,460
Then you sometimes do and sometimes don't

1445
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:24,320
It involves the storage of electricity as an energy source

1446
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:26,360
that is becoming very very important

1447
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:28,680
There may be many colleagues here

1448
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:29,700
all in

1449
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,260
related to this research

1450
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:34,060
That

1451
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:36,360
but anyway

1452
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:37,380
anyway

1453
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,680
if this

1454
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:40,700
like germany

1455
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:42,500
they from that

1456
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,300
Japanese style

1457
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:45,580
that tsunami

1458
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,620
three one

1459
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:48,640
after

1460
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,440
they suddenly

1461
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,480
awakened over night said

1462
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:55,820
Let's not go nuclear in the future

1463
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:57,860
Nuclear power will be abolished in a few years

1464
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:59,920
they actively go

1465
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,320
That one is these two, wind energy and solar energy

1466
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:07,160
Well they confirmed today

1467
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:11,520
Prove that this is a feasible solution

1468
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,880
He has confirmed that step by step

1469
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,920
Of course it is impossible to say within a year or two

1470
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:24,060
He can phase out this future nuclear power step by step

1471
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:27,400
Even this petrochemical raw material in the future

1472
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:33,540
Coal or oil or natural gas

1473
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:37,900
The whole step by step use this

1474
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:40,960
We call sustainable green energy

1475
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,180
can be used in the future

1476
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:52,740
green energy to replace

1477
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:54,800
That

1478
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,100
but

1479
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,400
he needs a while

1480
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,940
What is your government's plan?

1481
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:05,060
how determined are you

1482
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,340
but

1483
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:10,220
Such alternative energy

1484
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:13,860
Is it possible to use thermoelectricity?

1485
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,580
Thermoelectricity is far worse than it

1486
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:16,980
General Solar

1487
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:18,980
you are in the lab now

1488
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:21,420
Simply more than 20%

1489
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:24,900
In the market you can buy 15%

1490
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,100
15% complete

1491
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,540
Then you have to say 5% of our thermal power

1492
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:30,540
right it's hard how you compete

1493
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:32,140
so i'm going to talk to him later

1494
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:34,140
If you want to develop thermoelectricity

1495
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:37,140
you want to use it for a very special purpose

1496
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:39,740
Our name is Niche Application

1497
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:41,940
What about this special purpose?

1498
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:43,940
The most special thing is the spaceship

1499
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:45,440
then it really needs it

1500
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,440
Only it can take on this responsibility

1501
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,440
Are there any others?

1502
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,740
is there any other

1503
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:53,240
Our name is Niche Application

1504
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,640
talk later

1505
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,840
In addition

1506
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,340
One is its high material cost

1507
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:00,340
you say i put it...

1508
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,760
it mounts on the car

1509
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:07,600
Then I can increase the mileage by 10%

1510
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,200
Very good, 10% is also 10%

1511
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,700
if i had this when i bought it

1512
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,000
Then I save 10%

1513
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,400
but

1514
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,700
Current thermoelectric materials are too expensive

1515
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:21,500
so what

1516
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,400
Your previous investment was too high

1517
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,300
that can only be tested again

1518
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:30,600
You can't really use this for people's livelihood

1519
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,700
So how to develop this material

1520
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,200
Don't use that expensive material

1521
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,000
use cheap materials

1522
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,800
is also an important point

1523
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,000
good

1524
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,300
but

1525
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,100
when we talk about energy

1526
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,900
especially when it comes to alternative energy

1527
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:48,900
many people will make some mistakes

1528
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,800
idea or imagination

1529
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,100
for example

1530
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,200
Use water as energy

1531
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,800
what day is it

1532
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,500
That day the dean

1533
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,100
When the dean of the tune gave a speech, there was a speech that said

1534
01:14:59,100 --> 01:14:59,200
Why

1535
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,440
Direct water can be used as energy

1536
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,740
why do we still have to buy gasoline

1537
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:07,000
Why do we still want to develop nuclear energy

1538
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,800
Why develop thermal power

1539
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,760
right

1540
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,800
Can water be used as energy?

1541
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,280
can anyone answer

1542
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,320
water as energy

1543
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,880
Then we can use carbon dioxide as energy

1544
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,160
carbon dioxide more

1545
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,120
our this

1546
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,960
it will produce this global warming

1547
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:29,720
We use it as energy

1548
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,800
water as energy

1549
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,120
Water can be used as energy

1550
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,920
you put this water

1551
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,600
break it down into

1552
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,960
hydrogen and oxygen

1553
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,680
What about the hydrogen?

1554
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,560
You can use fuel cells and so on

1555
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,240
use it

1556
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:47,440
That

1557
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:50,920
People say it is the cleanest energy

1558
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,600
because when you use

1559
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,600
Hydrogen turns into water again

1560
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:55,680
So no pollution at all

1561
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:56,880
correct

1562
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:57,960
but

1563
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,080
you have to turn water into

1564
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Cyan and oxygen

1565
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
then you have many ways

1566
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
The most common method is to use electrolysis

1567
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
our middle school

1568
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Even elementary school nature lessons

1569
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I've done it for everyone to see

1570
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
How did that call come from?

1571
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Most of the electricity still comes from

1572
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
power plant out

1573
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
so

1574
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
not impossible

1575
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
we say

1576
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
I said before that you are generating electricity

1577
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
What do you use electricity to electrolyze water for?

1578
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
cleanest and best

1579
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Why are you going to electrolyze water?

1580
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Does anyone know

1581
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
disable

1582
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
that is

1583
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
your nuclear power plant

1584
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
or your many power plants

1585
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
you can't switch

1586
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
then you when you

1587
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
At night you still have power left

1588
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
what to do

1589
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
deplete its electrolyzed water

1590
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
when you run out of power

1591
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
when the sun doesn't have the sun

1592
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
You generate electricity like this

1593
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
that so

1594
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,400
It is said that water can be used as energy

1595
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,800
This is only one tenth right

1596
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,600
It didn't talk about how the water turns into hydrogen, right?

1597
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,600
that's the real difficulty

1598
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,400
like many labs including mine

1599
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,400
Still researching how to electrolyze water

1600
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:21,600
It is to make the efficiency of electrolysis of water higher

1601
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,200
take its material

1602
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,000
Because it used to be made of platinum or something.

1603
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
reduce it

1604
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,200
how much time do we have

1605
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,200
We were just 8.5

1606
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,200
8.5

1607
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,200
that other thing

1608
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:38,400
It would be good to say that air is the motive force of the car.

1609
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,200
Why do you have this air everywhere

1610
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,200
You see people have taken some countries

1611
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,200
has proven it this bus

1612
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,200
run on air

1613
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:50,400
And it sounds a lot like the real thing

1614
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,400
it also proves to you

1615
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,400
This blows air in

1616
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,400
It can run dozens of kilometers in one run

1617
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,800
what it didn't say

1618
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,620
You compress this air into

1619
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:04,000
Look at the top ten atmospheric pressure

1620
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,160
then use that to run

1621
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,200
compression process

1622
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,200
it just needs electricity

1623
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,700
use motor or oil

1624
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,200
so what

1625
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,800
not so easy

1626
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,160
Are electric cars the cleanest form of energy?

1627
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,400
Methods

1628
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,400
electric cars of course

1629
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,400
You didn't emit any smoke when you went out

1630
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,800
no other waste

1631
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:26,460
right

1632
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,920
But how does it get electricity

1633
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,120
electricity you if not from solar

1634
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,420
you still have to get from the power plant

1635
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:35,520
that power plant has its benefits

1636
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,420
Its power plant is that it is focused on you

1637
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:40,920
If you discharge these

1638
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,320
Carbon dioxide and these waste

1639
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,020
you can immediately

1640
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,220
If you filter it before discharging it

1641
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:50,620
then you can reduce the level of air pollution

1642
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:51,920
than say

1643
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:52,920
normal car

1644
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,720
That day the Sixth Dean spoke

1645
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,020
cars run around

1646
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:58,720
Once it's out, you can't get it back.

1647
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,020
this has it

1648
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
But it's not an absolute solution

1649
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Well, another one I want to give an example to tell you

1650
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Not all energy sources are equally efficient

1651
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:22,000
For example, Hawaii, raise your hand if you haven't been to Hawaii

1652
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:28,000
There are many parties in Hawaii

1653
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
There is a party in Hawaii called Big Island

1654
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:38,000
The biggest Big Island is Hawaiian coffee

1655
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
It is produced in a place called Kona

1656
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Hawaii has many volcanoes

1657
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Monglowa is a

1658
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Then Killer Whale next to it is still spraying every day

1659
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
there are so many

1660
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:06,800
Natural resources, and one of the more interesting natural resources among them

1661
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,400
He is naturally the same as our Huadong and Rift Valley.

1662
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:15,400
That is, the seaside drop is very, very large

1663
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:21,600
You may have descended to a depth of hundreds of meters after going out for tens of meters

1664
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,800
What's so good about this?

1665
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:29,000
This genius scientist came up with the idea of ​​saying

1666
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
He went for a measurement and found that

1667
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:37,200
This one drops 1,000 feet, about 300 meters

1668
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:43,400
The water temperature is more than 20 degrees different from the water at sea level

1669
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:49,600
You have a temperature difference from the mechanics above

1670
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,800
You can generate power with just a temperature difference

1671
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:58,200
Okay, then he's coming, and he's trying to get that one thousand feet

1672
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,400
The water temperature at a depth of 300 meters

1673
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
pump up the water

1674
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
like here

1675
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
wet liquid soil

1676
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
pump up deep water

1677
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Then the water temperature difference from sea level is 20 degrees

1678
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Then it needs this temperature difference to drive a Turban generator

1679
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,000
It's like 20 degrees water without boiling

1680
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
how enough

1681
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
it doesn't matter

1682
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
General power plants boil water

1683
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,000
then go push that warrant

1684
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
it if use an alcohol

1685
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
or use something

1686
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
It has a lower boiling point

1687
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
it can do the same thing

1688
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
20 degrees temperature difference can be done

1689
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
that's the problem

1690
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
you pump up the water

1691
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
you need electricity

1692
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
you need energy

1693
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Then you have to generate electricity

1694
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
After all, you generate more electricity

1695
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Or do you use more electricity to pump water?

1696
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
right

1697
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
good

1698
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
good question

1699
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,400
Congress of the United States

1700
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,100
divided into two

1701
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,900
Allocated dozens of million

1702
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:08,000
Then what

1703
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,200
do research for them

1704
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,300
prove

1705
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,300
he can generate electricity

1706
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:14,200
is the electricity ratio

1707
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,600
use more electricity

1708
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,700
wow this

1709
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,000
scientifically

1710
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,200
big success

1711
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,000
success

1712
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:21,600
OK

1713
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:22,900
but i want to ask

1714
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:24,400
How much do you charge once

1715
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:26,700
Probably

1716
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,400
10 times more than ours

1717
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:29,900
wow that

1718
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,100
high cost

1719
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:33,900
what to do

1720
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:34,500
so

1721
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,800
when we talk

1722
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,600
wow what energy what energy

1723
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:38,500
ah this

1724
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,600
Where is the geothermal heat?

1725
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:40,800
where is the hot spring

1726
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,300
first we have to ask

1727
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:44,500
your

1728
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,600
How much is the electricity you send

1729
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,200
OK

1730
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,600
The second one, for example, when we talk about biomass energy

1731
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,700
That sounds good

1732
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:52,400
right

1733
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,900
Biomass is very good in the US and in Canada

1734
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,700
it has so many forests

1735
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:57,800
It has some long

1736
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,700
But there are not many forests in Taiwan

1737
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,600
You get all those digital pages of Taiwan's forest

1738
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,920
Not enough for Taiwan's current needs

1739
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:11,280
then this is an example

1740
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,840
scientifically successful

1741
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:14,600
but

1742
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,640
economically worthless

1743
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,200
then i used to

1744
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,520
At that time with Professor Chen Jiajun

1745
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,320
There was a meeting at Air Force in the United States

1746
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:26,360
just flow over to see

1747
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,920
Just go and see for yourself

1748
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,960
It's called OTEC

1749
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,800
Ocean Thermoelectric Conversion

1750
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,920
After the result, it was a very surprise

1751
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,200
First

1752
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,760
Of course they do.

1753
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:44,800
power generation

1754
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,840
Electricity is expensive

1755
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:48,120
What to do then he just needs to find

1756
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,680
Find a way to subsidize it, right?

1757
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:51,960
how to subsidize

1758
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:52,720
very funny

1759
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,800
After the electricity is generated, the water, yes

1760
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:57,600
deep water called

1761
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,920
hawaii sound

1762
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
ocean water

1763
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
ok

1764
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Then he battled

1765
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Then fly to Tokyo

1766
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Ah, it's so scary

1767
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
made a lot of money

1768
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
alright

1769
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
It's been a few years

1770
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
because of that water

1771
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
salty water man

1772
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
People can't drink

1773
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
So he's going to downplay him, right?

1774
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Dilution is our general RO

1775
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
reverse osmosis

1776
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
good

1777
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Sell ​​after reverse osmosis

1778
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
after a few years

1779
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
next to it

1780
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
that pile of salt

1781
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
a bunch of mountains

1782
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Headache?

1783
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
right? what should he do?

1784
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
then he said

1785
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
then thought of saying

1786
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
pack the salt

1787
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Air freight to Japan for sale

1788
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Raw water

1789
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
raw sea

1790
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
what kind of salt is this

1791
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
sold out

1792
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
that's not all

1793
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
when we went to see

1794
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
They also did an experiment

1795
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Said the water pumped from here

1796
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
to raise those seafood

1797
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
than this

1798
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Seafood grown from water on the sea

1799
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Raised too much

1800
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
good

1801
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,560
In the end it doesn't matter at all

1802
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,860
really earning extra money

1803
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:07,300
That

1804
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:10,000
You say it's a bit sarcastic

1805
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,020
but also

1806
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:14,600
And at least he proved a lot of things, okay?

1807
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,860
good

1808
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:19,200
we have a chance

1809
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,260
For example, this car

1810
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:24,060
Then you say you come out of the engine

1811
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:26,620
then to this

1812
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:28,660
Exhaust pipe goes to this

1813
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:30,960
we need noodle drinkers or something

1814
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:35,820
The temperature here ranges from 700 to 800 to 600 to 500 to 400

1815
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:38,660
So what you need to say here is that you want to do thermoelectricity

1816
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:40,700
The materials you want are different

1817
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:41,960
mean to say

1818
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,540
We still have a lot of rice bowls to eat

1819
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:47,100
can study a lot

1820
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,880
again now there is

1821
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,160
you can buy it in the market

1822
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:50,940
this is

1823
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:55,540
Get $100 off the internet and you can buy a refrigerator

1824
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:56,560
what about this refrigerator

1825
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:57,840
15L

1826
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,840
is thermoelectric

1827
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,560
you may not feel

1828
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,240
What is thermal power

1829
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,520
First

1830
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,280
If you want to put a small refrigerator in your car

1831
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:12,000
put in your suitcase too

1832
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,800
too big for you

1833
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:17,200
Normal compressor refrigerators are pretty big.

1834
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,680
Because the compressor itself is not small

1835
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:20,840
Then if you use thermoelectric

1836
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:21,640
that small is good

1837
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:28,120
You might just need a few L's for your energy

1838
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,520
except this

1839
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,560
I don't know if anyone has the same experience as me

1840
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,120
you go to a meeting like this

1841
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:36,000
then came to a place

1842
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,400
time difference

1843
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:40,520
can't sleep very troublesome

1844
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,560
I can finally fall asleep

1845
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,960
in that room

1846
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:47,000
Every now hotel has a refrigerator inside

1847
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,920
that refrigerator is noisy

1848
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,080
finally got up

1849
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,640
Can't turn off that refrigerator

1850
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:56,040
Then unplug it long ago

1851
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:58,240
Why is the refrigerator so noisy

1852
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,040
But if you use this today

1853
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
no sound at all

1854
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Once we went abroad in

1855
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
somewhere

1856
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
he declared that he was

1857
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
this thermoelectric refrigerator

1858
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
really no sound at all

1859
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
so what

1860
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
he has his special purpose

1861
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
or say you make a

1862
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
local cooling

1863
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
cooling is effective

1864
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
For example, you are

1865
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
when driving in a seat

1866
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
there are some parts

1867
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
cooling is nice

1868
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
A

1869
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
currently in use

1870
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
For example, we used to

1871
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
There are many detectors in the laboratory

1872
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
CCD, infrared

1873
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
detector

1874
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
You have to bring the temperature down

1875
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Your noise will be reduced

1876
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
The cooling of this thermoelectric

1877
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
very effective

1878
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
because it doesn't vibrate

1879
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
So it's less noisy

1880
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
In addition

1881
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
have many computers

1882
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
or your CPU

1883
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Your mobile phone is getting better and better

1884
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
powerful is getting denser and denser

1885
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
That powerful means that it unit time

1886
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
It does more and more calculations

1887
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Then the density is more crowded

1888
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
The heat dissipated per unit time

1889
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Higher and higher

1890
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
In fact, many CPU applications

1891
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
not limited to itself

1892
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
It's limiting its heat and there's no way to get it out

1893
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Can't get away

1894
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Then if you do a local thermoelectric cooling

1895
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
absolutely necessary

1896
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
what about this need

1897
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
We can look at it from another use

1898
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
This is what we call a hydrodynamic missile

1899
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Tom Hawk

1900
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
That Tom Hawk missile

1901
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
As soon as the missile flies out

1902
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
OK you take the map

1903
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
put it in its head

1904
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
when it's flying

1905
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
it will fly along your map

1906
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
how does it know

1907
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Where is it? It relies on the same GPS that everyone uses in cars.

1908
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:09,000
It's just that it needs to be very precise. Besides whether the left and right will touch the mountain

1909
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:15,000
It also needs to know the height. Usually our cars don’t count the height.

1910
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
It tells you when to turn right and how to turn left

1911
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Then when you use it, you know yourself. If you have a mobile phone, you are using GPS.

1912
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Your battery dies in a very short time unless you're plugged in all the time

1913
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Why because it's been calculating it's been following the signal received from the satellite

1914
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Instead it says where is my point now

1915
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:40,000
The computing power is very high, so here comes

1916
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:46,000
If you want to guide a missile today, your power is so high

1917
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:51,000
That computer burned up quickly so every computer

1918
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Just now everyone saw that MARLO is the most profitable, and all the money it makes is this money

1919
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
are used on missiles

1920
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
OK, so you know this we call Niche application

1921
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:09,000
is the special purpose, the localized cooling of the cooling

1922
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:18,000
In addition, I want to tell you about the many thermoelectric devices developed in South Korea called Kawashiro-style flexible

1923
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Will it work, I don't know

1924
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Then when I read it, I thought I kept

1925
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Because you know your body temperature is 36 degrees

1926
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Then your outside is 30 degrees or 25 degrees

1927
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,000
This delta T is actually very small, even if it is 10 degrees

1928
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Then you usually make this material

1929
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:49,000
From your contact, the contact itself has some temperature loss

1930
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Finally, if you come to a delta T temperature difference of 5 degrees

1931
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,000
In fact, the electricity it can generate will generate electricity, but it will generate very little electricity.

1932
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
whether that will work i don't know

1933
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,500
South Korea is very very positive

1934
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,680
He said I might make a

1935
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:06,280
very small

1936
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:08,740
Like some Pace Makers or something

1937
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:12,540
It would be nice to be able to make a small generator

1938
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:15,780
another one i was thinking

1939
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:19,140
this is a dress

1940
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,800
is it possible

1941
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,240
if you can make it flexible

1942
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:26,360
Is it possible for

1943
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:27,480
it's cooler inside

1944
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:31,480
Then vent the heat out in the outer layer

1945
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:34,480
You don't need to turn on the air conditioner so much

1946
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:35,780
India often reaches 50 degrees

1947
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:36,980
but you wear a cool dress

1948
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:39,280
It's very comfortable inside

1949
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:44,680
You don't have air conditioners everywhere

1950
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:47,680
that thing

1951
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:51,980
It's not impossible

1952
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:54,980
You have to generate electricity from your body temperature

1953
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:56,180
i find it difficult

1954
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:57,480
but like i said

1955
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,980
You have to use electricity to be smart

1956
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,600
Reporter is okay, is doable

1957
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,600
Come again, I want to talk about this

1958
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:11,100
Do you know the football game of this world cup

1959
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:13,900
I didn't look at the chief today

1960
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:16,100
Everyone is watching, everyone sees that

1961
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:20,100
Take a few countries, and finally this Championship

1962
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:23,100
France's Creecia, against

1963
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:26,900
you know the france team

1964
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:31,000
Finally, special thanks to Taiwan

1965
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,000
what good things did we do in taiwan

1966
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,500
Our jersey sweatshirt

1967
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:41,300
Taiwan made sweatshirts for their players

1968
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:43,900
on the pitch than anything else

1969
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:46,100
It's easy to sweat

1970
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:49,800
He especially thanked Taiwan

1971
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,000
then i mean the same

1972
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,400
If you take the heat out

1973
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,900
isn't that better

1974
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:59,700
You can do it anytime, it's stuffy and hot outside

1975
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,040
you feel comfortable

1976
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,600
it is possible

1977
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:05,800
so finally i say

1978
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:09,680
Thermoelectric has made many great contributions in the past

1979
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:10,560
but

1980
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:14,720
In all aspects of efficiency, you are in the niche application

1981
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:16,040
before it can be used

1982
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:19,320
Then it can't compete with solar and wind power

1983
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,000
to compete for this generation

1984
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,560
How to improve the efficiency so that

1985
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,200
Even Niche application

1986
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,400
You also want to lower the price

1987
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,880
but i think that

1988
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:29,800
What about the future?

1989
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,120
local cooling

1990
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:34,480
will be where the greater opportunity lies

1991
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:35,480
good

1992
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:38,720
I'm here to report to you today

1993
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:39,440
Thanks

1994
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:43,760
good

1995
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,440
i think such a wonderful speech

1996
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:46,640
everyone should have

1997
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:48,320
quite a few questions

1998
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,480
Whether it is scientific application

1999
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:51,520
or history

2000
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:52,560
i want this

2001
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,320
Teacher Chen has many

2002
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,840
Information to share with you

2003
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,520
So if you have any questions, you can raise your hands

2004
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Please, can you use the front microphone

2005
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I'm sorry I'm a layman but please advise

2006
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Because it's on the market right now, it's about to happen

2007
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Referendum on Nuclear Oxygen Chlorine Thing

2008
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
what is your opinion

2009
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Thanks

2010
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
This question is quite political.

2011
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Let's not talk about politics, okay?

2012
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Let's not talk about politics, okay? Thank you.

2013
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
just say he meant to say

2014
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,000
In your green energy, green energy needs to be developed

2015
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
i don't think anyone will object

2016
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
The problem is green energy, as I said

2017
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
They can't be in a year or two

2018
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
even within ten years

2019
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Humans now include Germany

2020
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Including California has spent a lot of effort

2021
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
investing in green energy

2022
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
but his your making

2023
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
It may take ten years for you to grow up

2024
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,000
It was twenty years later that I arrived at a certain place

2025
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
this amount

2026
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
that's okay

2027
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,400
Then where the green energy is really developed

2028
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:06,700
I use nuclear power to get by

2029
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:08,800
Sounds good to pass the time

2030
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,200
Where is the problem?

2031
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,800
The director of the tune also mentioned it that day.

2032
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,200
first nuclear waste

2033
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,800
That nuclear waste is not a problem in many countries

2034
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,000
like india

2035
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,600
They are also actively developing their nuclear power

2036
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,600
France they have the technology to put

2037
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:29,500
This nuclear waste is re-enriched

2038
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,500
made smaller and easier to store

2039
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:34,800
but sorry

2040
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,100
We don't have that technology in Taiwan

2041
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:41,800
Is there any place in Taiwan where nuclear waste can be placed?

2042
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:43,600
I believe that I don't need to tell you

2043
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,100
Everyone has been arguing for a long time

2044
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:49,000
So if the nuclear waste has nowhere to go

2045
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:51,200
what to do then

2046
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:54,000
Everyone wants to say that it's fine to put it in someone else's house.

2047
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,600
So it's a controversy

2048
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,000
What do you say

2049
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
that nuclear waste

2050
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,800
That's not something that will happen today or in the next year.

2051
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,600
Then we will have been producing in the past few decades.

2052
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:08,800
Right, then can you continue to store in the existing place

2053
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:13,400
even said to store it in a nuclear power plant

2054
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:16,400
that's what we're already doing now

2055
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,600
Everyone should know

2056
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:22,400
Nuclear abolition just like I said Ptonium is one of them

2057
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,800
it is still active

2058
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:29,900
OK so you're not saying just throw it in a pile

2059
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:33,500
This radioactive element

2060
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:35,200
it has a

2061
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:38,800
it will keep releasing this

2062
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:42,900
These things in Alpha particle's New Chore

2063
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:47,500
But most importantly things like nuclear bombs

2064
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:50,400
It has one of the most important principles

2065
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:53,600
called a chain reaction

2066
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,600
Chain reaction is called Chain reaction

2067
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,700
it means me

2068
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
It is OK to put the color temperature and temperature here

2069
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
It's OK to put this here

2070
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,640
But it's not OK when you put the two together

2071
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:09,200
because it keeps pointing out

2072
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:10,800
it keeps pointing out

2073
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,320
when you put it close

2074
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:13,200
its middle finger hits it

2075
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,000
its middle finger hits it

2076
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
it just exploded

2077
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,200
So you can't put a lot of lung ingredients together

2078
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:24,400
The Japanese one is more special

2079
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,400
That is, it has a certain amount of cooling

2080
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,800
As a result, an earthquake suddenly interrupted the cooling water

2081
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,800
that's information

2082
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,800
good

2083
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,800
our lung material

2084
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,800
the first has nowhere to go

2085
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,800
the second

2086
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,800
where our nuclear power plant can be placed

2087
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,800
almost full

2088
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,800
OK

2089
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,800
So now as far as I know

2090
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,800
Taipower is even considering saying

2091
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,800
we are in winter this

2092
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,800
When energy demand is not so high

2093
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,800
we deload the nuclear power plant

2094
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,320
so not so much river waste

2095
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:06,480
Then turn it up a bit more when needed

2096
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:09,320
It's because there's no place for river waste

2097
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:15,480
Then you say that you can build a few more houses nearby to do it.

2098
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:19,320
then they have what's called dry storage

2099
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:21,000
Now we're talking about wet storage

2100
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,680
Put this river waste in some kind of water

2101
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:28,000
You said dry storage exists?

2102
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,800
We were going to open

2103
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:34,000
Is it approved by the Taipei County Government?

2104
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,320
The Taipei County Government will never issue licenses

2105
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,120
Then you have to do it when you have a motor

2106
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:43,120
You can't do it with the budget

2107
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:47,120
Guanghe waste is enough of a headache

2108
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:52,360
As for whether it is possible to happen like Che Nuobao

2109
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:54,280
like the tutoring question

2110
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:57,240
That's a question of risk

2111
01:38:57,240 --> 01:39:00,040
Last time we said there was a risk, that's okay.

2112
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,400
It's a risk for me to drive

2113
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,800
It's also risky for me to fly.

2114
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,700
It's also a risk for me to take the high-speed rail.

2115
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:07,200
risk you buy insurance

2116
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,400
is there anyone today

2117
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,100
Is there any men's insurance company that sells it?

2118
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:13,600
nuclear disaster insurance for you

2119
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:15,900
Is it sure to make money?

2120
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:17,200
Everyone is scared, right?

2121
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,700
The insurance company must make money

2122
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:21,900
but i tell you

2123
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:23,400
If he can sell nuclear disaster insurance today

2124
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,400
he absolutely lied to you

2125
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,900
Because in the event of a nuclear disaster

2126
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:27,900
he can't afford it

2127
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:29,800
right

2128
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,500
So many things are unresolved

2129
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:34,000
so

2130
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:36,800
that's all i can say

2131
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,700
that political issue

2132
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:40,700
This is very oriented

2133
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:41,000
Yes or no

2134
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:41,800
over there please

2135
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:43,500
should use that mic

2136
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:50,200
is a very

2137
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,400
It's a source of energy worth using.

2138
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:53,800
yes

2139
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:56,400
But I've heard people say that I don't know

2140
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:57,600
right or wrong

2141
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,200
He said he still wants yours

2142
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:00,000
board

2143
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Then he still has his time

2144
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
his deadline

2145
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
take him there

2146
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
thank you

2147
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
solar general

2148
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
because he is using

2149
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
For example C, silicon

2150
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,000
He has a lot of material on one surface

2151
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Elements

2152
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Then if after using

2153
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
direct reuse

2154
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,000
or just let it go back to

2155
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,000
There is actually not much pollution on the surface

2156
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,000
fine solar energy for people to combine

2157
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
all solar alike

2158
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
You said I made this solar energy

2159
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,000
The efficiency is very high and the cost will be paid back in a few years

2160
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
but someone said

2161
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
No, if you count

2162
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
you come out of the surface

2163
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
And then store it until the end this solar energy

2164
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
that cost

2165
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
the phone you speak

2166
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
It is also very likely to be ignored by you

2167
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,800
He said no, but when he sold me

2168
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:03,460
Those costs are factored in

2169
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:04,660
he said no

2170
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:06,800
because we are all

2171
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:08,000
especially in taiwan

2172
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,300
Our store is built to sell

2173
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:16,660
store or gasoline

2174
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:18,860
We don't have a detective now

2175
01:41:18,860 --> 01:41:21,760
is when you consider an energy source

2176
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:22,560
you can't talk

2177
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,800
what a job i do when i go with it

2178
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:25,460
you should consider saying

2179
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:25,920
when i use it to go

2180
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:27,760
I generate that pollution

2181
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,960
is there any cost

2182
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:30,460
right

2183
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:32,120
It's the same as He Leng

2184
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:34,760
wow some say it's the cheapest energy

2185
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:35,660
but then

2186
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:38,460
If you remove the liquid from the river power plant

2187
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:40,620
You waste the river from the river power plant

2188
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:43,560
Once counted, it becomes the most expensive

2189
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:48,020
so many things to consider

2190
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:50,560
The process of making this solar panel

2191
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:54,520
Its many unaccounted for costs

2192
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:55,220
also in it

2193
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:58,780
But I guess pollution is not an important

2194
01:41:58,780 --> 01:41:59,780
All right

2195
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
come here

2196
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
ask for advice

2197
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
our land of taiwan

2198
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
not big

2199
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
and then add that

2200
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
365 days a year

2201
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
number of days in the sun

2202
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
For us in Taiwan

2203
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
like solar panels

2204
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
seems not suitable

2205
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
we taiwan

2206
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Sun exposure is of course

2207
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
a very important

2208
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
For example, we are in Taipei

2209
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Follow in Kaohsiung

2210
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Tainan is different

2211
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
sunny

2212
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
number of days

2213
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
That

2214
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Taiwan does

2215
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
english day

2216
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
than other countries

2217
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
come more

2218
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
mean to say

2219
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
your solar panel

2220
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
to recycle

2221
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
I need money to invest

2222
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
It used to be said that it might take 15 years to recycle

2223
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
down to the original

2224
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
a fifth of the price

2225
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,260
Can be recycled in five years

2226
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:02,560
that's good

2227
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:03,660
then if you

2228
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:04,720
you put it on a

2229
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,560
A place where there is not much sunlight

2230
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:08,700
That might take ten years to recycle

2231
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:12,300
So it's all a consideration

2232
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:14,600
but

2233
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:18,360
If we put these facilities

2234
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,960
We are contracted to a company

2235
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:23,900
It will definitely do the actuarial calculation of the cost

2236
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,360
For example, wind power

2237
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:26,960
no one would have dared

2238
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:27,500
right

2239
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:28,600
wow you want to say

2240
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,000
this wind power

2241
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,200
One set up

2242
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:33,800
Hundreds of millions in one sitting

2243
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:34,400
right

2244
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,100
then you start talking

2245
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:39,600
How soon can I recycle, right?

2246
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,800
What about especially

2247
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,600
the government is pushing

2248
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:43,900
Because you are taking pictures of this windmill on the road

2249
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:48,400
Still have to fight a lot

2250
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,500
So what our government is doing now is

2251
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,100
ok then i'll go offshore

2252
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,200
do it on the sea

2253
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:55,800
Then do it on the sea

2254
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:58,300
that cost maybe three times

2255
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:59,400
especially Taiwan

2256
01:43:59,400 --> 01:43:59,900
past

2257
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,500
Without this deep sea construction and these technologies

2258
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:07,500
But you go and see

2259
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
If you drive from the highway

2260
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:11,500
When it's time to stop and say

2261
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:13,500
Hey, there are many windmills over there

2262
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:16,500
But there are two windmills in the sea

2263
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,500
And those two windmills are

2264
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:21,000
A company in Taiwan called Shango

2265
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:23,000
to put it up

2266
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:26,000
OK, originally, before that

2267
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,500
Many foreign companies are afraid to enter

2268
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:30,500
That is, is this possible?

2269
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:32,500
There is a typhoon in Taiwan, what is it?

2270
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Uedo spent a lot of money, the cost of learning

2271
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
After building those two windmills together

2272
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Now everyone including Denmark, including Germany, Siemens has come in

2273
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Everyone Comes to Bid for Taiwan's Wind Power

2274
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:51,500
So, this thing is basically a cost

2275
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
It's the same with solar

2276
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,000
If the sun is strong and you have a lot of sunshine

2277
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Of course your cost will be reduced

2278
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
but

2279
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Don't worry too much, let those companies decide whether he has to come or not

2280
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:13,000
If someone is willing to invest, it is obviously worth it

2281
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Of course, apart from sunlight, your unit price, the unit price of solar panels has been falling

2282
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Then again, all your government measures, and how long you have been ordered, actually have a relationship, okay?

2283
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Can you use the microphone, others can't hear it, press it, press the green one

2284
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:50,000
OK, thank you, then the things we usually recycle, paper, can be recycled, right?

2285
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Scrap iron can be recycled, which solar panels can be recycled, can it be

2286
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I heard it's not possible

2287
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Everything can be recycled, but after you recycle

2288
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:06,000
what are you doing

2289
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,000
For example, you said that our previous

2290
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,000
We call it Pai Tan Gu Xia, that canned food, what?

2291
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Even the glass is recycled

2292
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
It's good to recycle and use

2293
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
but for a while

2294
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
The recycling price is not high

2295
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
hospital is low

2296
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
That is to say, have you reused it after recycling?

2297
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
to what extent

2298
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,000
That thing is actually worth it

2299
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
we went to develop

2300
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
That is, you will see game companies

2301
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
He specializes in recycling

2302
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Then if he succeeds, you will find out that

2303
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Wow, he can really turn trash into gold

2304
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Wow, we admire that very much

2305
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,000
because he did you know that

2306
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
The best country in the world

2307
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
called Taiwan

2308
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
ok then do you know why

2309
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Tzu Chi

2310
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Tzu Chi volunteers

2311
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,400
especially in rural areas

2312
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:03,400
it's hard for you to imagine saying

2313
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:05,400
you know that

2314
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:07,200
Is the political performance law

2315
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:09,400
There are a lot of things we don't necessarily agree on

2316
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:10,900
the meaning of the word

2317
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:14,300
But he once said that

2318
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:17,200
do recycling

2319
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:20,600
just doing meritorious deeds

2320
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:23,200
So many volunteers

2321
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:24,400
while he was doing this

2322
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,700
indeed to the whole society

2323
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:28,900
make a great contribution

2324
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:31,500
what do we have to do

2325
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:35,100
Some messages continue to say that he bullies the weak

2326
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:36,200
That means

2327
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,300
so i say i'm not quite

2328
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:40,000
agree with everything he does

2329
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,300
but his

2330
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:42,400
recycle this thing

2331
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,100
If it wasn't for continuing to bring up

2332
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:46,900
Taiwan does not have such a good situation

2333
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:48,000
you know

2334
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,500
I just came back from India two weeks ago

2335
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:53,400
That

2336
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:55,300
India also has beautiful places

2337
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:56,800
then you say

2338
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:58,900
a pile of garbage over there a pile of garbage

2339
01:47:58,900 --> 01:47:59,900
then don't say that

2340
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
the last time i went to india

2341
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
one of my own students

2342
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
read TIGP

2343
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
well done here

2344
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
then to india

2345
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
do we just live in a car

2346
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
after dinner

2347
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Everyone was eating in the car

2348
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
I ate six or seven lunch boxes

2349
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
to a place

2350
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
he just opened the car door

2351
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
that kind of bento

2352
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
I took a look

2353
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,000
startled say

2354
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
What are you doing

2355
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
No, everyone is like this

2356
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,000
that

2357
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
that

2358
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,000
everyone's eco-friendly

2359
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Consciousness not yet

2360
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
does not exist yet

2361
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
That

2362
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
so

2363
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
actual contribution

2364
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
in that respect

2365
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
I affirmed to him

2366
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
OK

2367
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
come please

2368
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
professor has a

2369
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Can

2370
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
I have a question

2371
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Many Koran soldiers in Taiwan

2372
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Then a mining of this Koran soldier

2373
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Are you currently in

2374
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,520
Therefore, relevant units are studying

2375
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:04,340
This is the first question

2376
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:06,280
The second question is

2377
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:09,620
Magma An underground vault in Yangmingshan

2378
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:12,980
The magma basement is 70,000 square kilometers

2379
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:14,360
so big

2380
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:16,000
it's lava fever

2381
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,360
Is there any international institution doing research

2382
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:20,520
Thank you, the geothermal heat is what you said

2383
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:21,860
Not necessarily lava heat

2384
01:49:21,860 --> 01:49:23,760
yes it is

2385
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,660
good

2386
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:27,300
The first Koran soldiers

2387
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:30,800
Kelan soldiers, we call them

2388
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:32,100
First

2389
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:34,700
A, eh, is it the A bowl? It's not the A bowl

2390
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:36,800
Is Kelanbing a bowl?

2391
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:39,300
It's a bowl, sorry

2392
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:41,000
A bowl

2393
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,200
Of course it is because in the depths of the sea

2394
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:46,200
under a certain pressure

2395
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:48,600
then the presented

2396
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:52,100
These liquid cups

2397
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:54,900
then we also have someone to go

2398
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:56,900
go

2399
01:49:56,900 --> 01:50:00,000
Go get it out and show it to everyone

2400
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,540
That's not it, it's like scooping up sea water

2401
01:50:04,540 --> 01:50:07,060
right away, isn't it?

2402
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:11,040
Well, you need to find out more carefully

2403
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:15,720
You have to bring it up from such a deep sea

2404
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:19,140
This is a great technical difficulty

2405
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:21,640
second bowl

2406
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:23,120
we will all talk

2407
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:24,500
if you don't handle it well

2408
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:27,440
Then let part of it go up into the air

2409
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:32,080
The impact of Bowl A on global warming

2410
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:37,600
100 times more than carbon dioxide

2411
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:40,160
It's the one that absorbs infrared rays

2412
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,640
Our name is Cross section, very high

2413
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:44,960
So if it goes into the air

2414
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:47,840
that's another question

2415
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,560
Let me give you an example

2416
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:50,840
i watched a video

2417
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:56,280
Even Japan, they are also interested in studying this armored soldier

2418
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:58,360
Of course you can think of Azhi

2419
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:59,960
Japanese technology they are in

2420
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,700
A lot has been done in all aspects

2421
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:07,200
Japan in order to study this foot bowl ice

2422
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:10,240
Later found out that doing research at sea

2423
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:12,240
the cost is too high

2424
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:14,500
then he ran to canada

2425
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:19,040
Alberta, Canada

2426
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:22,400
on their glacier

2427
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:26,040
Drill down on the ground to get a foot bowl of ice

2428
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:29,880
They've been doing research there for ten years

2429
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:30,580
OK

2430
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:33,080
That is to say, the research on the foot bowl ice

2431
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:34,280
I have no idea

2432
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:37,680
That is to say, take a look and say from the Japanese they

2433
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:39,880
spent ten years

2434
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:42,440
Stationed in Canada to do research here

2435
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:43,840
today we just say

2436
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:47,780
The east coast also has foot bowl ice

2437
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:52,680
They're talking about how little work we've done

2438
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:54,880
far less than others

2439
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:56,580
then i didn't answer your question

2440
01:51:56,580 --> 01:51:58,220
Is that possible?

2441
01:51:58,220 --> 01:51:59,920
But at least what I'm going to say is that

2442
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:09,000
If you want to use it, you have to pay a considerable price to know it and study it, okay?

2443
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Then you will secondly refer to the magma in Yangmingshan, they said that I don’t know much about it

2444
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Well, if you are hot, there are people going to invest in a certain place in Yilan now

2445
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:32,000
It is to make clear water, and to make a geothermal power generation, which is different from the thermoelectricity I talked about.

2446
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:40,000
It draws out the heat to make a traditional generator

2447
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Now some people are doing that research, so is it possible for Yang Mingshan to be better? I don’t know

2448
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:00,000
OK, just to ask, there are some companies in Taiwan

2449
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Lin Jian's company

2450
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
currently in

2451
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Develop commercial space rockets

2452
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Currently for space rockets

2453
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
development prospects

2454
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Can you analyze it

2455
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
inside my speech

2456
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Although there is talk of spaceships

2457
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
but with the rocket

2458
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
two yards

2459
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
but as far as i know

2460
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
For example, explain

2461
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Explain that there is a professor Wu Zongxin

2462
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
I know him

2463
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Because he's my junior on the infected team

2464
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
National Taiwan University infection team

2465
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
he is the one

2466
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
the middle one

2467
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
key person

2468
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,000
why did he do this

2469
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
why did he do research

2470
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
well done too

2471
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
why do that

2472
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Of course he is important

2473
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
one country

2474
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
is there a way to launch a rocket

2475
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
space

2476
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
this is a

2477
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,880
my country did i land on the moon

2478
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,880
did i land on mars

2479
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:07,880
it's a big milestone

2480
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:12,680
Of course you if the rocket can go up, like North Korea

2481
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:13,960
right

2482
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:15,880
it went up

2483
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:20,200
America has to be in awe of its three points

2484
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:23,760
its nuclear bomb succeeded

2485
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:26,280
this is amazing

2486
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:28,440
it's not just nuclear bombs

2487
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:30,880
its clear bomb

2488
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:33,400
one is fission

2489
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:36,120
it's nuclear fusion

2490
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:37,800
That's much more powerful

2491
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:40,320
it proves to you

2492
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:43,200
so many milestones

2493
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:47,160
then if we have a way

2494
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:53,080
successfully launched a rocket into space

2495
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:55,960
yes has its importance

2496
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:57,320
That

2497
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:59,320
I don't need to talk about it later, what are you going to do?

2498
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
I will do it for peaceful purposes

2499
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
I can't tell

2500
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
I'm doing it for defense

2501
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I don't hit people but if someone hits me

2502
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
then i think i will fight back

2503
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
something like

2504
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
then his story is kind of interesting

2505
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Do you know where his funds come from?

2506
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Jiaotong University

2507
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Jiaotong University is not a school

2508
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:26,000
That's what they're working on launching rockets

2509
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
want money

2510
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Basically, it's all about national honor.

2511
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Then he is not

2512
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Do you know where his money comes from?

2513
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Private fundraising, have you ever invested?

2514
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
None of us invested. How did he raise money?

2515
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
there is a taiwanese

2516
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,000
He went to the Soviet Union very early

2517
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:52,000
to do business

2518
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
And then this 1989

2519
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,000
the end of the cold war

2520
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
the collapse of the soviet union

2521
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
sell it in the country

2522
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:06,000
He used that agency to buy a bunch of oil fields

2523
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
now he has a lot of oil fields now

2524
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Of course the oil fields are producing oil all the time.

2525
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
So when he came back a little bit, he talked to a few people

2526
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Taiwan needs rockets

2527
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Then I'll give you 100 million

2528
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
you go away with one million

2529
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Then my student is like this

2530
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
One day the boss said

2531
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
I give you two benzes

2532
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Then you have one

2533
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Then start asking money every year to do it

2534
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
I admire it very much

2535
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
that means he is meaningful

2536
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Aren't they like box bombs, right?

2537
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Box bombs are not always head-on

2538
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,000
but the rocket

2539
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
I remember needing

2540
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,000
we should have some dreams

2541
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
good

2542
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
I think it's time to stop here

2543
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Is there a problem with the network

2544
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Is there a problem with the network

2545
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,000
maybe no one is watching

2546
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
right

2547
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
no problem

2548
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
no problem

2549
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
yes

2550
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Did you prepare it yourself?

2551
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
good

2552
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Internet says

2553
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:11,000
BMW installs thermoelectric system on balloon

2554
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:14,000
car car

2555
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
He said that the electricity of these thermoelectric systems

2556
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Save them all and when there is enough electricity

2557
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Just start the motor and that's it

2558
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
It's like making a kind of thermoelectric

2559
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Hybrid system

2560
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Is this better than the current one?

2561
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,000
The Hybrid system is more cost-effective, which probably means this

2562
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
then i think

2563
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
He talks about BMW

2564
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Since the ranking is very high, I just talked about 70% of the

2565
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:47,000
It's all waste heat, you even need a cooler

2566
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
This water tank is to cool it, then you said there is a way to put it

2567
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,000
part of the recycling, but currently

2568
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
About 5% can be recycled

2569
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Then you become electricity, the 5% electricity is of course

2570
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,400
It's better to make up less

2571
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:04,720
You charge it, fill up your electrons

2572
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:07,060
Or it's good for other purposes

2573
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:10,280
The only problem right now is

2574
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:12,420
The material itself is too expensive

2575
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:14,920
how do we find

2576
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,300
The element that is more abundant on the surface

2577
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:21,420
Then reduce the cost if the key player is like this

2578
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:25,440
I think everyone is deeply concerned about this today.

2579
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:28,500
Realize that this energy costs money

2580
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:30,800
Energy saving also costs money

2581
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:31,800
So I

2582
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:35,440
follow today's talk, I want to help our dean

2583
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:38,340
This Saturday, last Saturday

2584
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:40,800
He made a very important point, that is,

2585
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:44,640
To save the global warming crisis

2586
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:48,000
There is one very important addition to all these studies

2587
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,300
Everyone needs to adjust mentally

2588
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:54,200
That means we have to slightly modify the

2589
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:56,400
pattern of our lives

2590
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:58,200
Like he gave a few examples

2591
01:58:58,200 --> 01:58:59,800
it's very simple

2592
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Do you want to turn it up one degree

2593
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Do you want to think more about building a large and medium transportation system when you go out?

2594
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:10,000
And eat more vegetables and fruits and less meat

2595
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Especially the beef he choked

2596
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Don't underestimate this

2597
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Because if more people do

2598
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Then his consumption of the whole energy

2599
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Of course it will help a lot

2600
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
So it's pretty comprehensive

2601
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
I am also very touched today

2602
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,000
That is to say, everyone is so concerned about energy issues.

2603
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,000
But from Mr. Chen's speech just now, we also know that

2604
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
He is actually a very complex

2605
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,000
It's not that a new technology is necessarily better

2606
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Must be because the new technology is more expensive

2607
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
That's not something any technology can solve.

2608
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
He is actually a very comprehensive question

2609
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
There are many young students here

2610
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
This looks like a lot of potential

2611
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
We hope that we can also invest in research in this area

2612
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Our Chinese language also has many teams doing research in this area

2613
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:00,000
But he needs long-term hard work

2614
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,680
Okay then again we take this opportunity to thank speaker Yan

2615
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:05,000
Thank you all for participating

2616
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Thanks

2617
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,480
Then our next game is this

2618
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:12,980
The next feast of knowledge will be on November 27

2619
02:00:12,980 --> 02:00:15,280
There is another theme we find

2620
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:17,120
Shock-absorbing roof

2621
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:19,520
Special researchers also talk about this nerve

2622
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:23,520
Then I think interested guests can

2623
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:26,320
Or you know someone who is interested and can help us spread the word

2624
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:29,320
November 27 Thank you all thank you

2625
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,000
thank you all
