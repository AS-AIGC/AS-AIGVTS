1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,760
human and physical communities to switch levels where we can supply foodmouths and vegan foods and overcome hunger need.

2
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:48,900
Director Wang Jin-mo plans to present project into the best possible outcome ofana

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
miss of knowledge in september

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So today we're talking about the tax system

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So, I wonder if you have noticed that in July this year

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Sino-British Institute puts forward a proposal for tax reform

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Then this proposal has aroused a very wide discussion

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well there's a lot of detail in it

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
no way to report them all here i think

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
this

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
part of the tax reform proposal

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's already fermenting

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Especially in the sale and purchase of houses, etc.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You can see this related issue

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, it's already fermenting

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
be directly or indirectly affected by it

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The main moderator of this proposal is Academician Wang Ping in the United States

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The person in charge in Taiwan is the specific researcher Peng Xinkun present here.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
he is here this year

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Well, some of them are also Yang Jiancheng present here.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
identification

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
already responsible

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Colleagues feel that Taiwan's tax system

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There have been quite a few problems with the structure for a long time

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There are also quite a few unfair issues

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And the most important thing is that the taxman's lies are too strong

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
make the government unable to have enough power

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to do what should be done public

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
or aspects of welfare

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The government's administrative tools have also been severely shot

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So it's a very complex and very difficult problem

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
worthy of further discussion

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Today we invite the Academia Sinica

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Special Review Fellow at the Institute of Economics

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Professor Yang Jiancheng came to give a lecture

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Professor Yang is a very distinguished economist

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I think anyone here who has a major in economics knows

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
he is an excellent economist

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He is in this

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Virginia Politec

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's the school where Koreans shot and killed a lot of people

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He is Virginia Polytech's 1989

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,600
PhD

44
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,800
Then go back to Academia Sinica

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,600
Has been serving the contract

46
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,280
In addition to being a member of the Institute of Economics, Academia Sinica

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,000
Outside of Terby Fellows

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
It is also an official university finance department

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,720
Chair Professor

50
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,600
His specialty is public economics

51
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
and political economy

52
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,760
Professor Wan from Academia Sinica

53
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,800
From associate researcher to special researcher

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,440
He has received many important academic honors

55
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,000
Including Ministry of Education Academic Award 1994

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,600
Including three NSC End Research Awards

57
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,680
including the National Science Council's 2002

58
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,760
Extraordinary research awards and more

59
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,720
so he is a

60
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,320
medal-filled economist

61
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,800
A topic he is going to talk about today

62
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,400
in fact it is important

63
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,720
Income tax versus consumption tax

64
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,400
So as we prepare this

65
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,640
tax reform

66
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,320
time for tax reform proposals

67
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,480
there is an academician

68
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,600
Fellows in the United States

69
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,000
He just thinks

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,120
GST should be used as a starting point

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,960
Others are of course this opinion is too strong

72
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Didn't get everyone's credit

73
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,460
So these issues are very complicated

74
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,460
we now use applause

75
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,460
Welcome Professor Yang Jiancheng to us

76
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,460
Thank you all for coming

77
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,960
this time the speech

78
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,960
i just mentioned that

79
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
I am Berzene Tech B.Ed

80
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
It was a Korean who killed many people

81
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
Later my junior college

82
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,960
tell me

83
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
because of that

84
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
Make our school more famous

85
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,960
So in the future recruit new students

86
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,960
Yellow tuna is more active

87
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
It might not have been that famous

88
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
for killing a bunch of people

89
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
So it becomes more famous

90
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,960
So everyone is more enthusiastic about yellow tuna

91
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
Thank you all for coming

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That is to say, let’s talk about it a little bit wider than this.

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But let me talk about an idea about a center

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So Luo Rui is not a very good Rui in Taiwan

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
not very good ray

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We'll get to that in a minute but it has a lot of problems

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Well Sorori is not very good Ray

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So is it possible to subsidize or help this Rui with other Rui?

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It’s probably a central issue that I’m going to talk about today.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll probably talk about why Solori isn't that good

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why it is possible to use other ri to help or subsidize the words of sorori

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Maybe we can make our Rui characters better

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What I just said is that what I probably talked about is not just about this

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm probably a little wider

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I would like to mention some information now

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,260
I probably won't say it, you should know

107
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:10,660
It's our debt

108
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,160
This is where we equal the central

109
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,040
we last time

110
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,600
It was just mentioned by Wang Wu

111
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,460
He has this picture in the report

112
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,760
you can draw that is to say

113
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,360
our words in 81

114
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,540
He takes that as the unit

115
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,300
Look at the words in 1981

116
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,960
about 0 years 57

117
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,300
In other words, about 0.5 megabytes

118
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,000
you can draw that is to say

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,800
whose time passes

120
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,000
You can draw me higher and higher

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,700
Now it's about 5 trillion

122
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,760
Some people say this is not very accurate

123
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,560
Because it also includes, for example, some

124
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,600
old insurance loss catholic

125
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
future problems

126
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,160
But dare not do anything

127
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
tell us here

128
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,800
You see, this growth rate is quite fast.

129
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,900
And you see he is going up

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,040
how about going backwards

131
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,360
We are now roughly every year

132
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,040
about every year

133
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,840
The one from 200 billion to 300 billion is equal to

134
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,000
Equal to insufficient tax or other income

135
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,520
In other words, among our expenditures

136
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,080
probably probably

137
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,640
200 to 300 billion

138
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,720
It depends on our year

139
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,960
tax good bad bad

140
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
don't remember good words

141
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,040
tax is better

142
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,840
Remember that when you are poor, your taxes are poor.

143
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,720
But probably as short as

144
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,360
200 to 300 billion

145
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,080
The ratio is the same

146
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,080
If this proportion

147
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,960
That is to say, he is here

148
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,640
The average proportion of GDP in terms of the previous three years

149
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,880
you see you know

150
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,840
is also an upward

151
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,840
if you go up

152
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,280
You see, it was around 13:00 at the beginning

153
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,280
Now the word is probably in

154
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,840
in a short period of time

155
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,800
Now about 3 times and 4 times more

156
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,920
to 37 o'clock

157
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,320
this number

158
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,920
i think it's ok

159
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,280
better than the rest of the world

160
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,840
But the worry is that this trend

161
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,120
that trend

162
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,000
This trend means

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It is equivalent to more than thirty-seven points from a total amount

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You are better than other countries in the world

165
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Like Japan, it is more than 100%

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
better than many other countries

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But its rising figures make us more worried

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
we are more worried

169
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
ok this is what we mean

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
My tax burden ratio in recent years

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This is also what we have in the report of the Central Committee

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Probably you can draw until about eleven or twelve

173
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Probably since 1991

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
this number

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
How does it compare to other countries?

176
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
let's take a look

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
This is probably how many countries we have

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Take a look like the Republic of China and the United States

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What we say in Taiwan is probably like what we just said

180
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Since 1991, it has been around eleven o'clock

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
In the past it was higher

182
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's after fifteen o'clock

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,520
You can see and go down slowly

184
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,400
go down slowly

185
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,600
It includes A and B

186
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,120
A and B

187
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,400
Because if it's past 12 o'clock

188
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,800
That doesn't include us, for example, paying some annuities

189
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,400
paid some health insurance fees

190
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,680
because other countries

191
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,400
Annuity payments are basically part of a tax

192
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,040
the annuity you pay the health insurance you pay

193
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,160
basically

194
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,600
But let's split it into two columns

195
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,400
As far as column A is concerned

196
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,960
Just doesn't include social security contributions

197
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,080
including not including annuity

198
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,240
health insurance not included

199
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,160
This V course includes

200
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,280
If you look at the comparison

201
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,920
Even if we look at it with Vran

202
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,440
Compared with other countries

203
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,680
like in Japan, to the twenties

204
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,920
Thirty in German

205
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,840
words of anglicization

206
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,240
Anyway, you talk to France to more than ten

207
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,080
Nordic countries

208
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,280
are full height

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,820
Now I think Taiwan has a big problem

210
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,000
That is to say, the people have quite high unreasonable demands on society.

211
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I hope the government will provide a lot of social welfare

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But it's hard on angle tax

213
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This is not unreasonable

214
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
not without reason

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This is equivalent to the problem of a single machine

216
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
For example, if you talk about Taiwan Telecom

217
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
you want to raise your electricity price

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
In the case of CNPC, if the oil price is raised

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It is often said that

220
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
you put some of your internal

221
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Fluctuating line draft without calculation

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Let’s fix the problem of the single machine first.

223
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
This is not so clear anymore

224
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But if we are comparing

225
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Probably except for comparisons like Singapore

226
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
is special like city-state outside

227
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Probably much lower

228
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
you can take a look

229
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That is to say, it is not very high

230
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
but then again

231
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Although this proportion is not very high

232
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But who will bear the burden?

233
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't think this is as low as I thought.

234
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We know that Taiwan's

235
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If there is a sleeping system, you should be small, including sleeping.

236
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
including sleeping when reporting to sleep

237
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
you just go online

238
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
For example, your buckle feet are flat

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
when you report to sleep

240
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
He will automatically tell you how many hands you have

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
where did those hands come from

242
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
They all come with a single buckle.

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Is it flattened?

244
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
there is a ser party

245
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
there is a third person in english

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
you work for a certain company

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
when the company pays you for water first

248
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
He just pays you the first part of the water

249
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
report him to, say, the IRS

250
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The IRS has that information.

251
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
let's wait and see

252
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Taiwan has a structural problem

253
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That is, there are many small and medium-sized enterprises in Taiwan.

254
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
SMEs this thing

255
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's like being your own boss

256
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The function of this ser party is not lost

257
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
otherwise it means

258
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
To be able to hold your hand

259
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Why can I get

260
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
just through this ser party

261
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
just define

262
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
When you pay your salary in that company

263
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
He reported this information to the Ministry of Finance.

264
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
or when the company pays you a bonus

265
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
He reported this information to the Ministry of Finance.

266
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
They know that a lot of people don't have this social party

267
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
For example, Sale Impointment

268
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Now that you're the boss, he won't have this social party

269
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So this probably won't go away.

270
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So you see that the tax rate seems to be very high

271
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But it is believed that most

272
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Most of it is due to the exchange of salary

273
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So this is not very high

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But if you count it on the payroll

275
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Maybe not as low as imagined

276
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
not as low as imagined

277
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
This is also a big problem

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Then let's see

279
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That is to say, this is one of the pictures just now. Take a look.

280
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Basically you can draw to get us is very low

281
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
In other words the size of our government

282
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
Compared with other countries, it is very low.

283
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,840
very low

284
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,140
Yes Japan

285
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,680
look and compare

286
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,960
like danish words

287
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,520
denmark like nordic countries words

288
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,060
at 50 is really over 50

289
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,080
This is normal in the West

290
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,640
So their social welfare is doing well

291
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,920
not without reason

292
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,460
because in your hand

293
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,740
most are taxed

294
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,020
pay taxes

295
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,300
But Taiwan's problem is

296
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,320
pay little tax

297
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,620
but hope that the government will provide high welfare

298
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,440
This gap creates a big problem

299
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,800
OK

300
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,080
this is

301
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,140
Of course, Taiwan now has another problem, that is,

302
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,040
equal to

303
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,240
A problem of uneven distribution

304
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,040
This is of course from before

305
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,320
You see what it says here

306
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,120
The board with the highest hand and the back of the board with the lowest

307
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,900
on the rise

308
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,680
this rise

309
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,220
of course you can draw

310
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,760
this rise

311
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,300
somewhat likely to be exaggerated

312
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,320
a bit exaggerated

313
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,120
The main reason is that you can draw

314
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,600
in the early days

315
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,120
that population

316
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It is not the same as the later population structure

317
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
For example, in the early days, it may have been a relatively large family.

318
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Smaller family now

319
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Everyone wants to say that my hands are already taller.

320
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
so this may be an exaggeration

321
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But the main problem is that

322
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You can see that the trend is indeed going up

323
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
However, the upward trend

324
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's not a phenomenon of Taiwan retreating

325
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This phenomenon occurs in many countries around the world

326
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Let's look at the picture below

327
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This picture is also interesting

328
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It is in the information of your Doctrine

329
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Among the materials of the Doctrine of Doctrine

330
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It puts equal to a lock among

331
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It is mainly divided into two parts

332
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
part of what we see here

333
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
remuneration for bereavement

334
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The general salary is the salary for the deceased

335
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
normal salary

336
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
There are other locks

337
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Other locks include profits earned by the company

338
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and interest

339
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Anyway, other locks

340
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
ground rent etc.

341
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This is collectively called operating surplus

342
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Anyway, let's say these two together

343
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,840
is what we get

344
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,000
Anyway, besides sleeping

345
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,440
probably these two

346
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,800
In addition to sleeping and the so-called depreciation

347
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,240
It's probably mainly these two.

348
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,560
hand

349
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,120
You got these two

350
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,320
not these two

351
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,240
Let's say these two have a trend

352
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,880
what trend

353
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,480
You see this social staff pay

354
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,840
Around the time of the 19th year

355
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,880
1989 reached a petition

356
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,680
But then you see the whole trend and go down

357
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,320
what does this mean

358
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,960
This means that

359
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,040
economic growth

360
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,440
For example, economic growth

361
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,800
we are growing

362
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,200
belonging to labor income

363
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,400
part of salary

364
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,480
it is getting less and less

365
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:41,920
Fewer and fewer

366
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,760
in other words

367
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,920
For example, it is equivalent to earning 100 yuan

368
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,200
for 100 pieces

369
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,920
you see at this time

370
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,600
it takes half

371
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,280
right

372
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,600
about 50

373
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,520
accounted for half

374
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,640
right

375
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,560
but then what

376
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,800
a coat is falling

377
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
On the other hand, this is rising

378
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,940
This phenomenon is not unique to Taiwan.

379
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,700
phenomenon in many countries

380
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,060
So I saw this case earlier

381
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,000
Seeing equals the rising gap is getting bigger and bigger

382
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,860
about is to say

383
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,020
For example, economic growth

384
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
say 3%

385
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,440
or 5%

386
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,100
Many people say that the five senses

387
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,060
because of the money

388
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,260
My salary didn't increase either

389
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,900
Where will those 5% and 3% growth go?

390
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
In other words not universally enjoyed

391
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You can see that the early days of Taiwan were not like this

392
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Early Taiwan

393
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
In the early stage of Taiwan, there were many opportunities at that time

394
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Almost I'm as small as among my peers

395
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
as long as high school

396
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
don't even go to college

397
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
At that time everyone earned college

398
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
At that time there were many chances

399
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
as long as you work hard

400
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
not that kind

401
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Let's just say how it is

402
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
In other words you just

403
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
about that time

404
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
equal to many chances

405
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
everyone earns college

406
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
good

407
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,760
we learned to read very high

408
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,160
Doesn't necessarily make more money

409
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,720
But then we heard

410
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,360
What fat cat is not a fat cat question

411
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,600
But now you can come back to the whole standstill

412
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,500
there is this phenomenon

413
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,300
This phenomenon is tantamount to saying that

414
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,160
I didn't earn the money

415
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,460
he made money

416
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,320
This phenomenon is also

417
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,800
We see these two phenomena

418
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,460
actually a

419
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,360
But it's right that Taiwan has its own problems.

420
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Don't talk about unique problems

421
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,360
why is it like this

422
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,620
why is it like this

423
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,020
As you can imagine there are of course many factors behind this

424
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,520
But probably globalization is probably

425
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,160
presumably a factor of a running jump

426
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,060
globalization

427
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,220
Because labor is more expensive in your place

428
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,660
I won't set up a factory in your place

429
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,520
I went to other places to set up factories

430
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,460
But there are many factors behind

431
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,760
But there is this phenomenon

432
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,360
How to overcome this phenomenon

433
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,020
How to deal with it

434
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,560
This is also a pretty big problem

435
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,520
pretty big problem

436
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,440
Yes, and I want to make a special point about the previous one

437
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,800
That is to say, among the income of the Taiwan government

438
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,240
Taiwan's government revenue is about 2 trillion a year

439
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,760
2 trillion, other than 2 trillion including taxes

440
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,800
Ladies and gentlemen, what is the contribution of the central bank among the two trillion?

441
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,800
You may never have thought that contributing is tithe

442
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:33,800
In other words, two balls are the central bank's surplus

443
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:40,600
So if you think about it, we generally imagine that the central bank is the monetary policy

444
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,600
It is to control the exchange rate interest rate those policies

445
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,200
But the central bank has now become a tax unit that seems to be quite important

446
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,600
This is the unit that collects money

447
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,800
Because out of a hundred dollars, out of a hundred dollars spent by the entire government

448
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,760
Ten out of one hundred yuan of income is from the central bank

449
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,720
200 billion is the contribution of the central bank

450
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,300
If you think about it, this one is very special

451
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,620
It is a very special phenomenon in the world

452
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,820
But Yang Yangyang said, he would say

453
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,420
I have a lot of foreign exchange reserves, and my base is very good

454
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,820
But from the point of view of monetary scholars

455
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,180
that is also a tax

456
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:15,740
Why?

457
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,100
If Yang Yangyang wants to make that money

458
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,980
He is bound to drive down interest rates

459
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,420
This is like a dispute

460
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,460
there is an argument

461
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,140
But look, this is not a long-term occasion

462
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,100
You see, Yang Yangyang contributed one of ten papers, 200 billion

463
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,740
Among the two trillion, two hundred billion is Yang Xing

464
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,940
this is very special

465
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,740
This can't be long

466
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,860
So if you take away Yang Yangyang's share

467
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,260
that deficit is worse

468
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,780
As I just said, the annual deficit is about 200 billion to 300 billion

469
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,780
If you take Yang Yangyang away

470
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:51,060
Probably suddenly increased to 400 billion, 500 billion

471
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:55,340
And this is really, I think it's a pretty serious problem.

472
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,300
Because Yang Yangyang has such a big burden

473
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,060
you can tell

474
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I guess and intuit it too

475
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,840
That is to say, he may interfere with one of his monetary policies

476
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,520
yes, should have, for example should have done

477
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,120
But considering that if you do this, it won't work out.

478
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,400
I have less money or something

479
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,200
he will be restricted

480
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,800
So this is not a long time

481
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,480
But I want POINOUT to point it out

482
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,000
The number of times in Taiwan is quite serious.

483
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,600
Because the central bank contributed 200 billion

484
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,000
If you remove the part of the central bank

485
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,200
The number of times per year is 4

486
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,640
Equal to this difference becomes

487
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,280
Not 200 billion, hundreds of billions

488
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,240
Become 2000 equal to 400 billion to 500 billion

489
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,240
so it looks serious

490
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,560
serious

491
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,320
Well by this I mean a simple one

492
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,920
Of course there is a feeling

493
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,440
that feeling means

494
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,000
For example, we follow

495
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,320
One that produces a compilation of different faculties

496
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,680
The finances of our Republic of China

497
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,880
look at it

498
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,480
Probably tax accounted for more than 73.0

499
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,880
india also india

500
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,960
it's serious

501
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,540
I just said it's past twelve o'clock

502
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,040
The central bank contributes 10%

503
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,740
Contribute 10%

504
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,300
It means that the central bank is the most profitable state-owned institution

505
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,500
it's really special

506
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,140
maybe i thought maybe in

507
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,500
It's also a surprise that I'm knowing

508
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,700
Surprised to know

509
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,700
It's hard for ordinary people to imagine

510
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,940
The central bank turned out to be the most profitable business unit

511
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,580
But the damage that this says is that

512
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,420
A tax on locks is probably in favor

513
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,220
Business tax praise so much

514
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:38,420
These 30 years add up to about half

515
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,620
But what I just said at the beginning is to say

516
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,020
The destruction I'm going to talk about today is the tax on locks

517
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,820
not as good as we thought

518
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,420
let's take a look

519
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,420
The tax of the lock is theoretically an ideal tax word

520
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,220
Why is it an ideal tax word?

521
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,380
because it can vary depending on the taxpayer's situation

522
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,380
deliberately different persuasion

523
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,380
For example, your home

524
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,960
do you have children

525
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Is there a major disaster every year

526
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,800
So or any sick medical expenses

527
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,840
particularly high

528
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,280
We have a so-called special deduction

529
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,360
Not a special deduction

530
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,960
You can deduct it immediately

531
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,320
Because it depends on your persuasion how many people to support

532
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,680
how is your condition

533
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,120
So it can move forward according to different people

534
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,080
I tax it differently

535
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,960
This tax is theoretically called a direct tax

536
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,280
direct tax

537
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,120
because according to your condition

538
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,920
I design my tax system

539
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,520
If there is a tax, we villains generally can't scold

540
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,840
For example, if you go to buy a

541
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
For example, LV bags

542
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,120
you like to buy

543
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,240
Buy LV bags from a rich man

544
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,960
It won't say LV bags this guy is rich

545
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,920
this guy has no money

546
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,040
Maybe there is someone who likes LV bags very much

547
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,600
it has no money

548
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,440
but it also buys a

549
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,240
so it can't see

550
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,920
Anyway, it knows when it sees

551
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,600
Only one L88 was sold

552
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,500
As for who bought it

553
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,600
he can't see

554
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,100
right

555
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,300
So what about general sales tax?

556
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,000
Generally, only the size of one car can be delivered

557
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,500
That is to say, how much are you buying and selling

558
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,300
He is not able to adapt to the different circumstances of the taxpayer

559
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,800
I just said that it's like a tax breaker

560
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,900
I can see how many children you have

561
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,900
did you raise your parents

562
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,700
Did you have any major events this year?

563
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,700
For example, disaster

564
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,200
Are you sick? etc.

565
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,400
he can make an adjustment for you

566
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,600
For example, when you enumerate deductions

567
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,800
You can list your medical expenses and so on.

568
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,500
So he can according to the situation of different people

569
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,600
different taxation

570
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,800
But sales tax is gone

571
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
sales tax anyway

572
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,100
you trade

573
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,400
The tax of the father who has money to buy you is the same

574
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,600
all the same

575
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
So generally speaking

576
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,000
Different taxes cannot be levied according to different situations of taxpayers

577
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,500
indirect tax

578
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,300
This is called Direct Tax

579
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,200
words in english

580
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,800
This is called In Direct Tax

581
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
So theoretically

582
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,100
in theory

583
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,300
Hand tax is a better tax

584
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
because it can advance according to different

585
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
This measure of customer tax means that

586
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
What we traditionally say is

587
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
People with higher income should pay more tax

588
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Those who earn less should pay more

589
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
less tax etc.

590
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The person with the two heads going forward should pay the tax for the head and so on

591
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It can be done differently according to this forward

592
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Just a different design

593
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
But sales tax is not

594
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
No business tax, that is to say

595
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
anyway each of you

596
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yes, you go to a high-end restaurant to eat

597
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You just have to pay five business taxes

598
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It doesn't matter who eats it

599
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You are buying Taiwanese people to eat, so it is the same

600
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I also pay this tax when I eat today

601
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
yes

602
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So in theory

603
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Judgment from the point of view of taxation

604
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The tax in my hand is the excellent business tax

605
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Merit business tax

606
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
But what I'm going to say next is that

607
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
The tax in hand is not as good as we imagined

608
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
let's take a look

609
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
the information i use

610
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
The information used below is from 1994

611
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
China's hand tax approved production and trade information

612
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
because my year happened to be

613
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
make one for the treasury

614
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
just make a plan

615
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,020
But now there is also, now there is a relatively new information

616
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:07,520
But my understanding is not much different, let's take a look at the data of Zengnian

617
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,720
Because the number of places reflected in the data, what is it?

618
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:20,040
Let's take a look at the general guardian of the household

619
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,840
Those who make friends mean, for example, husband and wife, if we come to see husband and wife

620
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,680
As long as your total number of defenders reaches 1.3 million, you can use the data of increasing years to see

621
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,040
You are probably dead and rich in the first half of Taiwan

622
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,760
1.3 million, what is it like? Probably every month when you don’t expect to earn

623
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,400
This does not include any deductions

624
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,840
This gross is equivalent to not deducting anything, for example, how much you have raised children

625
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,040
You're going on vacation and haven't deducted those things yet.

626
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,880
In other words, it is right to calculate that you have made money

627
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,520
You see, you only need to earn about 110,000

628
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's the 10% of rich people

629
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
in other words

630
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
as long as your husband and wife

631
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
If it is a public official

632
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
If the husband and wife are both public servants

633
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
on the tax package

634
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You're probably in the 10% rich

635
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
in other words

636
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
The couple's money for every other diamond

637
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
As long as it exceeds 113,000 yuan

638
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
About 10% of rich people

639
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Think about it, everyone

640
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
This is the rich man you imagine

641
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I guess there is a gap

642
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Both husband and wife are public servants

643
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
probably rich

644
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
when i come

645
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Our rental laboratory also

646
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
tell me

647
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Probably your ancestor and wife

648
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
All the words handed over at the university

649
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
You're probably in the top 5% of rich people.

650
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
out of 100 people

651
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
you're probably in fifth place

652
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
No. 6 is right

653
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
This is the rich man we imagined

654
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
there is a gap

655
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But it appears on the tax information

656
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
that's the number

657
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,100
The member of the tax return information is you see you as long as each

658
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,300
It's not your money, it's a couple's money

659
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,100
As long as it exceeds 110,000, I don’t know if it’s not more than 100,000 in life

660
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,400
If it exceeds, you probably belong on the tax return.

661
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,800
10% of the rich

662
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,100
10% of the 1% are rich

663
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:21,600
There is a gap between this and our common sense understanding.

664
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,300
If your husband and wife together earn more than 110,000 a month

665
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,300
I think it's okay, it's okay

666
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,400
But it shouldn't be 10% of the money, right?

667
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,100
Also let's look at

668
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,900
In our data about that year

669
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,300
There are about 5.5 million total registered students

670
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,900
The total number of family members has not reached 600,000

671
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,600
About 595,000

672
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,500
About 72.35% of all registered households

673
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,000
In other words

674
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,700
There are approximately 3 out of 40,000 registered households in Taiwan

675
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,700
His monthly household income is less than 50,000 yuan

676
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,000
can you believe this number

677
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,900
Siwenwen is three families, among the 5.5 million households listed on the tax filing information,

678
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,300
Siwen is a family of three, and every couple earns less than 50,000 yuan.

679
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:17,400
This is the tax return information, the presented information,

680
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:23,900
What does this mean? He will ask for a lot, and if he doesn’t have a lot of money, it’s like having a family with four Wen Wen,

681
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,900
I can't earn 50,000 yuan every time, neither the account nor too big,

682
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,900
Every time the husband and wife add up, or the wife does not have a job,

683
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:37,900
Anyway, it means that there are nearly 72.3, and I probably have four Wenwen families,

684
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,900
It’s probably less than 50,000 yuan every time. In other words, what you see here is that,

685
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:47,900
What I saw in the tax returns is that the rich people in Taiwan are not so rich,

686
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:53,900
There are quite a lot of poor people in Taiwan, quite a lot,

687
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:59,900
This is in line with our common sense, our general understanding,

688
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Injury is a big gap

689
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,800
And what we just saw was a

690
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
tax filing information

691
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,760
tax information

692
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,520
we want a

693
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,920
He has a household ratings survey

694
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,720
He also investigates with each other as a unit

695
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,800
each other as a unit

696
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,000
The two surveyed households

697
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,800
The definition sheet is different

698
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,720
It's the family rating of the doctrine department. He has a family unit.

699
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,800
The first tax return has a household unit

700
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,680
but if you think about it

701
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,880
Which household has more units

702
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,040
Because we know taxes are exhausting

703
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,560
so he is exhausted

704
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:38,920
so

705
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,040
if you

706
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,240
If the child has money

707
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,960
Of course you want him

708
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,480
Do not declare together

709
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,160
right

710
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,120
Taxes will be lower if you file separately

711
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,800
Because if you add up your child

712
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,040
because taxes are exhausting

713
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,400
So the added tax rate would be

714
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,480
The tax rate will be higher.

715
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,480
so you can imagine

716
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,920
From a tax point of view

717
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
a family, a family

718
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
He may separate the child to hold

719
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Yes, separate and hug

720
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
he won't drink him up and hug him

721
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
So in theory

722
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Negative numbers on tax returns

723
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
should be more than the family budget

724
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
the negative number defined by

725
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
because you are in the family budget

726
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
when doing research

727
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
In your family, for example

728
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Your husband and wife have a child, and the child has a job

729
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
he sees him as a

730
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
but when filing taxes

731
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That child may be separated from another life insurance

732
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
so in theory

733
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
in theory

734
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
that is

735
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Your

736
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Households subject to tax life insurance

737
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It should be better than the life insurance of family income and expenditure

738
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
more housework

739
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
but anyway

740
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Among the data of the same year

741
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
About 7.1 million households reported household income and expenditure

742
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
what we just said

743
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Taxable life insurance approximately 500

744
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
or Wanhu

745
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
If there are tax shares, there are about 1.6 million households

746
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
legal exchange

747
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
no tax return at all

748
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
no tax return at all

749
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
We know that we were promoting

750
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Not when Ao was in health insurance

751
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
There was an idea at the time that

752
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
We're going to use virtual income to calculate health insurance premiums

753
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I think they were probably scared at the time, that is

754
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
many people get nothing

755
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
or did not report or something

756
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
So I presume an income with you

757
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
virtual income

758
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
But Oboe's Picture

759
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
The whole is to say from the data of 1994

760
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
then it feels like

761
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Hey, talk about rich people

762
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
not so rich

763
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
you only need income

764
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
As long as the monthly income is more than 110,000 points

765
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Less than 120,000

766
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You are probably one of 100 people

767
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You'll be number 10

768
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
you probably said

769
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
in other words

770
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
you're good

771
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
This is what we imagined

772
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Couples add up every month

773
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Earn 110,000

774
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
This is not much, is it?

775
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
As long as your family is a civil servant

776
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Both husband and wife are civil servants

777
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
probably earn that much

778
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,900
Because we see that there are almost three-quarters of more than 72 points

779
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,900
The family income is still less than 50,000 yuan per month

780
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,100
And what about this place, we said

781
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:18,900
The household information reported should be larger than the negative household income information

782
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,900
Suppose we make it equal

783
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:25,900
You also see that there are probably very high negative numbers

784
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,900
No reporting at all, in other words, regardless of its legality

785
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:34,900
That is, it cannot be seen on the report data

786
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,900
This idea, this idea locks the tax machine

787
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,900
It is to be full of seriousness, to erode the idea of ​​full seriousness

788
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,900
In the following example, it is necessary to obtain a confirmation indirectly

789
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,900
an indirect confirmation

790
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,900
This is general science

791
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,900
We know that before Ma Ying-jeou came to power in 2004

792
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,900
While he was running for his credentials, he had an idea

793
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,900
This idea, maybe the student gave him a catch

794
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:09,000
How about this idea? The idea is that they have a N income credit with the United States.

795
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
What is this? This means that you are serious about your work

796
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
but your income is low

797
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
For example, I go to sell McDonald's and work many hours every month.

798
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But the time to sell McDonald's is only 100 yuan

799
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
No matter how much I earn, no matter how many hours I work

800
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
The United States may also earn very low, and it is still very low now

801
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
What about this kind of person? The idea of ​​N income credit is this kind of person

802
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I'll subsidize him

803
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
How to subsidize it? If you earn 100 yuan, I will subsidize you, for example, 20 yuan

804
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
In other words, your income becomes 120 yuan

805
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
This is the so-called N income credit

806
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
This plan has been around for a long time in the United States.

807
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
But the Kundin era greatly expanded it

808
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,200
what is the main idea of ​​this thing

809
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,540
The idea is that it doesn't just give you money

810
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,540
On the contrary, it often has some regulations, that is,

811
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,640
You have to work faster than a certain speed

812
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,000
For example, every other week to exceed an hour

813
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,800
You can enjoy this benefit

814
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,200
So it is not quite the same as the concept of social welfare

815
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,640
Social welfare concept is you don't have money

816
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,440
shall i just give you the money

817
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,040
It is not

818
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,000
It's like saying you're serious about your work

819
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,640
but don't know why

820
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,440
you don't make much money

821
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,840
so i subsidize you

822
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,800
This program is now in the US in Europe

823
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,140
are very popular

824
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,600
Because this scheme is equivalent to

825
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,000
Just make you willing to work

826
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,440
This plan is equivalent to if you do not work

827
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,600
Instead of getting the money

828
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,200
you have to work

829
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,440
And the working speed must exceed a certain standard

830
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,040
You can get this money

831
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,140
This idea was developed when Miku was running for office in 2004

832
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,600
it brings up this thing

833
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,500
It really did when it came on stage

834
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,960
these two

835
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,860
what did you think

836
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,700
It's called the Working Income Supplement for all.

837
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,200
This is generally called the Jianping scheme

838
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,600
His target is over 20 years old

839
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
did not reach the age of 65

840
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,000
full primary earner

841
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,300
For example, Mr. and Mrs.

842
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,900
His personal annual salary is below 300,000

843
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,100
full time worker

844
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,100
So you see he has a rule that says

845
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,500
your annual salary is lower

846
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,200
but full time

847
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,100
In other words, you didn't mean guess what?

848
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,400
It means that you are really doing work.

849
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,800
The working hours are still high

850
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,000
But the money you earn is very low

851
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,700
i will help you

852
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,900
How did you do it?

853
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,800
At that time the practice was

854
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Because he is a social welfare bearer

855
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,400
So the Ministry of the Interior is in charge

856
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,100
How does the Ministry of the Interior use it?

857
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,500
He took the taxation center of the Ministry of Finance as the

858
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,900
Based on fiscal and tax data from 1990

859
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,300
compare

860
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,500
able to screen out qualified candidates

861
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,300
And then through the county and city governments

862
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,000
Active Program Application

863
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
to those who qualify

864
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,920
in other words

865
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,920
It uses this tax information

866
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,920
you go to filter

867
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,920
Assuming you are a full child worker

868
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,920
then your personal salary

869
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
this means

870
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,920
your main paycheck

871
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
Personal annual salary is low

872
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,920
For example, less than 300,000

873
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,920
I'm like

874
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Active Planning Fact Sheet for you

875
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,920
I'm getting ready now

876
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,920
take this NNK

877
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
of the money you make

878
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,920
My government will subsidize you some money

879
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,920
the idea

880
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,840
the idea

881
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,840
we found a big problem

882
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,840
this problem

883
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,840
we would like

884
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
this policy

885
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
not that you apply

886
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
No

887
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,840
It is to filter from fiscal and taxation data

888
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,840
then look at you

889
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
not enough hands

890
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,840
I will take the initiative to inform you that

891
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,840
You are eligible to receive this money

892
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
so not

893
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,840
in other words

894
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
You don't even need to apply.

895
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,840
It informs about proactive programs

896
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,840
just for you

897
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
So the government took the initiative

898
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
Probably the biggest feature of this contraband plan

899
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,760
not you to apply

900
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
then go up to filter

901
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But the place is out of the game

902
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Probably not as good as the so-called Chinese

903
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Therefore, the application materials have an authenticity

904
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
There is a problem with this information

905
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
For example, the China Times on October 3, 1997

906
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
it has a report

907
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
This program appears as the subsidy object for the factory director

908
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Quite a lot

909
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
because you look

910
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
If you go to subsidize

911
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Maybe through the Lichang or something to get to know him

912
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
you have the qualifications

913
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
The consular district on the left is small

914
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
The consular district on the left is of course small

915
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
is this guy rich

916
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Is it rich to get this?

917
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
probably small

918
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So you go and see

919
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
local newspaper at the time

920
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
In many places, the prophecy is directly elected

921
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
why

922
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
why he can get

923
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
i can't take it

924
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
this problem happens

925
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I have no money than him

926
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
why he can get

927
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
i can't take it

928
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
so at that time

929
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
local and central

930
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
For example, the Southern Legislative Council at that time

931
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
just throw the Ministry of the Interior

932
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Disbursed on the practice of subsidizing Hunan

933
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,320
How about that's the Ministry of the Interior?

934
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,320
that's computer choice

935
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,560
I'm a changing profile

936
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,560
I'm choosing

937
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,560
So what about this plan?

938
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,060
It's like being exposed

939
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,560
This code tax is actually full of problems

940
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,860
It reflects only one of the Chinese code tax data

941
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,600
I especially wanted to study the Jianmin plan at that time.

942
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,320
I also went to the Ministry of the Interior to ask him for advice.

943
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,400
Do you have any information

944
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,760
Then how can I refer to

945
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,840
What about the Ministry of the Interior?

946
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,720
He deleted all the information about the Jianmin plan

947
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,120
as if this never happened

948
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,760
Because this seems to be a very embarrassing thing

949
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,120
yes embarrassing thing

950
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,000
It's not a benefit

951
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
My plan is

952
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,880
So all the information about the Jianmin project

953
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,200
you are online now

954
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,920
as if this never happened

955
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,280
never happened

956
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,280
But what I'm saying is

957
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,800
Let's see from the data

958
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,600
90 years of information to see

959
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,640
we have strong doubts

960
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,760
This Solo tax deep insurance is quite substantial

961
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,260
You only need to earn more than 110,000 points every month

962
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Less than 120,000

963
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,100
You're probably in the 10% rich

964
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,400
The rich man we imagine is for you to check

965
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,760
In other words, your husband and wife are probably not too bad.

966
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,760
For example, workers

967
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,400
you don't want to be superior

968
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,060
It's probably up to that standard.

969
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,560
Then additionally we see

970
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,660
Less than 50,000 yuan

971
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,760
A bunch of people didn't reach 50,000 yuan

972
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,360
Nearly three quarters more than 72 points

973
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,860
The monthly salary is less than 50,000 yuan

974
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,460
In addition, we report

975
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,360
Comparing the data of the doctrine number with the tax declaration data

976
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,260
we have reason to believe

977
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,560
There are probably more than 1.6 million households

978
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,160
Probably the tax system has not grasped it at all

979
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,460
It's legal and illegal, it's fine if you don't declare it

980
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,460
the concept in this

981
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,060
not on the plan

982
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I feel like getting a confirmation

983
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Because the characteristic of this program is that

984
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
you don't have to apply

985
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I use the data

986
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Maybe the Ministry of the Interior didn't even think of saying

987
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
have this problem

988
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Because how he repays is to let you go to Hong Kong

989
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
This compensation is for his authenticity

990
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
he won't have this problem

991
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Because if you have no money, you really have no money.

992
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But Hua Xuedao said the subsidy object

993
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
may not be right

994
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Because the left and right fields are small

995
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
this guy is rich

996
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
he drives the car

997
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
You can probably tell that he lives in a house.

998
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
why he can get

999
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
i can't take it

1000
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So if you check the newspapers at that time

1001
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Many local councils have a consultation

1002
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
because it's going to spread

1003
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
This guy can take

1004
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I guess he's probably going to be gone.

1005
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
to distribute

1006
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Maybe the left and right fields are small

1007
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
say this can take

1008
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
why can't i get it

1009
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Even if it's a big problem

1010
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
But the whole old man

1011
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
i hope i mean

1012
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
There is a Matchity

1013
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
This Matchity means

1014
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Shou Luo Tax Division

1015
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
More imaginary Shouluo tax

1016
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
That's right

1017
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,880
Obviously there are a lot of designs in Taiwan's income

1018
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,600
did not grasp at all

1019
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,800
Like I said we can get hold of now

1020
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,400
Most everything has buckle corners and flat sheets

1021
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,520
Flat single with buckle angle

1022
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,640
In other words, if you're filing your taxes, you're underage.

1023
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,120
If you are required to file taxes

1024
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,280
All your information is meat

1025
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,920
All those things are produced and all of them are mastered

1026
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,080
what is that

1027
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,840
It's like your salary

1028
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,960
For example, the company sends you encouragement

1029
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,240
or what bank pays your interest

1030
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,440
Those are all SER parties

1031
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,680
The bank will pay you a salary

1032
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,760
when the interest

1033
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,280
He will take the initiative to notify

1034
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,960
the irs says

1035
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,920
How much interest do I give him?

1036
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,480
or when the company wants to pay dividends

1037
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,200
He will take the initiative to notify

1038
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,800
the irs says

1039
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,320
how much encouragement does this guy get

1040
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,400
This is all with SER Party

1041
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,280
Once there is a SER Party

1042
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,280
you probably won't be able to escape

1043
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,000
Because it is equal to the national tax unit

1044
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
fully grasped

1045
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,660
But now the problem is no Street Party

1046
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,860
Taiwan can't do it well

1047
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,460
Because of Taiwan when we were young

1048
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,200
Taiwan has a characteristic

1049
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,800
Middle-aged and old enterprises are particularly developed

1050
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,460
So I think the question

1051
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,700
It's not about the water

1052
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,160
because i think it's

1053
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,460
structural problems

1054
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,260
it has two structural problems

1055
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:21,960
like i said

1056
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,360
One problem, of course, is that our middle-aged and old enterprises

1057
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,000
It's us Tang Da

1058
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,260
These are all year round

1059
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:28,760
Live all year round

1060
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,120
i used to say

1061
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,620
I am a student

1062
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,120
He is the person expected at the beginning of the year

1063
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,720
he once told me

1064
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,920
It's really useless to catch them.

1065
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,620
useless

1066
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,620
He might just declare bankruptcy or something

1067
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,520
And here is a profile

1068
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,320
This data also tells us that

1069
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,020
this is really not easy

1070
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,820
Because the statistics of the United States

1071
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,460
He says it's not easy to be a solo business

1072
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,220
This is the so-called sale improvement

1073
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,120
It's like being your own boss.

1074
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,360
look

1075
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,960
His data is about 57%

1076
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
will be exposed

1077
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,700
In other words, for moviegoing friends

1078
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,700
not one from taiwan

1079
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,700
it's hard for you to grasp

1080
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,200
The United States has based on their data

1081
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,700
estimated

1082
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,200
It's like researching it

1083
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,700
About half of the income

1084
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,200
Like one hundred yuan, about fifty-seven

1085
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,700
you probably didn't get it

1086
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,200
so this is a

1087
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,700
tantamount to a real problem

1088
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,700
real problem

1089
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,300
You can't shoot that every day

1090
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,300
So everyone gives him every day

1091
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,300
praise him

1092
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,300
And the atmosphere is really a lot

1093
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,300
In fact, if you go out of Taiwan now

1094
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,300
everyone is doing business

1095
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,300
angry so much

1096
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,300
You can't make every family smaller

1097
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,300
some more famous

1098
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,300
For example, when I was young, didn’t I have Fuhang Soymilk?

1099
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,300
Fuhang soy milk is famous

1100
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,300
When I was young, this family was full of famous

1101
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,300
villain is good

1102
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,300
Of course he will give you the account

1103
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,300
he can see

1104
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,300
look , you sold so much

1105
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,300
You paid taxes so why so little

1106
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,300
he has reason

1107
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,300
but that is to say

1108
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,300
So he's like those too famous

1109
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,300
probably not so good

1110
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,300
Because the national tax is of course small

1111
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,300
Your business is very good

1112
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,300
outside of those

1113
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,300
Check each one for you

1114
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,840
So this is a problem, Taiwan comes out

1115
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,200
So if in the process of enterprise development

1116
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,640
For example, getting bigger and bigger, for example, look at

1117
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,960
There used to be a lot of grocery stores in Taiwan

1118
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,440
That tax may be difficult to control

1119
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,600
But when you become 711, it's different

1120
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,600
In the case of 711, the national tax unit will fully grasp

1121
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,640
Because in the case of 711, it unifies itself and needs to control it internally

1122
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,640
In terms of internal control, it must have a document so that false reports cannot be made

1123
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,640
Therefore, throughout the development process, if

1124
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,640
Change to 711 for grocery stores

1125
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,640
We know that this kind of tax will increase

1126
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,640
Because the grocery store is difficult to control, 711 probably controls the tax

1127
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,640
Taiwan has such a problem

1128
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,640
In addition, I think there is a problem that

1129
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,640
Taiwan is an open and small economy

1130
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,640
locks out easily

1131
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,640
All I talk about is that I don't know

1132
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,640
Can this be used as an indicator?

1133
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
For example, the United News Network has a reward

1134
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,400
Commonwealth Magazine joined an international consortium of investigative journalists in July 2003

1135
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,000
Aiming at the status of overseas offshore assets in the Dazhong area

1136
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,800
A six-month investigation

1137
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,620
According to this decrypted data

1138
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,200
Overseas offshore asset holders in the Dazhong area probably

1139
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,480
37000

1140
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,020
Accounted for 35% of all data

1141
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,040
Among them Taiwan

1142
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,060
about this many

1143
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,120
1.5 times that of Hong Kong

1144
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,140
China's 1.5

1145
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,680
The Union of Journalists

1146
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,240
Taiwanese use tax shelter computers far more than Hong Kong

1147
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:33,540
Repay here

1148
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,080
but maybe

1149
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,620
There are different

1150
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:37,640
an interpretation

1151
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,180
not as good as you can imagine

1152
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,220
Because many people in Taiwan do business outside

1153
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,320
I understand that many of them just set up an account overseas.

1154
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,640
this account

1155
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:49,920
so

1156
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,220
Taiwan to tax the rich

1157
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,020
not as easy as we imagined

1158
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,580
From the point of view of education

1159
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,140
talk about what you get

1160
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,280
very quickly

1161
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,460
From an efficiency point of view

1162
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,380
It should have been lower tax rate

1163
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,300
because you can imagine

1164
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,460
A piece of land is over there

1165
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:11,960
how do you give it the gram

1166
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,060
it's the land

1167
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,660
The tax should be higher

1168
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,180
on the other hand

1169
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,660
it equals in and out quickly

1170
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,020
you give it a little boost

1171
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,860
it just ran away

1172
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,180
tax loss

1173
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,020
Very serious

1174
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,000
such tax

1175
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,020
Tax rates should have been lower

1176
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,020
From the point of view of education

1177
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,880
Taiwan is an open economy again

1178
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,080
Then Taiwan has another problem

1179
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,920
That is to say, it does not have diplomatic relations with many countries.

1180
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,820
no diplomatic relations at all

1181
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,980
Sometimes we can pass an equal to

1182
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,320
an exchange of information

1183
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,480
information exchange

1184
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,940
For example, in the tax department

1185
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,780
exchange of information

1186
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,080
can be mastered

1187
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,280
For example, between you and the mainland

1188
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,480
pay an information exchange

1189
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,280
I know the money you make in mainland China

1190
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,620
You, a Taiwanese businessman, made money in mainland China

1191
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,980
I know how much money I make

1192
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,060
But Taiwan has a problem

1193
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,260
That is to say, it has no political relations with many countries.

1194
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,760
so at this point

1195
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,000
It's not so easy now

1196
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
have faced a difficulty

1197
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So it is not so easy for rich people in Taiwan

1198
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
then we have a discussion this afternoon

1199
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
It's Zhu Qingying's luck

1200
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
He's been in therapy for financial problems lately

1201
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
he's going to do a study

1202
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
what is this research

1203
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
That is to say, the top one percent

1204
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
For example, out of 100 people

1205
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
You are one of the highest version of people

1206
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
he earns

1207
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
that is

1208
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
How much of the 100 yuan is the top one percent of the income

1209
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
For example, earning materials is about 13 yuan

1210
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
In other words, among the 100 yuan

1211
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
It is equal to the 100 yuan of our whole society

1212
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
The top one percent is about 13 yuan

1213
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
For example, on the data

1214
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I don't know the details, he remembers

1215
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
But there is an interesting phenomenon

1216
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
let's draw

1217
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
2012 words

1218
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
because in 2008 words

1219
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
We know the financial tsunami

1220
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
During the financial tsunami, the top one percent

1221
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
you can draw

1222
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
So we know that when the financial tsunami

1223
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
there is a decision

1224
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
He originally said that among the 100 yuan

1225
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,200
up to 13 percent

1226
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,800
In that year, you may only earn 7 yuan or 8 yuan

1227
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,000
so

1228
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,300
In addition, we just made an interesting declaration

1229
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,900
In 2012, we are ashamed

1230
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,200
This proportion is also falling

1231
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,700
then let's find out

1232
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,600
What happened in 2012

1233
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:22,200
We know that happened to be the secretary of the treasury at the time

1234
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Who is that called?

1235
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,400
I've been going there also with the female treasury secretary

1236
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,300
Isn't he going to engrave the forehand tax?

1237
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,800
carve a forehand tax

1238
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
You see, that year also made his proportion drop.

1239
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
equal to

1240
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
That is to say, to boil the eyes in the mouth, I think it means to say

1241
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Taiwanese want to tax the rich

1242
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
not so easy

1243
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
they have a way

1244
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
there are ways

1245
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
It's like if you want to tax him

1246
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
he ran to show you

1247
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So instead of a feature dispute

1248
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
This is the responsibility of making money

1249
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
He should pay more tax

1250
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
From a business point of view

1251
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
It's not that easy to see

1252
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
So I think it's two structural

1253
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
kind of question

1254
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
The first is greed for small and medium-sized enterprises

1255
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Tedo

1256
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Everyone is their own boss

1257
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
did you notice

1258
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
your relatives and friends

1259
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
As long as it is a small and medium-sized enterprise

1260
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Generally speaking

1261
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
don't do too badly

1262
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
His life is probably more humorous than yours

1263
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
but when it comes to paying taxes

1264
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
You guarantee that he pays less tax than you

1265
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
compare your life to words

1266
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
for example

1267
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
his house is better than yours

1268
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
eat better than you

1269
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
anything is better than you

1270
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
But you have to actually ask him how much he pays in taxes

1271
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
look

1272
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
You pay the new leader

1273
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
have you ever thought about

1274
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I guess they are higher

1275
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
not high

1276
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
and much taller

1277
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So I think it's one of those in Taiwan

1278
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
tantamount to a structural problem

1279
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
the one we just talked about

1280
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
american words

1281
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
in fact internationally

1282
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
There are 100 of them

1283
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
57 run away

1284
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
So express this thing

1285
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Actually it is not easy to grow

1286
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,720
has its difficulty

1287
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,840
For example, unless you invest a lot of resources

1288
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,000
If you invest a lot of resources

1289
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,400
Say you receive a dollar

1290
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,360
You have to pay fifty cents to collect

1291
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,680
It's not worth it

1292
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,760
So there is a structural problem

1293
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,320
in other words

1294
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,440
There are many such series

1295
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,280
In addition, Taiwan is open to Qingjing

1296
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,520
Code is easy to flow out

1297
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,200
You have to tax some people

1298
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,280
won't make it easy for you

1299
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,800
so overall

1300
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,320
I think code tax

1301
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,920
It might not be as good as we imagined.

1302
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,920
This is my main message

1303
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,360
Code tax strictly speaking

1304
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:35,960
It is a

1305
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,640
In theory a nice tax system

1306
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,440
because it can be tailored to your individual situation

1307
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,840
Make a design for you to measure the customer tax

1308
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,280
But in practice

1309
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,800
I think at least in Taiwan

1310
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,400
Let's look at the data

1311
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,320
have a big problem

1312
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,640
It's quite different from what we imagined.

1313
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,000
i think this

1314
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,080
Not that it's a problem I don't work on

1315
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,200
it's a structural problem

1316
00:50:59,200 --> 00:50:59,960
structural

1317
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,600
If this is the case, we may have to think differently about the design of broken characters, and get out of the situation

1318
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:10,000
It cannot be said that we will only strengthen the reform of broken gloves.

1319
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,160
may have a different idea

1320
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,160
So the underlying idea is that we know how to break into pieces

1321
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,760
Probably a space that can be considered

1322
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,800
Let's take a look at this, of course everyone knows it

1323
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,360
That newspaper is very big

1324
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,120
That is to say, global housing prices are affordable

1325
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,280
Since Taipei City is higher than Hong Kong

1326
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,000
It is the house price glove ratio

1327
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,680
That is to say, the price of the gloves you earn is compared with your gloves

1328
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,200
also more than several times

1329
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,200
more than several times

1330
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,080
You see us ordinary people in London, Los Angeles

1331
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,080
These are famous cities anyway

1332
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,120
we are now taller than that

1333
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,360
It's really hard to imagine a thing

1334
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:59,400
In addition, if we know it, we will announce it now

1335
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Why announce land restrictions? Mainly the so-called land tax increase

1336
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
This has a notice of land restrictions

1337
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
It is the tax authority for landowners

1338
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
It is used as the basis for land value appreciation when the land is sold and sold

1339
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
it is tuned once a year

1340
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
now you can come and look for it

1341
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
fine

1342
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
That is to say, the tone is not as low as imagined.

1343
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
The announcement limit is equal to the announcement limit adjustment, which is close to the market price, about 80 or so

1344
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Like Taipei City to 89

1345
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
New Taipei City to 89

1346
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Anyway, other places are okay

1347
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
This is when we know that you buy and sell land

1348
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
There is a benchmark for the course

1349
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Curriculum Benchmarks

1350
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
but let's look at another

1351
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
what would you look like if you held land

1352
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
This gap is quite big

1353
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
What is the main purpose of announcing the land price?

1354
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Announcement of land ownership by all persons during the land holding period

1355
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,840
It has to pay a tax, which is the announced land price

1356
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:09,440
We just bought and sold land, you have to pay a land increase tax, land value-added tax

1357
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,640
But if you own land, for example, if you own a house, you probably own land

1358
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,360
For land, you have to pay a land value tax

1359
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,080
The land value tax is adjusted every three years

1360
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,760
In other words, only once every three years

1361
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,800
And you see, the gap between the market price and the market price is quite large, the gap between the market price is quite large

1362
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,800
In other words, if you own the house, especially the land

1363
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,800
The holding cost is not high, simply put

1364
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,800
If we discuss it with our colleagues, maybe you own a car

1365
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,800
You pay more taxes than you pay on owning a house

1366
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,800
In other words, what you pay every year is what you pay for your car

1367
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,800
Not a license plate tax, but also fuel fees

1368
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,800
Then the sum might be higher than the one you paid, even the tax you paid with a house

1369
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
is this really reasonable

1370
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
it's not very reasonable

1371
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Let's take a look at this picture and tell us that

1372
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,000
If we take three years and 100 years in 2000 as a machine

1373
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Check out this change

1374
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
This is an index of a new house

1375
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
That is three years and 120 years in 2000

1376
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
You can see the index words

1377
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
If the red is the index

1378
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Of course it has risen to about 270 now

1379
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
about 270

1380
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
But also with this 2000 three-year 100 units

1381
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
you use a land appreciation tax

1382
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Or underground tax house tax

1383
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
You see, it might be better to increase the tax on this land

1384
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Land tax increase should be this, but unpredictable

1385
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
About 160 170

1386
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
But this underground tax

1387
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
just to put it simply

1388
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
When we were young, the modernization rule increased the price and returned the goods

1389
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
It is obvious from this soil

1390
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
The price increase did not return the goods at all

1391
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,760
Because it's so long

1392
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,120
but the really broken parts

1393
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,840
It's quite a big difference from before.

1394
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,800
quite a big gap

1395
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,700
I just said it was

1396
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,400
Our government is violating the constitution

1397
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,900
tantamount to violating the constitution

1398
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,200
to grow back

1399
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,300
Tell you from this picture

1400
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,460
It didn't last long at all.

1401
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,560
big gap

1402
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,760
OK

1403
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,080
what we just said

1404
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,560
There is a problem with the lock

1405
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,000
Not as good as expected

1406
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,500
what to do

1407
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,500
My idea of ​​paying is to say

1408
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:38,000
Property tax should be a good tax object

1409
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,300
tax object

1410
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,860
think about it

1411
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,900
He escaped in the lock

1412
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,500
i didn't pay

1413
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:50,960
but he might go buy some real estate

1414
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,260
The real estate is right there

1415
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:55,760
Real estate is something you can see and touch.

1416
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,460
not the same as locked

1417
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,720
You have to think about how much this person has locked up

1418
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,920
it's hard for you to imagine

1419
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,200
We call Property Pharma Center's Property Declaration Pharmacy

1420
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,800
The rules may not be so accurate

1421
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,800
But property I think is pretty accurate

1422
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,000
Because any property you make is where

1423
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,200
it is very clear

1424
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,800
Moreover, our small Taiwan adopts a registration system

1425
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,800
That is, you probably wouldn't easily register in someone else's name, would you?

1426
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,400
Presumably your property is registered in your name

1427
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,000
That property is clearly over there

1428
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
over there

1429
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
So I think this should be taught to him

1430
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Equal to that you may be in the code so not paid

1431
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Now the property is over there

1432
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
And we call it property, what characteristics does it have?

1433
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
it's right there

1434
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
over there

1435
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
what your class rules say

1436
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
If it's a heavy lesson

1437
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
It's also a lesson

1438
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
or become more difficult to move

1439
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
But now the property is over there

1440
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
What is the characteristic of this in terms of taxation?

1441
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
This is distortion is relatively small this tax

1442
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
because it's right there

1443
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,820
it may of course have a sequela

1444
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,020
It's what you might think of after your class

1445
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,740
That means you step on the past to accumulate property again

1446
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,180
not so good

1447
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,300
have this sequelae

1448
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,780
But now it's over there

1449
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:12,900
over there

1450
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,500
It's worth the lesson

1451
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,300
well worth the lesson

1452
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,820
So this is equivalent to saying

1453
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:21,220
That is to say, the pieces of your hand didn’t reach that part

1454
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,580
your property is visible

1455
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:26,580
Is it possible to use the broken part of the property

1456
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,900
To make up for the lack of broken hands

1457
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:33,900
And it means that our small financial distribution is uneven now

1458
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,900
Uneven financial distribution

1459
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,900
So it might be a good idea to tax the wealth and people

1460
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,900
Another idea is to pay taxes

1461
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,900
small for tax

1462
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,900
Our small class method of course has two methods

1463
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,900
One is like America

1464
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,900
only in the last stage

1465
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,900
tax when you spend

1466
00:57:58,900 --> 00:57:59,900
just consume

1467
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
This is like Taiwan and the European Union

1468
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
we call it business value tax

1469
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
for each stage

1470
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
taxation of part of the value

1471
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
but we know your total value in the endgame

1472
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Is it the same value as yours?

1473
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
So it is generally believed that

1474
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
No matter you are in the United States, you are tracking

1475
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Sales Tax for Stage Courses

1476
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Or the so-called business value tax in the EU and Taiwan

1477
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Its main difference is that it is equal to

1478
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It's right to add a difference in means

1479
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
collect in one segment

1480
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
It's still the last stage to collect

1481
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
less than two basically

1482
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
You can think of it like it's a consumption tax

1483
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
sale tax

1484
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
sale tax

1485
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
It is generally considered a regressive tax

1486
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,000

1487
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
So it's generally considered a bad tax

1488
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
right

1489
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
it is a regressive tax

1490
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
but this point of view

1491
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I don't think that's right

1492
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
how to say

1493
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
point in time to observe

1494
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
is indeed

1495
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,560
This is a regressive tax. Why is it a regressive tax?

1496
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,960
Because those who kept higher

1497
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,960
Because if you consume it, you are done eating, right?

1498
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,760
finished eating

1499
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,840
like eating

1500
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,960
your stomach is that big

1501
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,400
you can't eat a lot

1502
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,400
There is probably a limit to how well you eat.

1503
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,360
For example, a rich person like Guo Taiming

1504
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,960
you eat well

1505
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,800
Anyway, his defense is dozens or hundreds of times better than mine

1506
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,200
But he probably only eats mine

1507
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,440
only my double or double

1508
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,640
he spent money

1509
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,160
Because this is a very real problem

1510
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:32,880
because you eat

1511
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,040
your stomach is that big

1512
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,680
So if we look at it from the perspective of a certain time period

1513
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,280
He is indeed a regressive

1514
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,600
Because of the consumption proportion of the master's starting hand

1515
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,040
is relatively low

1516
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,720
Excluding the specific gravity is relatively high

1517
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,800
Conversely, if you keep low

1518
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,880
Like when I compare with Guo Taiming

1519
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,840
His removal rate must be much higher than mine

1520
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:52,880
I'm relatively low handed

1521
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,560
When starting the consumption and removing the proportion

1522
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,600
will

1523
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,680
In other words, consumption is higher

1524
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,920
If I remove it, the proportion will be lower

1525
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,000
But since GST is a proportional tax

1526
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,760
Consumption tax is a tax on consumption

1527
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,960
There is no tax on the outgoing part

1528
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,560
Therefore, the proportion of consumption in the current income is relatively low

1529
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:12,800
He is a master

1530
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,840
Those who spend more than the current income will be lower-handed

1531
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,960
Taxes that pay a relatively large proportion of income

1532
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,800
In other words, Porteimon, for example

1533
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,040
He earns hundreds of millions each

1534
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,240
His consumption may be, for example, 10 million

1535
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,440
My income may be, say, 100,000

1536
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,400
I spend maybe 50,000

1537
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:35,640
Look at the proportion of the digger, he spends 10 million out of 100 million

1538
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,040
10 million is very high

1539
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,400
But compared to 100 million

1540
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,480
just one tenth

1541
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,280
But my words say 100,000

1542
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,560
When the spend reaches 60,000

1543
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,600
I'm six out of ten

1544
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,880
So the proportion of my payment is obviously higher than that of buying Taiwan doors

1545
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,600
So most people think this tax is a bad tax

1546
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,400
it is a view on regressive taxation

1547
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,400
but let's think about it

1548
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
People don't just live in a certain world, they live in a very long time

1549
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
It's hard to say if you don't care about the Middle Ages

1550
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,000
How should I put it? First, if you compare at a certain point in time

1551
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,000
When you start with a high score and a low score, it is probably related to your age

1552
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
For example, if you think about it, when you first entered the workplace, your salary must not be high

1553
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Conversely, when you retire, you have no salary at that time, so the lockup must be relatively low

1554
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Conversely, when you are in your fifties or sixties, your salary is at its peak

1555
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:40,000
So at that time, young people paid a higher proportion of consumption tax and consumption tax.

1556
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Or the consumption tax paid by the elderly is relatively high, and the tax paid by people in their fifties and sixties will be relatively low

1557
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
This is purely the number of years, purely the number of years

1558
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Because you are young and you will be fifty or sixty one day

1559
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Fifty or sixty years old will retire one day

1560
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
So this is the peak

1561
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,200
If you want to get up, be your own, so in other words

1562
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,560
A result of the different cycles of this life

1563
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,160
It's right to be a gap

1564
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,760
So at a certain point in time you watch this

1565
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,600
Observe with you from a person's life

1566
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,360
This is different, you see

1567
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,240
What will you do with the money you earn in your life

1568
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,560
what will happen to you you will eventually run out

1569
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,720
How should I put it, eat it and spend it if you want

1570
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,360
Either donate to your child

1571
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,560
or leave an inheritance to your children

1572
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,000
Just leave a legacy to donate this thing

1573
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,280
can be counted as an expense

1574
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,000
words with some form of consumption

1575
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,400
You just spend your money, right?

1576
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,560
you are in the middle of your life

1577
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,320
You're done eating again, right?

1578
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,240
But you might just pass the money on to your kids

1579
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,360
or bequeath to your children

1580
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,680
But it would be nice to leave that bequest

1581
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,760
Or change hands

1582
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,960
see it as some kind of

1583
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,600
Formal consumption, because a tax will be levied for a while

1584
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:07,160
you see it as a form of consumption

1585
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:12,040
I think it is more reasonable to say that this tax is basically a proportional tax

1586
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:15,620
Because the end of my middle hand is all spent?

1587
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,180
you see from a certain practice

1588
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:19,720
it is a tax refund

1589
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:24,840
If you look at it from the point of view of your life, what is the end of your life?

1590
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,140
spend it in some form

1591
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:30,720
Speaking of those forms, we all regard it as some kind of consumption

1592
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,780
We will give it a lesson on that consumption

1593
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,300
For example, consumption tax

1594
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,380
For example, if we talk about the tax for a while, we will impose a proportional tax of 10%.

1595
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,420
At least now than consumption tax

1596
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,760
The consumption tax rate is still high, because the consumption tax is now 5%

1597
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,800
Because it's 5%, now

1598
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,620
It’s been 10% for a while, it’s even higher than that

1599
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,920
So in a way

1600
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,020
From the point of view of life, maybe it is not a person

1601
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:55,300
not alone

1602
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,580
And in fact someone did a study

1603
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,360
It turns out that from a lifetime point of view

1604
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,600
Maybe from a certain experiment, for example, this year

1605
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:05,960
it's really different

1606
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,160
words from a lifelong point of view

1607
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,240
Its discovery is that

1608
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,800
in fact a billy tax

1609
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,440
and it even has a D

1610
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,280
even a bump

1611
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,400
I don't want you to be rough, right?

1612
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,600
it says even a little tired

1613
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:16,960
I don't know what's the reason for this tiredness

1614
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,040
But basically you can imagine

1615
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,200
From a lifetime perspective, this tax

1616
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,840
I think billy tax is more reasonable

1617
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,120
Billy tax is more reasonable

1618
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,080
In a certain experiment, the height of your hand is D

1619
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,240
For example, like when I was just now

1620
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,160
When you are middle-aged, of course you earn more money

1621
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:33,600
when you were young

1622
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,240
Of course, when you are old, you earn less money

1623
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,720
So from this point of view

1624
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,120
The tax you pay is higher

1625
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,240
So the tax will be lower

1626
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,680
Because you spend less

1627
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,240
more when you were young

1628
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,080
spend more money

1629
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,120
So the tax is heavier

1630
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,320
This is purely a matter of age

1631
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,120
words from a lifelong point of view

1632
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,320
i think it should be a billy tax

1633
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,040
This is what I want to emphasize

1634
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,000
may be

1635
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,200
Talk to us about consumption tax in general

1636
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,500
Generally the strongest objection is that

1637
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,100
it is a tax refund

1638
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,100
at least i don't think so

1639
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:11,100
I think it should be a more reasonable view

1640
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,300
from a lifelong perspective

1641
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,800
You keep it all your life and spend it all in the end

1642
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,700
And I will give you a certain percentage if I spend all of it

1643
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:19,100
it is a proportional tax

1644
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,100
if so

1645
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,800
Then there is another view as we said earlier

1646
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,000
That is to say, there are probably many of us

1647
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:31,900
probably all

1648
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,200
That is, many of the taxes paid are payroll taxes.

1649
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,000
salary

1650
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,200
So here we have a profile

1651
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,000
have a profile

1652
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
That is to say, with the past two years

1653
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,900
Two years of tax returns

1654
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,800
The salary is about

1655
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,000
On our tax return it's about 75%

1656
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,700
That is to say, in our tax filing

1657
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:51,700
belonging to the payroll

1658
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,500
Based on the data of the past two years

1659
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:54,400
on average

1660
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,000
average about

1661
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,400
This should be a photo

1662
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,300
Hundreds of billions

1663
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,400
More than three trillion, that's probably, the mental part,

1664
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,200
In other words, about 15% of the mind part of our New Year's materials

1665
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,800
The non-mental part is about one trillion,

1666
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,600
In other words, the three trillion and one trillion account for about 25%

1667
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,200
If we compare this information with the United States,

1668
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,000
Compared with other European countries,

1669
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,400
How about it? In the United States, if we also use the data of the past two years to look at it,

1670
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,800
The ratio of its mind to movement is about 56.3,

1671
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,800
In other words, less than 60%

1672
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:29,800
About 43% after non-psychological ratio

1673
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:35,000
If we look at the OECD countries in Europe,

1674
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,800
Using the data of the past two years for comparison,

1675
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,800
It's even lower than this,

1676
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:43,600
less than, in other words, half and half,

1677
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,400
In other words, on the information about the age,

1678
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,800
data presented in other countries,

1679
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,000
My thoughts are not so high,

1680
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,400
However, the ratio shown in our Taiwan data is quite high,

1681
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,400
about 75%,

1682
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,400
If you compare it with the United States,

1683
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,000
Can you see it or not?

1684
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,720
For example, if you think of it as sixty-four

1685
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,520
This is about half and half

1686
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,920
But Taiwan's words seventy-five-eight

1687
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,800
what is this manifestation

1688
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,600
means that part of our non-new place

1689
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,400
probably a lot

1690
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,600
Probably didn't get it

1691
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,720
Then what is a primary idea

1692
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,600
The primary idea is that we know

1693
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,200
what you earn is your income

1694
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,160
Another time you will spend

1695
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,920
This is your consumer side

1696
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,200
I just said the words spent

1697
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,000
you think of it as a generalized flower

1698
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,920
For example, the inheritance you leave to your children

1699
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,720
You end up spending it too

1700
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:45,120
Here we have an income tax

1701
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,000
Here we have an excise tax or business value tax

1702
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:49,960
in other words

1703
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:52,080
Income side of your income

1704
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,400
I carve an income tax

1705
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,880
on the side of where you get paid

1706
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,600
I engrave a GST

1707
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,040
Taiwan called business value tax

1708
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,640
If we don't have a good grasp of this aspect of keeping

1709
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,920
From the data point of view, it is not well grasped

1710
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,720
Can we start from the side of consumption

1711
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,000
cover him partly

1712
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,560
And this side feels like Shinnomori's stand is busy and high

1713
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,920
So this guard is probably as you can imagine

1714
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,800
Mostly you can think of him as a new tax guard

1715
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:33,240
Therefore, there may be a gap in Taiwan's tax compliance.

1716
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,760
He still has 25% he is not a non-new guard

1717
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:39,840
Roughly you can imagine that it mainly comes from Shinnoshu

1718
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,240
But on the other hand, consumption tax

1719
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,920
So a basic idea is to say

1720
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,240
You missed the tax on this side

1721
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,160
But when you spend you still spend

1722
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,560
So guarding this missing part I didn't engrave it

1723
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,240
can i spend time from you

1724
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,400
I cover you back

1725
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,300
because you're guarding this side now

1726
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:04,500
Basically this new information guards the tax

1727
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,900
There are a lot of guards missing

1728
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:09,100
That is to say, there are structural problems

1729
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:11,200
There are so many holes in the chamber

1730
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,800
open economy again

1731
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,400
so your class that tax is a bit difficult

1732
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,400
But you still have to spend it if you want to eat it hot

1733
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,300
so spend this part

1734
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,800
This aspect is equal to your taxes, for example,

1735
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,000
If you have raised it here, for example, within 1,000 yuan

1736
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
You only go up to say 700 yuan

1737
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,300
You missed 300 yuan

1738
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,600
But it still has to spend out of the 1000

1739
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,600
here when it's spent

1740
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,000
can i raise it back

1741
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,300
and it feels like

1742
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,400
Here you have raised to 7000 yuan

1743
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,600
but on this side

1744
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,900
you may be 1000 yuan

1745
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,800
your tax is bigger

1746
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,100
So the basic idea is to say

1747
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:49,300
can i get it back from the other side

1748
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:51,100
get it back like this

1749
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,500
This is probably my most basic idea

1750
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,200
the idea

1751
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:58,300
you look first

1752
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,500
As long as the so-called tax is the new tax

1753
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,600
If your salary is taxable, if your salary is taxable

1754
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:10,300
What is the gap between you and your sales tax?

1755
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:15,700
The difference is that if you have accumulated financial resources now,

1756
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,420
If you accumulate finances, for example, if you have several houses,

1757
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,940
Keeping the tax is not a lesson to us,

1758
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,740
Because it's basically a payroll tax,

1759
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:30,840
In other words, if we determine that Taiwan's Shou De tax,

1760
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,240
Basically, if a new capital keeps tax,

1761
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:40,240
Your wealth need not be taxed,

1762
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:45,040
You don't have to keep the tax, it's right, you can't pay the tax, it's right,

1763
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:51,740
But if you turn it into sales tax, I can get it,

1764
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,240
Why can I attend class?

1765
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:59,240
Because sooner or later all your life will be spent,

1766
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,500
So we will also send out in this house

1767
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:04,860
How to send it away?

1768
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:09,840
He might just sell it or leave it to his son

1769
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,460
but anyway

1770
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:15,040
For those corners, we consider him to be a kind of consumption

1771
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,300
From the consumption fee, we can still keep it from flying

1772
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:22,800
So this is payroll tax versus excise tax

1773
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,660
I think one of the biggest differences

1774
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:29,840
In other words, if you use the payroll tax

1775
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,760
In other words, what tax do you pay?

1776
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,460
You have to pay taxes when you work at a young age

1777
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,160
wait till old age

1778
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,000
You don’t have to pay for every few accounts

1779
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:39,760
because hand tax

1780
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,860
Pay as we just said

1781
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,160
It's basically a payroll tax

1782
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,660
you were making money when you were young

1783
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,460
You have to pay this tax on the money you earn

1784
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:51,160
But you don't have to pay every few financial

1785
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,460
On the contrary, if you pay consumption tax

1786
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:56,660
what kind of personality does it have

1787
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:57,800
Because consumption tax means

1788
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,120
You have to pay for what you consume

1789
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,560
If I just imagine

1790
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,860
Say you leave a house for your son

1791
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:08,800
It's also a form of consumption

1792
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,100
That consumption tax can be taught

1793
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:17,000
But the tax of the workshop is not covered

1794
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,200
And here I have quoted this article

1795
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,600
he has an opinion

1796
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,900
It is said that wealth is not equal to the wealth of a society

1797
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:31,200
uneven words

1798
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,100
Consumption tax is better than lock tax

1799
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,100
Why? Because wealth is uneven

1800
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:38,700
Your locked tax payment is basically a new lock tax

1801
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:43,300
Wealth is tantamount to being useless

1802
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:44,800
unless you like what we said earlier

1803
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,000
can a property tax

1804
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,700
Property tax is of course more direct

1805
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,600
But if the property tax cannot be paid

1806
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,100
Consumption tax is tantamount to indirect eight-and-a-half guide

1807
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:56,300
because when you want to consume

1808
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:59,700
For example, you may sell your house to make a consumption

1809
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,620
bequeath that house to your son

1810
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,620
If we regard all these as a consumption

1811
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:11,280
And we do make these things on the tax system

1812
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,780
We all have words for it

1813
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:18,060
Excise taxes are actually better improvements than locked-in taxes

1814
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,780
Lock separation Financial separation

1815
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,360
because of the wealth of those ages

1816
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,440
You can't pay the tax for the new lock

1817
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,800
Because you only get this tax when you are in the new lock

1818
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,440
But consumption tax can be imposed

1819
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,080
Why?

1820
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,120
because of your finances

1821
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,720
In the end it will be spent in some form

1822
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,160
Like leaving an inheritance to your son

1823
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,320
or will spend in some form

1824
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,480
once spent

1825
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,560
If we interpret it as an expense in a relatively broad sense

1826
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,000
Consumption tax can be taxed to this tax

1827
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:50,400
class to this tax

1828
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,440
and he thinks

1829
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,560
If a society's finances are uneven

1830
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,040
GST is a better tax

1831
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,160
right

1832
01:13:58,960 --> 01:13:59,960
because of the financial part

1833
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,760
Sales tax is available

1834
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:02,960
Where's your tax?

1835
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:03,960
If it is a salary hand tax

1836
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,160
If it belongs to the tax nature of salary hand

1837
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,160
Less than this class

1838
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,440
So my idea is to say

1839
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,960
we are small now

1840
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,280
If we are now in Taiwan

1841
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,040
In Taiwan, it is business

1842
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,080
Business value is now 5%

1843
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,160
5%

1844
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,680
Then my idea is to say

1845
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:31,680
Because my property tax is used to make up for the lack of helper's tax

1846
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,680
Because the property is there

1847
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,680
This person has accumulated

1848
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,680
After the accumulation is over, it is like the land

1849
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:38,680
right there

1850
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,680
over there words

1851
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:40,680
if you pay taxes again

1852
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:41,680
From the point of view of education

1853
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,680
no efficiency loss

1854
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,680
because he has accumulated

1855
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,680
before you accumulate

1856
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:48,680
he will affect that is to say

1857
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,680
Do I want to accumulate

1858
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:50,680
For example, you now announce that

1859
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:51,680
I am now for his property

1860
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:52,680
I have to pay heavier taxes

1861
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,680
what will he affect

1862
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:55,680
Affect those who have not yet accumulated

1863
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:56,680
or those who want to accumulate

1864
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:58,680
for those who have accumulated

1865
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,680
he was not

1866
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
fully manageable

1867
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,000
Because once the government announces

1868
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,600
For example, for each household, I now add it to the moderator of the middle school

1869
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,840
it has a phenomenon

1870
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,800
This is what we call capitalization

1871
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,720
What is capitalization?

1872
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,440
What is the value of your house

1873
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,680
The value of a house is

1874
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,360
You can generate income in the future

1875
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:23,040
This income includes the income you live in

1876
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,520
Also includes the proceeds that you can rent out

1877
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:27,720
This is what this house is worth

1878
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:28,960
you live alone

1879
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,960
Or you can rent it out to someone else

1880
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,120
you can collect this income

1881
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,680
Think about it, once the government collects taxes

1882
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:36,960
what does it mean

1883
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,440
means, for example, that every month you

1884
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,680
Originally, the rent could have been, say, 20,000 yuan.

1885
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,800
I can take a class now

1886
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,360
It's like a little bit of 20,000 yuan

1887
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,600
The government took 5,000 yuan

1888
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:49,640
what is this wish

1889
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,960
You could have rented your house at 20,000 yuan a month

1890
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,600
Once the government announces that

1891
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:58,400
Out of the 20,000, I can collect 5,000.

1892
01:15:58,960 --> 01:15:59,960
including real estate

1893
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,160
It means that the value of each root of your house is only 15,000

1894
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:07,400
15,000 for each 15,000 if you fly it back

1895
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,400
The value of this section of the house will drop immediately

1896
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,200
we fall

1897
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,800
This is the capitalization of our education

1898
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:15,600
capitalization

1899
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:19,800
So this poor means

1900
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:25,800
ok

1901
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:30,800
what we say

1902
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,200
that is

1903
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,400
right now

1904
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,800
That is to say, directly tax the finances

1905
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,600
Of course it is a better way

1906
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,600
but if not

1907
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,000
we can retire as a planner

1908
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,600
Make a correction from the consumption tax

1909
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,400
Of course our current consumption tax rate is 5%

1910
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,800
The tax rate of hand tax is of course much higher

1911
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:52,600
so how to correct

1912
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,200
One of my thoughts is to say

1913
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:57,000
Is it possible to treat all consumer goods as

1914
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:57,600
Two-level cargo industry

1915
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,600
one is normal

1916
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,600
One is a high-end product like this

1917
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,400
Let's give it five boards for the blue bottle

1918
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,400
For high-end bottles, we will give them a relatively high breakage rate, and the board will be ten.

1919
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,600
At present, we want to talk about the provisions of the business tax law

1920
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,900
The applicable tax rate for the business tax rate is the lowest board, the board with the highest five boards

1921
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:12,400
There is administrative luck in this tax increase

1922
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,800
In case you want to mention board five, just prove

1923
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,600
I declared to myself that if I want class five, I don’t have to go through the Legislative Yuan.

1924
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,900
What I'm breaking down here is to say

1925
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:24,700
Is it possible to divide our consumer products into two categories

1926
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:28,300
One is more commonly used

1927
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,500
One is a relatively high-end bottle

1928
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,600
One is a relatively high-end bottle

1929
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,200
Can be divided into two categories

1930
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:38,700
So the basic idea is something like

1931
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:43,200
Is it necessary to expand the current facility tax to a relatively large extent?

1932
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,100
This is probably the most basic idea

1933
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:48,900
So the overall source

1934
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:52,800
I'd say it's probably the first

1935
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,800
It is very problematic on the tax of the hand

1936
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,900
Not as good as we thought

1937
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:00,100
from the tax system

1938
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,460
Let's see, from the competition plan

1939
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:05,920
Feeling, of course, is full of problems

1940
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,460
So since there is a problem

1941
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:11,260
So in terms of the design of Suizhi

1942
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:13,300
We're going to have a whole new, different idea

1943
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:16,460
And the question I think

1944
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:18,460
It's not that any one person can solve the problem

1945
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:21,460
it's a structural problem

1946
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:23,460
Because there are so many Chinese series in Taiwan

1947
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:24,960
those people are amazing

1948
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,960
You have to tax some people in Taiwan

1949
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:27,960
not so easy

1950
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:29,960
it's a structural problem

1951
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,960
It's not that the government doesn't work hard

1952
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,960
effort or not

1953
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:34,960
like the words in the American data

1954
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:35,960
Sale Importment

1955
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,960
It ran away with 57 out of 100

1956
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,960
America should be a very advanced country

1957
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,960
Although it is the whole world to find

1958
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,960
You are a U.S. citizen in Taiwan

1959
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:44,960
you have to pay taxes

1960
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:45,960
it's pretty awesome

1961
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,960
Look at the 100 yuan

1962
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,960
57 yuan escaped

1963
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,960
It means that this matter is not so easy to solve

1964
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,960
Taiwan is another open economy

1965
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,960
in the words of master

1966
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:57,960
flow fast

1967
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,760
Those who are very high should have a lower tax rate

1968
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:04,200
From the point of view of education

1969
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,960
From the point of view of efficiency, it should be low and should not be high

1970
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,760
It's not so easy when you tax him

1971
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:14,560
So the tax at hand, judging from the data, is there any problem

1972
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,600
From a structural point of view, it is not so easy to correct him.

1973
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,160
So for an idea that arises is to say

1974
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,000
Taiwan's tax structure may have a very different idea

1975
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,400
Can not follow our general academic qualifications

1976
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,400
That is, the idea you read in the textbook

1977
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,640
to design the tax system

1978
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,320
rather than a fair dispute

1979
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,240
How about I have to tax the masters heavily?

1980
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,800
But maybe when actually executing

1981
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,680
have a big problem

1982
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,560
I'm just saying today

1983
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,760
Is it possible to look at it from two perspectives

1984
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:44,720
from property tax

1985
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,600
It's certainly a nice tax system

1986
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,280
he has accumulated over there

1987
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,600
And wealth inequality is a problem for workers in Greater Asia

1988
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,720
If you tax him the stuff accumulated over there

1989
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,360
no efficiency loss

1990
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,120
His loss of efficiency is

1991
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,240
those of the future who are ready to accumulate

1992
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,160
Because he thought of the tax in the class

1993
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,720
I don't want to accumulate

1994
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:07,680
I accumulate less

1995
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,840
will affect

1996
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,520
but for the accumulated

1997
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,560
In other words, how many houses do you have now those people

1998
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,120
There is actually nothing to lose

1999
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,640
like a piece of land

2000
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:18,440
you put there first

2001
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,200
I give you lessons

2002
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,080
No matter how high the tax is, you have nothing to do

2003
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,960
It's not like saying you're a master of taxation

2004
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,440
He moves the finances out

2005
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,800
He removes all that he gets

2006
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,400
This will affect the behavior

2007
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,760
you accumulate over there first

2008
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,920
I will tax you even higher

2009
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,440
It won't affect your behavior

2010
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,120
it's a property tax

2011
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:39,360
another excise tax

2012
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,800
consumption tax

2013
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,960
He should not be a tax burden

2014
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,360
From a lifelong perspective

2015
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,400
you make a definition of consumption

2016
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,920
to give a broad explanation

2017
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,480
I think it's more reasonable

2018
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,360
because he should be a tax

2019
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:53,600
than tax

2020
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,040
while consumption tax

2021
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:58,800
Compared with the tax compliance based on the new capital tax compliance

2022
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,000
he has an advantage

2023
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,080
It's your annual financial part.

2024
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,640
He can't pay tax on salary

2025
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,920
GST can be paid by him

2026
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:12,040
Because sooner or later those finances of yours are going to be spent in some form

2027
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:14,440
Once spent, he has some form of consumption

2028
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,000
once a form of consumption

2029
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,160
Consumption tax has a way to tax this tax

2030
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:22,840
For a country, as long as the financial distribution becomes more unequal,

2031
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:26,560
Excise tax is actually better than hand tax

2032
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:31,160
But consumption tax we know that the current tax rate is 5% which is low

2033
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,160
You're going to replace the tax on hands with the GST

2034
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,920
I don't think it's that easy

2035
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,800
So a possible solution

2036
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:41,480
I think it is possible to divide our consumption into two commodities

2037
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:44,800
One is probably more normal

2038
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,280
One is more advanced

2039
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,160
We give it two tax rates

2040
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,760
Of course, there are many problems in practice and operation.

2041
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:52,920
For example, if you do this

2042
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,000
Do many people buy through online shopping?

2043
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,720
or export to buy

2044
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,320
Of course, there are very real issues to consider.

2045
01:21:59,320 --> 01:21:59,920
very real problem

2046
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
It's the opposite of paying

2047
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
OK, I'll probably stop here today

2048
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
we have a little time now to ask questions

2049
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
bring it up with me please cut it short

2050
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Thank you teacher for your wonderful speech

2051
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
What I want to ask is also for the two very brilliant ideas you just mentioned

2052
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
First property tax

2053
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Taiwan has the mutual characteristics of small and medium-sized enterprises

2054
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
The small and medium-sized enterprises serve each other and provide labor services to each other.

2055
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
We can't grasp his little sorrow

2056
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
On the other hand, you just mentioned

2057
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Accumulating wealth is ugly for a person's life

2058
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Should be a good tax system too

2059
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
But if I am the host of a small and medium-sized enterprise

2060
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I've been accumulating my fortune in my own business

2061
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I don't want to accumulate on me

2062
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I let my family continue to run the business

2063
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
The property has always been enjoyed by the family

2064
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
For this part, since he let the legal person accumulate the property

2065
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
He has no other property of his own

2066
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,200
to enjoy consumption

2067
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:04,500
Seems to be uncommon to the property tax

2068
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,500
Or the appearance of the consumption room

2069
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:07,400
I maybe you think

2070
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,000
no matter what

2071
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,800
Ask the teacher to tell you your information

2072
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,000
this detail may

2073
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,800
I can't say much

2074
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:14,500
This is equivalent to

2075
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:18,800
equal to a question on the executive side

2076
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,000
but what you just said

2077
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,300
I guess we should have rules

2078
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:22,700
You said what you said should be

2079
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,500
Similar to the concept of retaining the cloud forest

2080
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,500
like the money he made

2081
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,000
He continued to accumulate in the company

2082
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
then my understanding

2083
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Taiwan seems to have regulations on the preservation of Yunlin

2084
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
There is a rule that says

2085
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
For example, if you accumulate to a certain extent

2086
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,500
he's going to pay a tax or something

2087
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,300
is that he should have one

2088
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:40,200
tantamount to having a

2089
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,400
There should be a relevant provision in this tax law

2090
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,500
it's impossible to say

2091
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,700
Then you say to keep all the money in the company

2092
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:46,900
continue

2093
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:48,700
I understand this should

2094
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,600
should mean

2095
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,200
There are relevant provisions in the law

2096
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,900
That probably belongs to Reserve Yunlin

2097
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:56,100
he may force you to assign

2098
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:56,600
or how

2099
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:58,000
or if you keep Yunlin too much

2100
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,500
he might be able to take a class

2101
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
There's a retainer and there's a hundred-day tax

2102
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
hundred days tax

2103
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,500
So the previous industry you mentioned in the China region

2104
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,000
how are each other

2105
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
I'm not so clear about this

2106
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,500
But he only needs to consume

2107
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,000
If he just goes shopping

2108
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
if you buy something

2109
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
He pays that tax

2110
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Didn't he say for example

2111
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
previous hotel

2112
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
just post what

2113
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,500
He has to pay that tax, doesn't he?

2114
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,000
that's a question of performance

2115
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
You just

2116
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
just consume

2117
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
just consume

2118
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
just like us

2119
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,500
As long as you spend, you have to pay that tax

2120
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:31,500
i guess your question

2121
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:32,500
should

2122
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,500
I have a hunch that it should be fine.

2123
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:35,500
should be fine

2124
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,500
but maybe some

2125
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,500
That is to say I just came up with an idea

2126
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,500
My basic idea is to say

2127
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,500
first flick tax

2128
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,500
Maybe not as good as expected

2129
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,500
not as good as expected

2130
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,500
Since it is not as good as imagined

2131
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:47,500
what is the reason

2132
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,500
I feel like a

2133
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,500
structural problems

2134
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,500
not that you try to

2135
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,500
What is he trying to change

2136
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,500
I don't think it's

2137
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,500
not this question

2138
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,500
In this case

2139
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,500
I pay alone

2140
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,880
Maybe considering Taiwan's broken intelligence design

2141
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:07,000
call a new and different idea

2142
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I just said not long ago

2143
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
We have a colleague who said this

2144
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
he said in japan there is a debris room

2145
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
i don't know what their name is

2146
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
debris room

2147
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
his idea is to say

2148
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Each debris room, for example

2149
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Responsible for 100 SMEs

2150
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,000
For example, it would be right to only manage 100 companies.

2151
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
if you can imagine

2152
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
I'm in charge of the debris room

2153
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,000
For example, if there are 100 companies, I will be in charge.

2154
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Maybe you can draw some bonuses

2155
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
For example, I found

2156
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
how old should you be

2157
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
In the end you didn't speak

2158
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
I can draw some bonuses

2159
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
inject strength

2160
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
i really want

2161
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Can't do well in Taiwan

2162
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
For example, when we were young, we were so rich and strong

2163
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
that family is too famous

2164
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
i won't talk to my wife

2165
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I'll just drive there

2166
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Fu Hang Dou Jiang

2167
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
long time no go

2168
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,800
I want to say, of course you can, line up for people to come.

2169
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:06,000
Hehehe, let me tell him, forget it

2170
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,400
So that's so famous, so famous

2171
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:12,600
Think about it, maybe we can provide it

2172
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:16,600
That is, which one do you think can make a lot of money?

2173
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,600
Maybe you check everyone

2174
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:23,100
Everyone is going to be a baking cup

2175
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,400
go look it up go look it up he said

2176
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,800
If you find out, for example, you can get a commission before the lecture

2177
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,400
For example, I don't know when I was a child

2178
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,400
Will it? There may be a problem with this, that is,

2179
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:36,000
Will there be any missing complaints? Into the insult experiment

2180
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,200
He just gives it to you, to you, to you, which is a bit of a mess

2181
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,800
Then, for example, your family, I will

2182
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,300
Anyway, seeing that you are very upset, I will report it to you.

2183
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,000
I said this family has tax evasion.

2184
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,500
This has a related problem

2185
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:52,100
But in terms of self-service design, it means

2186
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:54,400
For example, say something like this, for example, let

2187
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,900
Everyone knows that, for example, there are a few that are not bad.

2188
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:00,000
This information can probably be grasped by adopting the purpose

2189
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,800
He can, because the Ministry of Finance is in the office, and he doesn't know

2190
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:08,360
For example, if you compare several companies to make more money, the locals are probably small.

2191
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:14,160
I mean maybe some, either the basic idea or the

2192
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:19,520
That is to say, a problem like this may require a very different idea to solve it

2193
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:23,240
Not like the traditional thinking, the traditional thinking

2194
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,240
Because this problem I think is a structural problem

2195
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,240
It's not a matter of working hard or not

2196
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:32,440
Like the American words I just said, one hundred yuan, fifty-seven yuan escaped

2197
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:34,440
Like the US, it should be very strict.

2198
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:43,440
So my basic idea is that maybe what I just mentioned is just a possible direction

2199
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,440
But maybe if you think about it, maybe it means

2200
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:49,440
It means that you can put forward different ideas and different views

2201
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:56,440
There is a common saying in Taiwan

2202
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:58,440
So long live Taiwan

2203
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,840
So I ask Professor Yang to address this issue

2204
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,640
your opinion

2205
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:10,840
Is it true that there are many inappropriate taxes in Taiwan?

2206
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,840
Otherwise, why is it called Taiwan Ten Thousand Tax?

2207
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,840
I don't think so

2208
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:17,240
However, from the tax perspective

2209
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,240
Taiwan tax is very low

2210
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:21,240
you were just the first in front of us

2211
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:24,240
From the point of view of tax ratio, the previous

2212
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,600
Suppose that in your capital

2213
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,600
Suppose you didn't do it last time

2214
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,600
with Ossie

2215
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,600
If you look at the single sale, it can reach forty

2216
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,600
Swedish words are more than fifty

2217
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,600
more than fifty

2218
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:37,600
In other words, out of a hundred dollars

2219
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,600
Only high taxes are taken away

2220
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,600
but that is to say

2221
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,600
Maybe I now people want to have one

2222
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,600
It's like he thinks it's good

2223
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:48,600
feel good

2224
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,600
The silver merchants are also probably their service is also very good

2225
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,600
I'm talking about the tax value

2226
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,600
Or everyone has a consensus like this

2227
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,600
But Taiwan's biggest problem now is that

2228
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:59,600
If you want to pay him more taxes

2229
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
not easy

2230
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:07,000
He will also first say that you show your efficiency

2231
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I remember when Chen Shui-bian first came up

2232
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
It wasn't that there was a Chen Dinglang

2233
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
he had an idea

2234
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,000
He said I must be very inefficient

2235
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
very inefficient

2236
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
He can save a lot if he comes up

2237
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
But he came up and didn't solve anything

2238
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
So that problem is not equal to the fuselage alone

2239
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
also makes sense

2240
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
If you take money from others

2241
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Of course I want to see your performance

2242
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Now our little one pays

2243
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
so we don't know where to go

2244
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
so i think another idea

2245
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
It may be to try to introduce a market economy

2246
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
not necessarily

2247
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
For example, to prove that all the services I provide can be sold

2248
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
don't say free price

2249
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
If you sell it, you probably have one to shop around for.

2250
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
don't buy you

2251
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
isn't he now

2252
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
now is forcing you to come

2253
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
So maybe the people have to spend their money

2254
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
i understand that is to say

2255
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Although the tax is very low

2256
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
but what we just said

2257
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Maybe not as low as I thought

2258
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Maybe it's all the burden of the new place

2259
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
but anyway

2260
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
many people's thoughts

2261
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I only know what a lot of people think

2262
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
that is

2263
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Your government is just not efficient so not so high

2264
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
not that high

2265
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
how tall is it

2266
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
we don't know

2267
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
The efficiency of the government is of course relatively poor

2268
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
probably can imagine

2269
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Because it has more regulations

2270
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
But the idea is to say

2271
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
When you want to take money from its pocket

2272
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I think the general public's thinking is that

2273
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Maybe this person takes money

2274
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
will still be wasted

2275
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
It's like not much help

2276
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
as far as we know

2277
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
seems to be the same product

2278
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
more than once engraved water

2279
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
engraved many times

2280
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
just say it many times

2281
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
This is the business value tax

2282
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,400
like me

2283
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,400
He would have taken more classes

2284
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,400
that should

2285
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,400
he is taxing part of your worth

2286
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:10,900
I don't give you a lot of supplements

2287
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:11,900
No la

2288
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:12,400
No la

2289
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,900
If he wants to come down and talk to the course

2290
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:14,900
he will make up

2291
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:15,900
but he is divided

2292
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,900
Partial class equal to this value

2293
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:18,900
But overall far away

2294
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,900
His tax rate is actually not high

2295
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:22,900
And the size of the government is not high

2296
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,900
compared with advanced countries

2297
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:25,900
And not only not high

2298
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:27,900
and gradually falling

2299
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,900
so

2300
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,900
It's a special phenomenon

2301
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:32,900
in other words

2302
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:34,900
The size of his government is compared with that of many countries

2303
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,900
are very low

2304
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:38,900
The tax I pay is compared with many countries

2305
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:40,900
are very low

2306
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:42,900
Not as high as imagined

2307
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:44,900
no double taxation

2308
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:45,900
Eh

2309
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:46,900
I don't know what you mean by double taxation

2310
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:47,900
but

2311
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:48,900
Maybe not as high as I thought

2312
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:49,900
Thanks

2313
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:50,900
Thanks

2314
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:51,900
come who

2315
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,900
last introduction

2316
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:55,900
Hello Mr. Yang

2317
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:56,900
that is

2318
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:58,900
Just now Teacher Yang mentioned that

2319
01:31:58,900 --> 01:31:59,900
he

2320
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,040
It's the one in Taiwan

2321
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,540
The gap between rich and poor has widened

2322
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:10,140
If the portion of income tax that is being reduced today

2323
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:14,700
If the income is levied in the form of consumption tax

2324
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:20,000
Will it lead to a wider gap between the rich and the poor?

2325
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,260
Thank you, teacher

2326
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:26,540
I just said that I am not advocating a consumption tax instead of an income tax

2327
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:28,900
i made no such claim

2328
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:31,360
Because the consumption tax is only 5% now

2329
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,500
Income tax is to let us know

2330
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,700
Some 40% and some 30% have

2331
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:39,560
So to replace it, I think this should not be feasible

2332
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:43,400
And this is far from the traditional concept

2333
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:46,360
Because the conventional wisdom is that an income tax is a better tax

2334
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:49,360
Consumption tax is a US tax

2335
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:52,400
I just want to give you an impression that

2336
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:55,700
Income tax is not as good as we thought

2337
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:57,560
From the data point of view

2338
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:59,620
In terms of progress

2339
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:00,120
indeed there are

2340
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:00,960
have a lot of questions

2341
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,580
The temperature elimination tax may not be as bad as we thought

2342
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,360
it is not a regressive tax

2343
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:11,520
My reasonable thought is that it should be a proportional tax

2344
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:12,720
proportional tax

2345
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:17,600
Is it possible to indirectly make up for the shortage of hand tax with the consumption tax

2346
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,080
it's just an idea

2347
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,480
But the fundamental idea is to say

2348
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,640
Negotiating the tax of hands is not as good as expected

2349
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:29,040
So in fact the tax potential

2350
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,480
may have a whole new and different idea

2351
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,480
new and different ideas

2352
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,160
we know that health insurance costs

2353
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,800
it receives a lot of tax

2354
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:40,120
a lot of taxes

2355
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,440
We know what we thought

2356
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:43,200
The original idea was to say

2357
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,480
We know that the combined filing

2358
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:45,200
Right

2359
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,720
The original idea was when it was first proposed

2360
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,240
The director at that time was Yang Shiliang

2361
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:51,680
He argued that the total declaration

2362
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:52,800
sum declaration

2363
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:54,960
sum declaration I felt that I was

2364
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:56,840
Not a big war like this

2365
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:59,840
This so-called tax itself has a large share

2366
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,360
You are putting the responsibility of the new master, who has already paid a heavy tax

2367
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:07,220
You pay him again now, and pay for the combined insurance

2368
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:10,660
Think about it, you have to file taxes twice a year

2369
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:13,100
Pay this tax once for the general tax

2370
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:17,420
Another time for health insurance will be paid again, you see how many people

2371
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:19,980
And the tax you keep is not a good tax in the first place.

2372
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:23,100
He must have defended the old pine later

2373
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:27,340
I don't know how you feel about Gu Song's way of defending

2374
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:31,660
If I feel it myself, it seems that there is nothing special

2375
01:34:32,660 --> 01:34:36,560
Every year when I declare the tax I keep, it is a very painful thing for me

2376
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,340
Because you pay a lot of taxes, you have to pay a lot of taxes

2377
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:43,340
That would be very painful, it would be like asking you to say that

2378
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:47,000
Because the payment is equal to the largest expenditure in the whole year, that's right

2379
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,060
Did you say that the health insurance association, I don’t feel anything special

2380
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:55,020
But NHS finances are doing really well now

2381
01:34:55,780 --> 01:34:57,280
Why is it good?

2382
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,280
because he received a lot of taxes

2383
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,300
How is this tax collected?

2384
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,020
That is, it has a wide range of tax machines

2385
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:04,600
Tax machine is very wide

2386
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:06,400
anything is welcome

2387
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,200
it has a discovery

2388
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:11,360
It is the income that encourages customers to pay a lot of taxes

2389
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:14,320
Such a small sword board would have been based on the new hand

2390
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,480
its for new hands

2391
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:18,120
A tax on re-customers other than hands

2392
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,320
other than novice

2393
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,040
For example, to encourage

2394
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,560
it receives a lot of tax

2395
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:23,960
another one

2396
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,560
it has another major discovery what is

2397
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,840
The major discovery is that

2398
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:31,440
Taiwan is under the original health care system

2399
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:35,360
The ones held by new hands are much lower

2400
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:37,560
much lower

2401
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:39,920
So it then says

2402
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,920
the part that doesn't hug you

2403
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:43,760
I will pay you an extra tax now

2404
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,960
it saw a huge increase in revenue

2405
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:49,640
So now health insurance

2406
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:51,760
it is financially

2407
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,240
look what happened not long ago

2408
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,360
Are you hugging someone and saying that your finances are bad?

2409
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:57,640
good income now

2410
01:35:58,800 --> 01:35:59,200
right

2411
01:35:59,400 --> 01:35:59,800
arrive

2412
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,800
Take a little from middle, take a little from C, I will engrave two pieces for you for 100 yuan

2413
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,000
do you feel it

2414
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
may not feel much

2415
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
It is a little bit eastward, but it has a lot of taxes

2416
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Very wide, you see, everyone in Taiwan only needs to pay one yuan

2417
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
What can you earn?

2418
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
More than 20 million

2419
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Because there are 23 million people

2420
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
You have to pay a dime, everyone pays a dime

2421
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
You have an income of more than 20 million

2422
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Think about it, if you pay 100 yuan to 100 yuan per person

2423
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
So its tax is very wide, very wide

2424
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
It draws a big circle, which is completely different from what it thinks is loud

2425
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,000
When it actually does, it doesn't complain now

2426
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
it says my taxes are fine

2427
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
It says finances are getting cheap money

2428
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
So that system, I think we might know

2429
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,000
There is a very important principle when collecting taxes

2430
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I hope it's forehead hair will be the same so that it won't feel pain

2431
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
like i said every year when the role, i'm in pain

2432
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Did you pluck too much forehead hair that time?

2433
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,540
I feel very uncomfortable

2434
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:02,780
i'm there every day

2435
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:03,780
my feet are so broken

2436
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:05,400
Especially considering that many people

2437
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,300
hands earn more money than me

2438
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:09,140
Broken feet, less than me, etc.

2439
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:10,140
very upset

2440
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:11,480
But at the health insurance meeting

2441
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:13,480
I believe you all feel nothing

2442
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:16,040
because he buckles

2443
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:17,680
come here for a smoke

2444
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:19,080
carve a little there

2445
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:20,740
But he has a lot of taxes

2446
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:21,780
tax is very wide

2447
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:22,680
like i said

2448
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:24,480
23 million people

2449
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,980
Only one foot per person

2450
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,280
just one dollar

2451
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:28,780
right

2452
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:30,780
He collected a bunch

2453
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:33,780
tantamount to tax design

2454
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:35,280
I think to think very differently

2455
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:38,280
Professor Yang Hello, Mr. Yang

2456
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,780
i want to ask two questions

2457
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:40,780
that is

2458
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:43,780
Professor Yang just mentioned

2459
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:45,280
part of the lock tax

2460
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:47,280
The country's locked tax areas are divided into

2461
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,780
Lock in the tax payment period during the silver interest period

2462
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,780
Personal comprehensive lock-in tax

2463
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:51,280
That

2464
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,280
Professor Yang here is mainly for

2465
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,280
Personal comprehensive lock-in tax

2466
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:56,280
real class lock

2467
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:58,280
One of the new locks

2468
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,280
Does it mean that this new lock is

2469
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,400
Why compared with the consumption tax

2470
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,640
If this is compared with consumption tax

2471
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:07,720
relatively representative

2472
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,040
The second question is

2473
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:13,080
In the past, our country focused on the income tax

2474
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:16,800
That's when the minimum tax was introduced

2475
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:19,120
What about the minimum tax system

2476
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:20,760
As Professor Yang said

2477
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,680
It's just that he's not included in the property tax.

2478
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:25,000
It's the property

2479
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,440
If it is included in the property

2480
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:28,520
to the minimum tax system

2481
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:30,400
will that follow

2482
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,640
because i'm not partisan

2483
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:34,240
I wonder if that will affect the vote

2484
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,680
You want to take money from the people

2485
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:43,840
I don't think that's a big deal for everyone.

2486
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,320
Moreover, there is a county in Taiwan that says that it often increases the price

2487
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,120
not only not from you

2488
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:50,240
He also lowered your taxes

2489
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,360
give you a lot of benefits

2490
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,080
No, you want to say that every year when the election

2491
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:55,120
The old man is overweight today

2492
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:56,640
Because, for example, the U.S. dollar factory overweight

2493
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,880
The KMT will continue to increase

2494
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
but take money from you

2495
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I think ordinary politicians don't dare to speak.

2496
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
not quite dare

2497
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
So what you said earlier

2498
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
I don't think so

2499
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
My point just says

2500
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
RSS

2501
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
what we just compared

2502
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
For example, compared with European and American countries

2503
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Like the United States, probably

2504
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
The new system of the first Russia probably accounted for 60

2505
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
About 56. more

2506
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Other capitals are about 48

2507
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
in other words

2508
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
The European Xi Jinping Country in Europe

2509
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
But Taiwan's words accounted for 75

2510
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
means

2511
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
from a certain point of view

2512
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
It means that other capitals have not grasped

2513
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Because of the words you have mastered in other countries

2514
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:44,000
The new system of the first Russia will not account for so high

2515
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Because Taiwan accounts for 75%

2516
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
even quite high

2517
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Compared with the data of those countries

2518
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
high

2519
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
means equal to other Russian

2520
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
not mastered well

2521
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
That makes you a new system of the first Russia

2522
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
75% of your tax return

2523
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
so

2524
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Didn't say what happened to other capitals

2525
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
i just say

2526
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,200
General impression of Taiwan

2527
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,360
The general impression is that

2528
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:06,640
Taiwan's personal broken hands seem to be broken minds

2529
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:08,760
From the data point of view, this concept

2530
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:11,040
not necessarily completely wrong

2531
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:12,360
Because compared to other countries

2532
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:13,760
It is indeed flat

2533
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:14,760
Ye Ping Gao

2534
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:19,600
Master Yang Liao

2535
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:20,880
I

2536
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:24,040
When Taiwan was broken, there was a lot of loss

2537
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:25,480
Simplest central government

2538
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:26,760
What about that water bottle?

2539
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:30,520
Inheritance tax, what kind of property tax can be lowered for him

2540
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,600
Did you talk about the Japanese one at that time?

2541
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:34,040
say clothing

2542
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:35,400
In fact, Taiwan also has

2543
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:36,120
Taiwan also has

2544
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:40,560
I worked in a trading company before retiring from a trading company

2545
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,440
all of that Taiwan

2546
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,360
to what extent do you capitalize me

2547
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:46,800
he has the tax office

2548
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,240
So he has the thermostat tube

2549
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:51,080
Just the latest newspaper, etc.

2550
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:53,280
He gave me a pipe for the police

2551
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,400
But the clothes are very busy

2552
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:57,840
He usually doesn't come just to check taxes

2553
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,240
Honglian was puzzled when he came

2554
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
I'll check it out, Honglian will only come during the holidays

2555
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
He was not happy during the investigation

2556
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
We have rules, you

2557
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
All the corner tax certificates are related to our car

2558
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,000
What about taxation, he helps beauties want to save Qilian

2559
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Then you are now in the 103rd year of the Republic of China

2560
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
He can say sorry

2561
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,000
We have a problem with your 98 year old one

2562
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
From July 31st to October 31st in 1998

2563
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Where can you show me? The company will hire two floats

2564
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Then go to the state-owned machinery, because our company's

2565
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:39,000
The business volume is 2 billion US dollars, let's go there

2566
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
OK OK OK so yes that's another point this

2567
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Because Taiwan is encouraging others, for example

2568
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,000
There is a joke that you just pick up the business card like someone else

2569
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Three times out of ten, Zhang said the chairman or general manager

2570
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
I have many friends who are doing this trade

2571
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Others can also apply for this trade

2572
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,020
Maoyu license, there are really regulations

2573
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:06,260
Your cat feather license company gives you

2574
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:10,660
If you have no business activities within three years, it will be canceled

2575
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:12,620
but i really can't find a business what to do

2576
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:13,700
I don't want to log out

2577
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:16,940
Because there are many advantages to not having to log out.

2578
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:19,220
like the one in my kids house now

2579
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:21,780
interior designer

2580
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:23,520
he has a license

2581
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:26,620
His motorcycle family can reimburse

2582
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:28,580
Is 40,000 a treat?

2583
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:31,280
Is it possible to report on business behavior?

2584
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:33,780
Report that execution?

2585
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:34,980
then my own motorcycle

2586
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:35,780
I'm going to do my best

2587
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:37,980
My car owner wants to refuel himself

2588
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:38,740
this is unfair

2589
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:40,780
So it shouldn't let you discount it

2590
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:42,540
then what should we do

2591
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:43,660
just looking for friends

2592
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:45,980
yours

2593
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:47,260
expanded to

2594
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:49,340
Even if the days come, the photos will not be lost

2595
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:51,220
Just use my name to ship

2596
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:52,220
yes

2597
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:54,900
So this kind of encouragement

2598
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:56,300
unfair tax system

2599
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:56,900
yes

2600
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:58,660
So your tax system

2601
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:00,100
say you are in hong kong

2602
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,000
In particular, there are many correct ways to set it up

2603
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,000
But just like this, the east factory and the west factory are all empty

2604
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Because it should be said that the reform of the sky should be more important than the reform of words

2605
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
yes

2606
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Thanks

2607
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:22,000
As you mentioned, it means that everyone should know each other in terms of academic qualifications.

2608
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:27,000
In fact, a Policy cannot be decoupled from its implementation

2609
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
You can't say I only talk about one Policy

2610
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
but did not talk about an implementation issue

2611
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
For example, I just talked about a tax matter

2612
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
when i just listened to him

2613
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
I feel good listening to my classmate

2614
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
but what you just said

2615
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Whether the tax affairs are good or not will lead to other issues

2616
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,000
for example

2617
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,000
So it is equivalent to a lot of times, it is a policy

2618
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
when implementing a policy

2619
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Can't be decoupled from your executive plane

2620
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
It performs very inefficiently

2621
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
For example, the boss of your company

2622
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:57,000
It stipulates that you can't buy a car for more than 2 million

2623
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Suppose you exceed 2 million

2624
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,740
He will ratify you to 2 million

2625
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:05,400
But the 2 million will be included in that asset

2626
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:08,000
In the list of sales assets

2627
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,840
He has a rule of forty percent

2628
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:12,040
So if our car exceeds 2 million

2629
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:14,040
forty percent

2630
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:16,540
800,000 in me

2631
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:18,040
I can pay taxes this year

2632
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:20,840
Then I will divide it into 10 years

2633
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:22,200
Everyone can take lessons

2634
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:23,800
but we didn't

2635
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:26,200
If there is no such thing as a job, there is no salary

2636
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:28,600
I bought that Yirong Zheqi 800,000

2637
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:30,000
i don't have a dime

2638
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
he pays for himself

2639
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,600
So this implementation aspect is really

2640
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:37,000
It's more important than you to reform a little bit

2641
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,040
a friend of mine just said

2642
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:38,900
sometimes taiwan

2643
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:40,840
The best day in Taiwan is to say

2644
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:42,900
start your own company

2645
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:44,400
It's big to report to work after eating

2646
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:45,800
Reporting a job is a big deal

2647
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:49,000
He said that this day in Taiwan

2648
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,700
will have a good time

2649
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:51,900
Of course he has rules

2650
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:52,900
you this

2651
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:54,400
look at him

2652
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
do you sometimes guess one

2653
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
I talked about

2654
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:17,000
i think in general

2655
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,000
If we look at the system in terms of money received

2656
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
of course

2657
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
The second-generation health insurance supplementary insurance fee is a lot of money

2658
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
But he actually received the most

2659
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Not the non-earn income part

2660
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
It's already paid for this

2661
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
This part of the so-called seller income

2662
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
because he has this

2663
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
In particular there is an insured salary scale

2664
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
The upper limit of the grading table is more than 180,000

2665
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
no class at all

2666
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
what about this part

2667
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
you don't have class

2668
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,000
but your boss wants to pay for you

2669
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
so this part

2670
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,000
let's just say

2671
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
That's 300,000 a month

2672
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Then you have 120,000 of this money

2673
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
yourself

2674
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,800
did not pay insurance premiums

2675
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:06,660
But the boss wants to help you pay this money every month

2676
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:09,460
this money adds up

2677
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:13,060
The second-generation health insurance supplementary premium was overcharged by 400

2678
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:15,620
Probably received 43 billion

2679
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:16,900
just this part

2680
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:19,720
The boss has more than 20 billion talents

2681
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:23,040
In fact, the money that encouragement actually accounts for is not much.

2682
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,340
for encouraging him to have another

2683
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:28,160
Everyone would know if they knew

2684
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:29,180
5000 yuan

2685
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:32,520
That is, there is no class below 5,000 yuan.

2686
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:35,320
So now a lot of interest is splitting bills

2687
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:37,120
Disassembled to say less than 5,000 yuan

2688
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:38,920
So now we need to amend the law

2689
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:41,480
It is the annual settlement

2690
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:42,500
that is

2691
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:44,300
avoid this part

2692
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:47,620
because too smart

2693
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:49,160
everyone is evading taxes

2694
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:50,940
We always blame the government

2695
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:53,500
But we are smart enough to say

2696
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:55,300
we will follow

2697
01:46:55,300 --> 01:46:56,580
this government

2698
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:59,660
He's pretending like we're here to play this

2699
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
game

2700
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,300
So actually

2701
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:05,160
talking about the whole system

2702
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,440
I just came to a conclusion that I think is very good

2703
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,440
that is

2704
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:09,740
ideal or

2705
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:11,000
system

2706
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,060
But this executive level

2707
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:15,880
if with some twist

2708
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:17,920
It's not just that it can't hit the target

2709
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,740
And it will greatly discount this fairness

2710
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:21,240
that's all

2711
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:32,920
then you check me to find out what's there

2712
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:33,840
that is

2713
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:34,860
It was said in the news before

2714
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:37,600
The rich in France are just dissatisfied with the way France treats them

2715
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,000
The heavier income tax or other taxes

2716
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,160
So I immigrated to Singapore directly.

2717
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:44,080
If our taxes are getting fairer

2718
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,760
But our powerful entrepreneurs

2719
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,600
or have the strength to create

2720
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,600
If the high-level people run away

2721
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,640
Isn't it bad for our country?

2722
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:54,360
of course it is

2723
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:57,640
So that means

2724
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:59,960
like us people

2725
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,960
That's the way to say it.

2726
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:05,260
It's not so easy for you to tax him

2727
01:48:05,260 --> 01:48:07,260
From a theoretical point of view

2728
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:09,260
That is to say, from the point of view of efficiency

2729
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:12,760
That is to say, for those incomes with relatively high liquidity

2730
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:14,760
The tax rate would have been lower

2731
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:15,760
From the point of view of efficiency

2732
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,260
less efficient

2733
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:19,260
So overall

2734
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:21,260
like i said taiwan has some structural problems

2735
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:23,760
You have a lot of companies in China

2736
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,760
Then teach the rich man

2737
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:27,760
So it's not as easy as we imagined

2738
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:31,220
It's not that we have to deal with those language people

2739
01:48:31,220 --> 01:48:33,720
We say positive education income you don't pay taxes

2740
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:35,720
so i will tax you

2741
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:38,720
This is theoretically more fair and just

2742
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:41,720
Because you have income, you don't have to pay taxes

2743
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:43,720
but when actually doing

2744
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:45,720
not as easy as we imagined

2745
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:49,720
Look at the tax reduction in our text last time

2746
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:53,720
But the economy as a whole has also become worse

2747
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:56,720
So this means

2748
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:58,720
This is a structural problem

2749
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:00,720
It's not that you're rich

2750
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,680
So you sleep with heavier feet

2751
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:05,000
not so simple

2752
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,680
may have a whole new and different idea

2753
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:08,880
new and different ideas

2754
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,680
structural issues like these

2755
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:12,980
How about a new idea for you

2756
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:14,920
New idea to engrave this problem

2757
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:18,000
instead of just saying how about fairness and justice

2758
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
like you just said

2759
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,480
These people run away when you're there

2760
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:21,960
Not good for Taiwan market

2761
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,720
It's like losing both

2762
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:25,160
so this should

2763
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:26,000
really want one

2764
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,800
It was a whole new and different idea

2765
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
come to ask a question

2766
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,280
That is to say, just at the beginning

2767
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:36,080
A school of economics in the United States is

2768
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:37,840
he thinks

2769
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:40,440
He said the most drastic way is to say

2770
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:43,240
Tax that should be expected with consumption tax

2771
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:45,520
And if I remember correctly

2772
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:48,680
Asked whether the director was with me at the time

2773
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:51,480
He said that Hong Kong seemed to be in a certain period

2774
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:53,600
very short period

2775
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:56,640
implemented this method

2776
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:59,400
Of course, because there are so many objections to legal persons

2777
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,520
There is no Xi Jinping who said to change his father's explanation

2778
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:05,800
So I'm going to ask two questions

2779
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:08,160
I don't know, subsidy chief, you don't have subsidy at this time.

2780
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,440
No

2781
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:12,040
You subsidize first because I'm going to talk and I'm coming to an end

2782
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:13,440
to finish

2783
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:19,840
I think because of the change in the last year

2784
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,320
Actually on this question

2785
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:24,160
Discuss with each other many times

2786
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:26,040
I don't think there's a definitive answer to this

2787
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:28,360
But we also recite many times

2788
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,600
I think this consumption tax is in Taiwan

2789
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:32,760
With Yang Jiahong, we are on the low side

2790
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:34,720
improve this direction

2791
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:35,560
yes but

2792
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:39,160
For some scholars, it is hoped that

2793
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:43,080
consumption tax can be substituted for all

2794
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:45,240
So this is controversial

2795
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:46,160
And with reservations

2796
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:48,840
No country in the world does this

2797
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,920
Then I want to follow the direction of Yang Jiahong

2798
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:52,840
all right but

2799
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:55,920
When designing this tax system, many

2800
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:57,320
has his first challenge

2801
01:50:57,320 --> 01:51:00,080
For example, when he was working, the concept of lifetime income and consumption

2802
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,000
It is perfectly feasible in a closed economic system

2803
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
But as he just said

2804
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
The broken locks are also difficult to grow

2805
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
I believe GST is also somewhat difficult to sleep on

2806
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Why

2807
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
A Taiwanese is a small open geographic system

2808
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,000
what i just said

2809
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
My family eats, drinks and has fun abroad

2810
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
May I ask how can I go to the class to pay the GST?

2811
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,000
So this part is actually not conclusive

2812
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,000
But basically Taiwan's consumption tax

2813
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
the lowest in the world

2814
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,000
So we ended up saying that we can slightly increase the

2815
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
But you make up some of the tax deficit

2816
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
but to completely replace

2817
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
we are law abiding

2818
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Thanks

2819
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
we're going to ask a very simple question

2820
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
that is

2821
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Because we can't read the whole proposal to change

2822
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:49,000
I have the impression that this idea also appeared in our report

2823
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,000
yes

2824
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Has it attracted the attention of any fiscal and taxation unit?

2825
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Indonesia knows

2826
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:59,000
From what I understand now, this shouldn't be the point

2827
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
now is not the point

2828
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,320
Now the Ministry of Finance is real estate

2829
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:04,720
he is a focus now

2830
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:08,000
But it's like raising the tax

2831
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,320
I think the general public is against it

2832
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,360
Therefore, the main reason is that it is generally recognized that

2833
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:14,200
GST is a split tax

2834
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:15,400
so you see

2835
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:18,960
like in five percent executive yuan

2836
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:21,560
He can skip the legislature

2837
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:23,760
He can directly increase to 7

2838
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:26,800
Because of the rules he can turn it up to 10

2839
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:29,400
But he was not moved at all

2840
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:31,360
why not touched at all

2841
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:34,960
It's obviously not an easy thing to do

2842
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:36,800
not easy thing

2843
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:39,240
Because it is generally believed that the consumption tax is a split tax

2844
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:42,000
disadvantageous to the poor

2845
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,800
as long as you are one

2846
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:44,640
or

2847
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:47,400
Right now it means he's turning it up by 5 to 10

2848
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:49,680
He doesn't have to go through the legislature

2849
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:51,440
but he was not moved

2850
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:51,880
not moved

2851
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:54,600
He is not even moved by 5 to 6

2852
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:57,360
It means that if the tax is raised, it will be very loud.

2853
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:59,360
And when you turn it up, think about it

2854
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,840
I imagine the prices will be raised as well.

2855
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:04,440
The whole will also be raised

2856
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:07,960
Because this increase is a bit similar to the preferential price of water and electricity.

2857
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:09,240
turn this up

2858
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:10,240
So this is tuned up

2859
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:12,680
Like Japan, hasn't he recently raised his voice?

2860
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:14,520
is good in the short run

2861
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,120
he has a big problem

2862
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:18,760
Long term is of course more difficult to say

2863
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:19,720
is good in the short term

2864
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:22,640
And what he said at the time

2865
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:24,640
is through how big a

2866
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:27,440
tantamount to the opposition

2867
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:28,440
Democratic Party

2868
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:32,440
agree with the ruling party

2869
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:34,440
The ruling party later stepped down

2870
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:36,440
equal to somewhat equal to

2871
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:38,440
The ruling party was then

2872
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:39,440
Promise to do this

2873
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:40,440
that cost a lot

2874
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:41,440
This price means

2875
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:44,440
If you turn it up, I'll let you step down

2876
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:46,440
this has to pay

2877
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:48,440
But Japan is a bit forced

2878
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:51,440
has come to a point where it doesn't

2879
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:52,440
far from enough

2880
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:53,440
have to

2881
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:54,440
but he is also

2882
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:55,440
was one equal to one

2883
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,440
It means that at that time the Prime Minister already had a

2884
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:59,440
It's like having a jig dance

2885
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,440
Just improve this and I probably won't be selected.

2886
01:54:02,940 --> 01:54:03,740
that result

2887
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:06,240
So the Prime Minister at that time did what he did, I think it was the same.

2888
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:07,800
is also full

2889
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:09,140
fruitful

2890
01:54:09,740 --> 01:54:10,640
fruitful

2891
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:11,800
you see Taiwan now you see

2892
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:13,340
You don't have to tune up by force show

2893
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:14,340
everyone dare not come

2894
01:54:14,340 --> 01:54:15,300
because you turn up the words

2895
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:16,500
This will be with water

2896
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:17,840
turn up the same

2897
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:20,300
This is bound to have serious consequences

2898
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:22,200
so everyone

2899
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:24,200
dare not do

2900
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:25,400
So what I thought of was

2901
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:26,700
There may be a way is

2902
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:29,500
Will raising this will lower the tax for new makers?

2903
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:30,200
there is one

2904
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:32,700
Having an equal is having an advantage like this

2905
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:34,300
Turn it up here

2906
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:36,200
But the new samurai tax brought it down like this

2907
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:37,700
Put it all together

2908
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:39,200
Perhaps the public may be more aware

2909
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:41,200
You only want to raise this, I think this

2910
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:42,600
I probably don't have it easy

2911
01:54:42,700 --> 01:54:44,000
not feasible these days

2912
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:44,900
not feasible

2913
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:47,600
our time is almost up

2914
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:50,300
US tax is a very difficult problem

2915
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:53,300
There are many problems with this tax in Taiwan

2916
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:54,800
very low on the one hand

2917
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:57,100
because I study history

2918
01:54:57,100 --> 01:54:59,300
The ratio of our current tax ratio

2919
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:00,100
tomorrow

2920
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Even lower than in the Qing Dynasty

2921
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,500
so it's a big problem

2922
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:07,500
But on the one hand, there are many people who do not pay taxes

2923
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:11,500
On the other hand, the country has no money to spend

2924
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:14,000
Every year, as Teacher Yang said

2925
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:15,500
Two to three hundred billion less

2926
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:17,000
Of course the one just mentioned

2927
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,500
The government randomly lowered it by two or three hundred billion

2928
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:22,000
These questions are very

2929
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,500
And the treaty is very difficult

2930
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:26,500
So what about today, Professor Yang will give us a detailed explanation from the beginning

2931
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:28,500
give us a very clear explanation

2932
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:29,500
very good speech

2933
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:31,500
thank him thank you
