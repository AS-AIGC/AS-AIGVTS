applause

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Li Xiaoyuan Li Tebin Researcher

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,900
And our Academia Sinica

17
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,400
Li Renhui's flamboyant potential

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,500
Cai Duoxiong

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,500
And ladies and gentlemen and students

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Goodnight everybody

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,800
Glad I came to see so many people today

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,000
Come and listen to the speech of Researcher Li Tebin

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is what I have hosted many times

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This is the first time I want to come to you

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,500
and it's not done yet

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Because many people are in other halls

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,000
watch TV wall

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,500
So thank you all for coming today

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,000
I think everyone cares about their own advice

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,500
In particular, Taiwan's social economy is developing more and more

31
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,000
When everyone's life is getting longer

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It is inevitable that you will face the problem of so-called dementia.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
or our family has dementia

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,500
everyone cares

35
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,000
Hope to care more about our family or ourselves

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,500
So today we also have a special understanding of our researcher Zhou Yan

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,740
Very distinguished scholar Li Xiaoyuan

38
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,940
A special researcher is here to share with you

39
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,020
Lectures on Amnesia and Dementia

40
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,160
Researcher Li Xiaoyuan actually

41
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,580
It's early when we sex fellows

42
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,320
He came here in 1983

43
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,920
I remember it was Academician Cai Zhongyong

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,600
We had the Institute of Biomedical Sciences

45
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,400
just in the preparatory stage

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,560
I was also at that time

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,200
also here

48
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,040
So we're pretty old colleagues

49
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,040
An old colleague of nearly 30 years

50
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,640
However, researcher Li Xiaoyuan's academic achievements

51
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
explain to me more

52
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,240
he is

53
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,440
His main field of study is learning

54
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,040
Discussion on the protective mechanism of memory and nervous system diseases

55
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,960
Dr. Li graduated from

56
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,400
Graduated from the Department of Psychology, National Chengchi University

57
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,640
Later to the University of California

58
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,240
Neuroscience Institute at UC San Diego

59
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,840
received a Ph.D.

60
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
and in

61
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
Green

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,800
is a year conducted by the Sendiego Department of Psychiatry

63
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,400
postdoctoral research

64
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Then in 1983, he returned to work in our holy hospital

65
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,800
that in these thirty years

66
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,900
He has published nearly a hundred papers during the international academic period

67
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,200
and it's all important

68
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
When he was chatting with me just now, he said

69
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,400
The first time he came back to see the paper written in

70
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,000
When Taiwan ROC of Academia Sinica

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,400
There is a feeling of caring for the country

72
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,800
This is when we would like to be in the United States

73
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,600
He actually had a good show in America for us in America

74
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,800
But he still feels

75
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,400
he should go back to this one

76
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,800
His favorite place to make his dedication

77
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Really amazing thirty years one day

78
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,400
did a lot of excellent research on this one

79
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Dr. Lee he once obtained

80
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,600
Top Ten Outstanding Young Women in the Tenth World of the Republic of China

81
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,800
And the winner of the National Science Council's Distinguished Award

82
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,800
There are also academic awards from the Ministry of Education for special research fellows

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,000
It is also the outstanding Baekwei of the Dynamic National Chengchi University

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
is an alumni

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Then a chair professor at National Chengchi University

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He has won several cutting-edge scientific research awards from the National Science Council

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Cutting-edge scientific research is not easy

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Probably people in the life science community in China

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
About Top 1%

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Top 1% still get this award

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Then Dr. Li won several cutting-edge research projects

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
All in academic research

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Not only recognized domestically

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
All of our cutting-edge research is sent abroad to please

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Reserved short review

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He has won several cutting-edge academic research awards

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
it's really not easy

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
today we are very happy

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He came to introduce us to today's topic

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I think everyone is curious about memory

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
In fact, people's memory has timely memory

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
short term memory vs long term memory

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
i remember i used to take care of

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
go to a nursing home to take care of

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
some old man

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There is a Catholic Lord

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
according to our catholic cross old place

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's funny that he can sing to you

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The story of Jiaocheng looks like this

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Not a single word is dropped

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
but he forgot to say

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He said I still need to eat

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But he has eaten for the third time

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
so his recent memory is great

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But long term memory is good

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
so he can remember

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
in the church before

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Activities with us

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
very detailed memory

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
but he doesn't remember

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The wife just left has hugged him

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
but also to hug the second time like this

123
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
so there are a lot of weird

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
such a reaction

125
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But this also shows the

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Taiwan is like what we just said

127
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The star description is getting longer and longer

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
then some people

129
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
unfortunately going into geriatrics

130
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What is the reason for the treatment of the elderly?

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
what is memory

132
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Then what is the mechanism of the nerve

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
can we prevent them

134
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
or how do we face

135
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Neuropathy

136
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I think everyone is concerned today

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,580
let's not talk

138
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,580
let's give a round of applause

139
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,280
Come welcome our protagonist today

140
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
Li Xiaolin

141
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Thanks

142
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
Thanks

143
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,840
Thank you Vice President for the invitation

144
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,580
Introduction to the Vice President

145
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,180
In fact, of course the deputy dean has already explained what I want to say.

146
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,980
The content of the first Sly

147
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,680
In fact, the vice president also understands

148
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,580
Then my research work at the Institute of Biology

149
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,600
My own field of research is about learning and memory

150
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,800
can you hear

151
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
tell me if you can't hear

152
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Over the past few years

153
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,600
I'll also talk about using the animal model

154
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,400
Do substantive research

155
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Hope especially Azehai's certified research

156
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,200
Hope to be able to have a little bit of human society

157
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
present a little evidence

158
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,000
A little bit more help and expressions

159
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,600
then i know you may be right

160
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
I am more interested in substantively proving this listening method

161
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,100
but i started

162
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,400
I still have to introduce

163
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Memory and the basic structure of nerve cells

164
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,920
and our brains

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,600
a basic structure

166
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,400
Because these foundations must have been

167
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,960
wait a minute and listen to me

168
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,960
You can better understand the administration and work

169
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
that's in all my fantasies

170
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,040
If I have this in the lower right corner

171
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,840
Logo's

172
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,300
it's me

173
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,300
The work done by Academia Sinica

174
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,540
if not

175
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,540
In fact, some of them I learned from textbooks or

176
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,540
YouTube is not found on internal videos

177
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,040
Because I am on this occasion

178
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,040
I can't speak very professionally

179
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,540
that will sound a bit strenuous

180
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,540
So I am a relatively popular family content

181
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,540
This will just be over

182
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,540
Human memory is divided into simple

183
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,540
short-term memory long-term memory

184
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,540
This instant memory is in minutes

185
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,540
even seconds seconds instant seconds

186
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,040
Do you think human beings need a lot of them?

187
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,040
for long time

188
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
I give two examples

189
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,540
You are assuming today that you are going to have a meeting outside one day

190
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,540
Why do you say you suddenly remembered

191
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,540
Today may be good audio and video

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
but you forgot to prepare a gift for him

193
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,960
so you might want to find a florist right away

194
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,760
or cake shop

195
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Then make a phone call and ask him to bring this gift

196
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,000
Or send flowers or send cakes to friends

197
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,320
this example

198
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,720
Now everyone's attitude towards sliding mobile phones is not accurate

199
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,440
but earlier

200
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,640
you might hit a trombone table

201
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,160
Or look up the phone number of a nearby flower shop

202
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,720
For example, 37681534 speaks casually

203
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,680
Then after you get this number

204
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,200
you just call this number

205
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,560
Then ask him to help you send the flowers to what address

206
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,360
Let's say this florist isn't your usual phone number

207
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,760
It is that you occasionally encounter this situation and need to use

208
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,760
Then you usually after this call

209
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
how long you don't need a few minutes

210
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
You should slowly forget this phone number

211
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,120
this is correct

212
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,880
or remember the full

213
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,920
Because it's not one you need to use often

214
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
This type of memory is called immediate memory

215
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,080
In fact, these two lives often need to

216
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
That short-term memory is another

217
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,840
Conceived by a little guide

218
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,260
This range is

219
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,960
There are too many examples

220
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
there are students doing

221
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,640
our students

222
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,440
when we were students taking exams

223
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,140
last note face down back to back

224
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,700
before the exam

225
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,800
You must recite it, right?

226
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,640
overcome exam

227
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,040
after the exam

228
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Usually several two to three weeks

229
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,640
usually a lot of money back

230
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,140
just forget

231
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,440
that's normal

232
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,580
I was normal with you just now

233
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,740
and it's important

234
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,140
what should be forgotten is to forget

235
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,420
because not everything

236
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,420
let us always remember

237
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,520
This is for our neurovascular

238
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,120
It's a tiring thing

239
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,220
unless the matter is

240
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,120
Do you think you should keep it forever

241
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,220
that memory is often

242
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,820
related to our survival

243
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,620
then long term memory

244
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,320
This is how we humans compare

245
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,520
comparison is emphasizing

246
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,120
several decades

247
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,420
I can say I'm old now

248
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,720
will be like when i was a teenager

249
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,420
what happened when you were twenty

250
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,320
why these things

251
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,320
i will remember for so long

252
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,120
then for example

253
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,820
for example

254
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,020
This machine is sometimes

255
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,560
It's not good. For example, when the 921 earthquake occurred

256
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,400
Puli Earthquake

257
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,960
If at that time

258
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,360
people who saw this disaster

259
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,360
long term memory

260
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,560
next time you come to Puli

261
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,600
or you don't go to pulley

262
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,960
see these two words

263
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,160
you may recall that memory

264
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,560
This is long term memory

265
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,320
Just like what happened on the MRT recently

266
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,000
He can't forget the people he saw at the scene

267
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
In fact, his age is what he still remembers

268
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,560
So roughly divided into these three

269
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,960
Then divide the time like this

270
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,200
that his history

271
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,960
Usually our executive memory is stimulated first

272
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,720
Come on, this stimulus is usually in terms of what we have nothing to do

273
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,920
Children today, nose smell, morality, etc.

274
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
This is usually based on our senses

275
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,260
This stimulus goes through a filtering system

276
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,760
and then into our immediate memory

277
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
I call this filtering

278
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,720
Let me give you an example

279
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,800
If you are at Taipei Main Station today

280
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,600
Except the MRT station

281
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,920
a lot of people walking around

282
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,200
what we usually do

283
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
we're going to do this

284
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Let's see if I can find anyone

285
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The common sense is to let the human-like part of this movie begin to pass

286
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
unless you wait and see a person

287
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So this category is

288
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Our nervous system does a lot of physical work

289
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
let our feelings mature

290
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
exposed to these stimuli

291
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
after the vast majority

292
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and was thrown out too much

293
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
because we don't need to be specific about everything

294
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Dupei is hungry and mature, continue to do it

295
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
have something in immediate memory

296
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
or you may

297
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Oops, I suddenly saw a friend

298
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
This friend met 20 years ago

299
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
but there may be no connection

300
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So say hello and go

301
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
you might even think of other names

302
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
immediate memory

303
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Immediate memory then passes through our nervous system

304
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Filtering Mechanisms of the Nervous System

305
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
then filter out

306
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
there are some short doses

307
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
this kind of time is a bit short

308
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
For example, what the teacher said in class

309
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
if you don't know how to communicate

310
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
but honestly

311
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,500
That is to say, this thing is very important

312
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,000
I may take one of the exams and accept the exam

313
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,500
then you will pay a little attention

314
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,500
So some things are selectively moved to short-term memory

315
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
and some more filtered

316
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,000
long term memory

317
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,500
There are some things that are very important to human survival

318
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
very influential very important

319
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
sometimes skip this

320
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
From immediate memory to long-term memory

321
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,500
For example, where is the screen like that seen on the prison

322
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Then I want to talk about the mechanism of this filter in the human

323
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
is very important

324
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
That is to say, our nerve cells

325
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,500
No need to register every stimulus

326
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
we talk about register

327
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
we don't need to do this

328
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
No need because if that's the case

329
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
our neurons get tired

330
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
but this phenomenon

331
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,500
Its importance in psychiatry

332
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,500
means you know something about this

333
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Of course I'm not that psychiatrist

334
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
but i know this phenomenon

335
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,500
That is to say, some patients with schizophrenia

336
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
He actually has no intellectual problems

337
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There is no problem with his intelligence and his administrative memory

338
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
but he

339
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
you probably know

340
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Some mental and professional patients

341
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
There will be things like auditory hallucinations and fantasies

342
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
he can feel and see

343
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Hearing a lot of sounds or images

344
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Actually we are

345
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We ourselves, ordinary people can't feel it

346
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
that reason is because

347
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
One reason is because patients like this

348
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The filtration system of his neurovascular cavity is defective

349
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So he can't rule out some

350
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
irrelevant stimulus

351
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
he takes all the stimuli

352
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Lots of stimuli are registered

353
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
so he'll see what you can't see

354
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
hear something you can't hear

355
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Then such a person is actually very tired

356
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Because his nerves and blood cavity are tired

357
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
something bloody

358
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So suppose you have someone who knows

359
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
or your friend or something

360
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Such a phenomenon is actually

361
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
long

362
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The phenomenon is actually a little bit

363
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
a little bit dangerous

364
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
as far as i would suggest

365
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I should look at the meaning of lower body Hengge

366
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
short term advice he goes to short term advice everywhere

367
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
For example, some of the sex and areas of our brain

368
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
wait a minute i will introduce

369
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Long-term memory is also stored in long-term memory

370
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Our long term memory is stored in our big old flat city

371
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
right in your skull

372
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Now we are knocking on the skull of Hehai

373
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Below it is Tate Old Pingcheng

374
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
wait a minute i'll show you

375
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Our memory is stored there

376
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
we humans

377
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
not only humans

378
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
including rats

379
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
mouse

380
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
This is not enough animal

381
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
where memories are formed

382
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
See where memories are stored

383
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
are different

384
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
good division of labor

385
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll talk about it later

386
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
just like that

387
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
but today if something

388
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You need to retrieve it from long-term memory

389
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
for example

390
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
When you go through Jiangzi's reminder to fight again

391
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
20 years later

392
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
you may still remember that scene

393
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
This is a way to retrieve it from long-term memory

394
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Retrieval of short-term memory

395
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
for example

396
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You memorized for a long time

397
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
There will be an exam in a week

398
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
so when you take the exam

399
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
see those memories

400
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
this is what i carried

401
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So you figure out how to store it from short-term memory

402
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
you take what you have carried on your back

403
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Take it out to write the test paper

404
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,240
So it goes like this basically a shorthand

405
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,380
this is the relationship

406
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,620
And here is an important memory

407
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,840
Which means only we humans have only long-term memories of getting out of town

408
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,080
required for the synthesis of new proteins

409
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,780
We have neuroses in our brains, proteins in belly parts

410
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,960
But if the protein is a new protein

411
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,420
DNA

412
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,840
It is a step like deoxynucleic acid nucleic acid

413
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,300
make protein

414
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,420
Only long-term memory requires new protein synthesis

415
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,680
None of these short-term immediate memories are needed

416
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,880
synthesis of new proteins

417
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,280
it's you in the nerve cells

418
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,140
Some modifications to existing proteins are enough

419
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,060
other memories out of town

420
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,640
first have other this concept

421
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,820
good

422
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,520
Then let's introduce other nerve cells

423
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,520
Our nerve cells generally look like this

424
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,960
I mean the nerve cells in the brain

425
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,000
this is its cell body

426
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,240
The most important area is the nucleus

427
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,040
Basically did not stand in such a big bottom

428
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,760
Its body will be bigger

429
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,940
Elements related to our life information and software

430
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,740
Everything in the DNA is inside the nucleus

431
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,040
Heart protein core needs this too

432
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,280
it's on the periphery of its cell body

433
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,640
There are many such branches

434
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,680
like its name tree diagram

435
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,380
It just looks like a big tree

436
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,640
trunk with branches

437
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,840
Then branch and then have small branches

438
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,900
really like a tree

439
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,400
So Chinese is translated into a tree diagram

440
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,580
Then what

441
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,680
When the outside world came across this tree diagram once

442
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,260
This cell produces some electrical signals

443
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,360
The electrical signal follows the axis diagram

444
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,160
pass to the end of a mysterious situation

445
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,260
where's the end of it

446
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,860
It's also like our big tree

447
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,600
under the tree

448
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,900
like the branch under the chair

449
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,280
so it has many branches

450
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,280
For each branch it has this called

451
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,780
it has a bump

452
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,880
We say it contains a lot of chemicals

453
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,580
wolf-like thing

454
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,260
when it hits the magnet

455
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,960
This potential signal transmits the message to the terminal

456
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And these branches at the end

457
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,160
Then make a link with the next nerve cell diagram

458
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,160
I'll wait and there's a video I need to show you

459
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,660
That's how the message gets passed

460
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,760
Most of our nerve cells

461
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,260
Many of our nerve cells are

462
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,460
Then the outer layer of the bread is called Suiqiao

463
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,560
it's some plowed gills

464
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,700
some glycols

465
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,060
some glycolipid stuff

466
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,960
sugar-stimulated lipids

467
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,320
Our general axis graph transmission speed is per second

468
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,700
0.5 to 2 meters

469
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,460
also very happy

470
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,060
A person's body length is so fat in one second

471
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,660
one long so fast

472
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,660
But with the tuned axis plot it passes to

473
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,260
You can see 120 meters in one second

474
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,360
very fast

475
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,560
This class of cells with axis plots

476
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,660
Usually during, for example, sensorimotor heatstroke

477
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,560
For example, if someone scolds you

478
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,760
You won't call that great

479
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,460
do you cry after half an hour

480
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,560
or angry

481
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,160
This message travels fast

482
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,560
someone hit you or something

483
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,060
you can run right away or go back

484
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,160
you won't wait long

485
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,460
I'll be back in 20 minutes

486
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,360
This kind of conduction is conduction with tune

487
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
know a little bit

488
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I just said that we have electricity

489
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
This is where the action potential starts

490
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
then pass the signal on

491
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So our brain basically has two nerve cells

492
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
two features

493
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
One is electricity, the other is chemistry

494
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
When electrical signals are transmitted to nerve cells

495
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
If there is a severed hand, there will be a release of chemicals

496
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
release to the next nerve cell

497
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Then I said, there will be a potential when stimulated

498
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
After the electric potential this nerve cell

499
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
This period of time is very important, called the recovery period

500
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
that is to say during this time

501
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
it will be better than normal

502
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The normal center is not easily stimulated

503
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
so react

504
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It means that our nerve cells

505
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
In fact, once you work

506
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
After it needs to activate, it needs to rest

507
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
at this stage

508
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You just give it a stronger stimulus

509
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
it won't respond either

510
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
this is our nerve cell

511
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
a protection mechanism against itself

512
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Because it can't stand on the face all the time

513
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
active, always active

514
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
always in an active state

515
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
then resting

516
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
it's slowly resting

517
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Then start preparing for the next stimulus

518
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Here is a schematic

519
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
just tell us

520
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
This nerve cell conducts electricity

521
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
send the message under here

522
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And below this is another neuron

523
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
place of tree soil

524
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Let's zoom in on this white space

525
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
that's it

526
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
wire vesicles

527
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
These cysts are stimulating in terms of

528
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
it will break

529
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Then some chemicals in it

530
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
These round red

531
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
it will be released

532
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
released

533
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
it will go down

534
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
On the tree soil of the next nerve cell

535
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
on a specific receiver

536
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
This is very important

537
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
this particular idea

538
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
They are concepts with structure and function

539
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
This is called structure function

540
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
it won't just find a place

541
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
do it

542
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
not like the wind blows

543
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
this matter is very important

544
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
it just does the wrong place

545
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The message transmission after it is all wrong

546
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Then look at where its nerve cells are

547
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What kind of problems will it cause us humans?

548
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
This middle control place is called Synapse

549
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Synapse in Chinese

550
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
synapse

551
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'll show you later

552
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
the signal is like this

553
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Nerve cells communicate one by one

554
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,960
I don’t know why this video was released yesterday

555
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,100
It was a bit broken when I released it just now.

556
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,260
so i show you this

557
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,760
a piece of words

558
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,800
So I think the lights should be able not to look back

559
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,400
this one you can see

560
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,760
wait a minute i animate it

561
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,900
you'll see under a microscope

562
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,900
this nerve cell

563
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,660
when it sticks out

564
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,160
The end of the axis chart sticks out

565
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,500
as slowly

566
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,100
Connect with this plasticine of nerve cells

567
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,900
Then how to pass the message over

568
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,700
very interesting

569
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,100
really photographed under a microscope

570
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,600
you can take a look

571
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,500
See? Shake hands

572
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The phenomenal quantity of connections astounding in their inter-ca-see and complexity eventually number in the trillions.

573
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's these connections that allow neuron to neuron communication, the basis of all great activity.

574
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Neurons talk to each other in a two-step process using electricity and chemistry, electrical...

575
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Thank you.

576
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,200
For memory, I just need to talk about a psychedelic film

577
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,700
tell a very simple theory

578
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,200
But this theory is so important because

579
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,400
1949 I don't quite remember now

580
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Is this from Spain or from which country?

581
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,000
The Great Chinese Teaching of Neuropathy

582
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Turn it up in Chinese

583
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You know there are long and long in the book

584
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
He proposed a consolidation theory

585
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That is to say, your Chinese can be thought of as solidification theory

586
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That is why a neuropathic cell

587
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Connect with another neuron to exchange ideas

588
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Then finally memory can be formed

589
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What is his hypothesis

590
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
A when this nerve cell receives a stimulus

591
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
make it exciting

592
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
it sends some exciting news

593
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
to the B cell

594
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
B then sends this message

595
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
to the neuron of C

596
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I think these neurons are all brains

597
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It has nothing to do with the arm

598
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Then C this nerve cell

599
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Pass this exciting message to D

600
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
D will pass back to A

601
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So talk about Lanlan Huihui Lanlan Huihui

602
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
This is more formal

603
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
just a simple idea

604
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
There is a group of nerve cells in Lanlan's back

605
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,600
sad heart

606
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,080
And this group of cells

607
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,000
If they happen to be sitting

608
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
relatively close

609
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,360
they're in their head again

610
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,000
If the responsible functions are the same

611
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,400
Then these cells

612
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,000
deconstruction

613
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,240
If this group of cells happens to be responsible for memory

614
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,240
That is

615
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,240
One of the purposes of our long-term memory formation

616
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,160
cell biology

617
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,000
It is a physiological structure

618
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
his theory

619
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
until now still

620
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,600
also used by biologists

621
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,200
So if he loads

622
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
he'll get someone else's award

623
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,600
good

624
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
this is us

625
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
side view of this brain

626
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
it's very simple

627
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
just like me

628
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
This is what I'm standing on now

629
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
then i just said

630
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
this is the outermost

631
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,600
just this one white this one

632
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
white top

633
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
is our skull

634
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
you can touch it now

635
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
Our skulls are not too thick

636
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,600
In fact, the skull is several people

637
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,600
i think at most one centimeter

638
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
To be honest, a few centimeters too much

639
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,560
But this head cover is trying to

640
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,600
of our brains

641
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,400
This part is the cortex of the brain

642
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,960
Because the cerebral cortex actually occupies a large part of the

643
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
It is divided into sixty percent

644
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,060
Our brains are soft

645
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,080
It's all about the brain

646
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,100
actually soft

647
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,380
After removing the head cover

648
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,940
Westerners say the brain is like cheese

649
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,000
We Chinese say the brain is like tofu

650
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,760
you just

651
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,280
Probably know

652
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,040
ah that person

653
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,840
but he knows

654
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,880
so you know sometimes cutting tofu is not so good

655
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,920
Some of you said that the knife will go down

656
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,460
It just sinks, it doesn't necessarily cut down

657
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,720
But sometimes you have to use the line

658
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,020
I don't want to take it up like this

659
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,060
so it may be squishy

660
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,900
This cerebral cortex is in the following areas

661
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,520
The cerebral cortex is below

662
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,320
These areas are the class-related areas of the communal district

663
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,380
they are very important

664
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,200
So evolutionarily where they do

665
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
not on the outside

666
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,000
Because the brain you said has something

667
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,800
more serious than us

668
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,360
I hold my hand off

669
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,240
It is not these evolutionary

670
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:11,800
This is an evolutionarily important region

671
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,420
So it's in the deepest part of our brains

672
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,440
you can watch like this

673
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,800
So it's a circle like this

674
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,320
Such a circle structure is called seahorse ghost

675
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,960
look from the top of that bag

676
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,600
Around here in a circle like this

677
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,160
I'm talking about this area because

678
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,880
This area is related to our learning and memory

679
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
too obvious

680
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,620
Do you think of any learning and memory patterns

681
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,120
it's responsible for everything i can almost say

682
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,160
It's important that you remember the name

683
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,360
Then its special important role is Ren Lu

684
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,760
The formation of the concept of spatial space

685
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,160
how do you know

686
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,120
For example, how do you go to find a friend?

687
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,160
Because there's a right turn over there

688
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,880
Then there's SF over there and you have to turn left

689
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,880
Then look at the gas station and turn left and so on

690
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,200
Now it’s more inaccurate, now everyone takes the MRT

691
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,600
I only know which port to come out from the naval battle

692
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,800
direction has longer

693
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,000
But I said why do you know how to get to these places

694
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,600
if these

695
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,400
These are some of the clues on the space

696
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,800
There is a way to say

697
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
That's how the teaching method is

698
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,200
It is also to let us form a cognitive map

699
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,600
Cognitive Map

700
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,400
so you know how i know to go home

701
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,200
You see there's already a refueling round here

702
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,600
next one next

703
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
did not follow him

704
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
what's his difference

705
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,400
In particular, it has a lot to do with any effort

706
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,200
another district

707
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,000
His is a little below

708
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,600
I don't know that I'm so deep

709
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,900
His name is Almond River

710
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,300
He came because of his name

711
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,500
Because of Zhuang style Almond River

712
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,000
I am also not certain

713
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
This very common Chinese saying is Han Xingrenhe

714
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,200
He also learned memory from us

715
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,000
very concerned

716
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,700
And he plays an important role

717
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,400
is disgusting with us

718
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,900
hate this

719
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It's about memory, that's what you hate

720
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,320
Others think I hate eating a food

721
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
eggplant

722
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,760
so you've had sugar before

723
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,720
you may think it tastes bad

724
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,960
So next time that dish will be served

725
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,640
if eggplant

726
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,600
Your memory will come back and say

727
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,280
i don't want to eat it

728
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,680
this thing is terrible

729
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,880
That memory is here

730
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,680
memory formation

731
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,560
But in the end it will be re-stored to the brain Heisei

732
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,960
then this place is very interesting

733
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,440
That is to say

734
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,800
if you see something you don't like

735
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,560
you had a fight with him

736
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,320
you don't get on well with him

737
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,960
so you might see it from afar

738
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,400
You may want to Gupi you to eat a lot

739
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,760
I don't want to mess with it

740
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
you don't like that person's memory

741
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,800
also exists here

742
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,760
So this evolutionary lower animal

743
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,880
it is actually more important

744
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,000
like a belly

745
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,520
he wants to see

746
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,240
He once watched his mate get eaten by a tiger

747
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,680
So he has to see from afar

748
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,200
next time he sees a wife forever

749
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,600
he is extroverted to escape

750
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,560
That memory is in sexual nature

751
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,440
So in the lower animals

752
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,640
It's about survival

753
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,520
there is also an interesting phenomenon

754
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,040
that is

755
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,560
as I just said

756
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,000
Some people don't get along well with others

757
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,080
For example, in actual 20 years

758
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Let's say this guy later gets dementia

759
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
He forgot to go out with this person

760
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
he'll go over and say hello

761
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
so this place

762
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
If the function is slightly weaker

763
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It will also make human beings forget about hatred.

764
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
yes, then there will be something like this

765
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So these are two things that have nothing to do with our experience

766
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Then I will say that these two areas are Hexue

767
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
objection formation

768
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Long-term manager formation

769
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
After forming

770
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
After the memory is formed

771
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
after a while

772
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
these formed memories

773
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
will move to the cerebral cortex to be stored there

774
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
this thing is interesting

775
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You can put the cerebral cortex

776
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Think of it as a computer hard drive

777
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
those areas

778
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You can think of it as your pen drive

779
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
or the job you call it out of

780
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So not only are you all files

781
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
you will need

782
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So you put a

783
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
in the hard drive you don't usually use

784
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
One day when you need to take out its memory

785
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You may put that hard drive again

786
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
connect to your computer

787
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Then call out the file you let me

788
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,260
you can think of it this way

789
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,000
So in a situation where the world is consistent

790
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,300
There will be a situation where

791
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,040
when it started

792
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,000
it's not in these areas

793
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
it has no way to form

794
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,960
very new memory

795
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,160
Just now Fu Yuanang said

796
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,300
he was yesterday or when

797
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,360
just give someone a hug

798
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,540
i asked one thing

799
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,400
how many hours did he go

800
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,840
or he forgets the next day

801
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,800
Because he can't form new memories

802
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,200
But you ask him long ago

803
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,000
his memories for you say

804
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,600
what was he like twenty years ago

805
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,200
what happen

806
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,440
how did he remember this

807
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,340
so usually day and night

808
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,840
you start with these

809
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,240
learning and memory

810
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,800
in case a defect occurs first

811
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,700
Of course it sucks to wait till the end

812
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,500
Because he doesn't know the way home

813
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,240
he's the last one who won't recognize

814
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,200
his family

815
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,800
all these are

816
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,340
These are the stages behind them

817
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,900
That is, the function of cerebral sebum is not

818
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,200
So start with this place of memory

819
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,100
Then finally to the storage place without

820
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,400
Then our brains store memories

821
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,600
There is another feature

822
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,440
just okay

823
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,600
This is the evolutionary protection for us

824
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,800
such a big brain

825
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,600
so much sebum

826
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,700
But our memory is stored

827
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,700
but different

828
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,300
unlike the formation of our memories

829
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,700
so confined to these areas

830
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,900
it is area theory

831
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,500
it is anywhere

832
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,800
So you assume today the brain sebum

833
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,700
5 to 10 percent of injuries

834
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
it doesn't matter

835
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,900
because you may only be around that

836
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,100
your memory is impaired

837
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,100
But the other 90% or more are OK

838
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,400
So there is no specific point in what you divide

839
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,900
But when memory is formed

840
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,300
do you have a specific meaning

841
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,700
Then this reflects a direction

842
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,900
If you look at it like this

843
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,900
we just didn't talk

844
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,900
this is the cerebellum

845
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,900
This is the cerebellum

846
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,700
so we people

847
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,100
It has more to do with our balance

848
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,100
But this is better in birds than in seas

849
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,100
also plays the main role

850
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,600
So in fact you can actually see

851
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,400
cerebral sebum

852
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,100
Its area is full and relatively small

853
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,300
Then this is serious

854
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,500
we talk about your life

855
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,700
say breathing heartbeat blood pressure here

856
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,300
So a person can be unconscious

857
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,400
It's the brain without consciousness

858
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,500
but it breathes heartbeat blood pressure

859
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,700
can stay there

860
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,400
it's bad

861
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,000
This is a vegetative state

862
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,800
and here it is

863
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,300
Dry

864
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,300
Just start from here

865
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,140
spine down

866
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,020
this is the brainstem

867
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,340
Okay, this is not turning around

868
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,000
turn around and look this way

869
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,940
So what I want to tell you is that

870
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,740
This is our middle waist hook

871
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,740
If we want to divide

872
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,220
This is the sensory area behind it

873
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,520
That is to say, if I hit you today

874
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,020
Your signal will first pass through the spine to the back

875
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,180
after all received

876
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,820
dorsal side of the spine

877
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,820
Turn up, turn around, turn to the brain

878
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,180
send here

879
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,020
feel

880
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,680
Then it will command

881
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,920
can command to the front

882
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,220
In front of the middle waist hook is actually the sports area

883
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,620
it will send the message to its motor area

884
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,520
then this time

885
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,020
we'll make a move

886
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,020
answer or run away

887
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,660
It is the feeling area on the thigh surface of the middle waist hook

888
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,660
then the sports area is in front

889
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,800
I mainly want to tell you this

890
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,960
you don't need to worry about these

891
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,140
that's brainy

892
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,700
You now see that there is another very important feature

893
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,340
You see there are many wrinkles

894
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,340
A lot of wrinkles, right?

895
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,260
you go

896
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,360
why is that

897
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,700
Wrinkle is a very space-saving

898
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,760
If you remove all these wrinkles

899
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,720
spread out

900
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,420
then the surface area of ​​our brains becomes very large

901
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,800
wrinkle in unevenly

902
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,560
In this way you will become very compat

903
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,600
Let's talk about a car compat car

904
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,100
It's just so tightly packed.

905
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,360
So it is a space saving design

906
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,840
It is the result of evolution

907
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,380
So our heads won't be as big as sea elves

908
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,600
Why do you have such a big head?

909
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,800
Yes, it is a burden for us

910
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,960
So the evolution sprite is very streamlined

911
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,380
But in this streamlined mind

912
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,880
We have nearly 100 billion god cells

913
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,180
just incredible

914
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,580
I'll wait for the way to get the crown

915
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:42,180
So the more evolved animals are the more wrinkled

916
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,040
Second only to us are monkeys

917
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,580
Mouse brains also wrinkle a lot

918
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,120
I would say that human beings have quite a lot of wrinkles.

919
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,680
I mainly show you this

920
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,080
sensorimotor area

921
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,380
This one was found in a textbook room a long time ago

922
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,720
But now I can't find it in this textbook

923
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,220
that has its meaning

924
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Cut it like this, look at it like this, look at the next six and a half years

925
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
What this graph tells us is that

926
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
in the cortex of the brain

927
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
The temperature of our movements and sensations

928
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
In the corresponding area of ​​the cerebral cortex

929
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
He has a little intention to tell us that it is exhausted and discarded

930
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It's also about evolution

931
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
He doesn't necessarily buy a person's hands and face

932
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
The feet are not necessarily here

933
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
mean to tell us

934
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
in our limbs

935
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
what do we use most humans

936
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
it's hard to deal with

937
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
no comments

938
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
what do we do with

939
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Then put your finger inside

940
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Large membrane fingers are used the most

941
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So his feeling is very fine

942
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Cortex in our brain

943
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
of the motor functions of our hands

944
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
occupies a considerable area of ​​our brain

945
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
so fine

946
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You can take it and knock a brick with your hands

947
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
But you can also thread a needle

948
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It's very delicate to thread this needle

949
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,440
Actually moving things is very different

950
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,000
So he needs very fine control

951
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,440
That foot is longer

952
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,040
We just walk and basically

953
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,200
The other one is our face

954
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
facial expression

955
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,000
Of course you don't know if it's good or not

956
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,680
We use our mouths too much

957
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,480
just do two things

958
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,400
one is speech

959
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,400
That's less than two years may be better

960
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,280
The other one is eating

961
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,080
to eat

962
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,720
so a very interesting

963
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,520
schematic diagram

964
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,080
That's what he said in his head

965
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,400
A distribution of sensory and motor functions

966
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,000
with his functional one

967
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,280
ok now i'll show you one more level

968
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,720
wait a minute and pay attention

969
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,560
At the beginning of this video

970
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,240
There will be a rotating map of the human brain

971
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,720
you pay attention

972
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,040
If you look at him right in the middle

973
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,240
Our brains are symmetrical between the left and right hemispheres

974
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,360
Then later he introduced

975
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,640
every nerve

976
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,200
How to connect with nerve blood hair

977
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,120
I just talked about two

978
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
a phenomenon, an electricity, a chemistry

979
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
These are the planets that the gods wish for that are real in our minds

980
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I just think these gods hope to be beautiful and unbelievable

981
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
This is what the gods hope

982
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So you can take a look at that

983
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
maybe a little perspective

984
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,320
what shape does each have

985
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,720
Neurons come in thousands

986
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,360
perhaps tens of thousands of different kinds

987
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,880
each with a unique shape

988
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,000
a distinct molecular composition

989
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,520
and a unique pattern of connections within the brain

990
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,240
ok

991
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,040
so you see it twinkle

992
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,600
That's the signal it generates electricity

993
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,640
To send a message to the next cell

994
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,880
Then you just saw it in

995
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,880
You may remember that when the brain spins

996
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,880
You can see the change view from the central tick

997
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,880
If it is not viewed from the middle, the left and right are symmetrical

998
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,880
Then I want to emphasize that

999
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
Structurally speaking, our brain

1000
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
Left and right are symmetrical

1001
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,880
But our function is asymmetric

1002
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
it's amazing

1003
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,880
In terms of us humans

1004
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,880
Chasing our left brain is responsible for language

1005
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,880
So suppose we have a language area in the left brain

1006
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,880
That part of the cerebral cortex is the language area

1007
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
so if that place hurts

1008
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
Whether trauma or swelling

1009
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,880
that person's

1010
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Ability to speak can be affected

1011
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,840
Women's Zhongshu is here

1012
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,640
Then our right brain generally speaking

1013
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,640
From the point of view of scientists

1014
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,840
is more about artistic abstraction

1015
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,440
features like music

1016
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
so you just think

1017
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,000
what is bad about art

1018
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,200
It may be that the function of the right brain is less

1019
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,080
so it is

1020
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,080
The result is symmetrical and the function is asymmetrical

1021
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,600
There is another characteristic

1022
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
The whole sense of the brain and our limbs

1023
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
The senses are crossed

1024
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So what the right eye sees

1025
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,600
its image after crossing

1026
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,800
almost here

1027
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
is projected to the back of the left brain

1028
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
What you see on the left is the right brain

1029
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
so are the ears

1030
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
So I think there will be such a phenomenon

1031
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,600
That is to say, assuming a moderate patient

1032
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
it is a hemorrhage that hurts the left brain

1033
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,600
A blood clot presses into its nerve haemoperitoneum

1034
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
left nerve hematomania damage

1035
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
It is often unable to move the right hand and right foot

1036
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,600
or right brain injury

1037
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,600
It will be unable to move the left hand and left foot

1038
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,800
Don't go into the details of these neurotic encounters

1039
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,660
but you know this

1040
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,700
Our brains are not as good as those of animals.

1041
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,140
rats are like this

1042
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,900
to a basic feature

1043
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,980
Adjustment with one of his functions

1044
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,020
you just saw

1045
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,940
Wrapped outside our heads, underneath our brains

1046
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,820
actually very light

1047
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,180
We weigh tens of kilograms

1048
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,740
Our brains are only about three or four pounds

1049
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,660
very small very light

1050
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,860
But our brains

1051
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,020
80 billion to 100 billion nerve cells

1052
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,260
This is undeniable

1053
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,260
previous rottenness was

1054
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,660
But now the newer ones are just

1055
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,260
Because 80 billion is a lot

1056
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,020
eight hundred billion ten

1057
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,580
The tenth room is completely stuffed in

1058
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,940
We say these wrinkles surface, the inside of the face

1059
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,580
Diameter of each neurovascular chamber

1060
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,380
about twenty five to thirty

1061
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,060
Minecraft

1062
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,460
Minecraft is ten of the rot six magnetic room denunciation

1063
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,700
you can go home by yourself

1064
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,460
deproportional release

1065
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,540
Everyone see how small he is

1066
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,180
But he functions like this

1067
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,580
Every neurovascular video we just watched

1068
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,060
look

1069
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I also talked about it making connections with other nerve cells

1070
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,740
for the purpose of message delivery

1071
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,940
Each nerve cell can see nearby

1072
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,980
sometimes far

1073
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,940
Sometimes one of our nerve cells

1074
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,340
Can go from here to here in the head

1075
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,540
that's pretty far

1076
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,980
whether it is far or near

1077
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:18,480
Each neuron can communicate with other neurons

1078
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,360
There can be up to 1000 contacts and 1000 links

1079
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,920
so you can miss our brain is a

1080
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,300
In terms of computer

1081
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,600
It is a place with a very dense network distribution

1082
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,960
Only in this way can our message delivery be quickly reached

1083
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,440
Let me give you an example

1084
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,040
That is to say, our human brain

1085
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:39,440
how to say

1086
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,540
That is, you want to be like

1087
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,680
How many buses are there in Taipei?

1088
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,420
We don't necessarily have 100 buses

1089
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,440
Then say this bus goes to this place

1090
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,820
that bus to that place

1091
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,520
Because the bus is so big

1092
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
so it gets stuck

1093
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,220
A better plan is

1094
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,860
Maybe we only need 30 buses or 40 buses

1095
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,920
But we have planned its route

1096
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
you can form a good network

1097
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Let you go to Taipei, all four-way and eight-way road

1098
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
but he is in his physical

1099
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
He really doesn't take too much risk in terms of size

1100
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
but rely on the Internet

1101
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I mean relative

1102
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Let's say we don't need

1103
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
don't say why you like

1104
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
But there needs to be a link between them

1105
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
well done

1106
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
this matter is more important

1107
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
there is another phenomenon

1108
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Maybe you don't know that well

1109
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It's a bit scary to hear it cold

1110
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
people from birth

1111
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Our nerve cells are dying

1112
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And once you die, you don't regenerate

1113
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Over 90% of the countries

1114
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Nerve cells in only a few areas

1115
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
will regenerate

1116
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And one of those areas is the seahorse ghost

1117
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
That's what I just said is responsible for the memory schedule

1118
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
then you will sound

1119
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
feel terrible

1120
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
In fact when a baby is born

1121
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
he is his neuron

1122
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
When the number of nerve cells in the brain is the largest

1123
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
But this baby may

1124
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
have they studied

1125
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So each of his nerve cells

1126
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Like other nerve cells

1127
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,740
Let's just give a simple example

1128
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,500
His link may only have 100 links

1129
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,900
but you can speak

1130
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,800
why a person seems like you feel

1131
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,700
he is the best years

1132
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,700
or when you think he's smart

1133
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,000
maybe thirty or forty years old

1134
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,100
or feel as if

1135
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,400
The end of life after middle age

1136
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Actually at that time

1137
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,900
The number of our nerve blood light has died a lot

1138
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,700
many people died

1139
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,500
but why do you feel

1140
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,600
People learn from experience and get smarter

1141
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,200
that reason is because

1142
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,900
Those who are still alive are different.

1143
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,400
What's the connection between them and other nerve blood lights?

1144
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,000
so a baby

1145
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,100
he may be this nerve blood light

1146
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,800
with another nerve blood light

1147
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,300
100 links

1148
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,100
but in adulthood

1149
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,700
to a mature stage

1150
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,600
Four or fifty years old

1151
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,500
he may be bloody

1152
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,100
can another bleed

1153
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,700
There are seven or eight hundred links

1154
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,200
so that link

1155
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
that network is important

1156
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,800
rather than exactly

1157
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,800
The number of cell bodies is important

1158
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
certainly

1159
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,900
neurohemophore

1160
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,800
Can't die indefinitely

1161
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,500
because we are aging

1162
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,000
The number of nerve blood light is always dying

1163
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,460
to a certain extent

1164
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,160
In fact, it is the time of processing caused by life

1165
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,260
This is normal aging and death

1166
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,300
so

1167
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,800
You sound like it's really scary

1168
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,000
And then as soon as you are born these cells are dying

1169
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,720
OK, then I'll just keep watching.

1170
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,760
How do we scientists do learning and memory experiments

1171
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,360
We can't just experiment with people

1172
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,860
neither one

1173
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,720
It's not ethical

1174
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,160
two no way

1175
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,760
Because human variables vary too much

1176
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,120
Everyone is very different

1177
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,960
We're looking for ten people at random

1178
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,420
The ten of us will have a lot

1179
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,560
There will be ten different reactions for the same number of times

1180
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,120
So animals actually provide a homogeneity and distance

1181
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,080
It's an experiment on animals that many of us do for the most part

1182
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:49,980
It's all small numbers

1183
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,460
They often prefer to use them for any experiment

1184
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,620
Any direction

1185
00:42:55,620 --> 00:43:00,080
This is mainly because Ren Lu is actually a very complicated idea.

1186
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Then his experimental results

1187
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It is also more applicable to human

1188
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
such as human dementia

1189
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
or something related to the Ashhan process

1190
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Because people also have this task

1191
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
chief of science

1192
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
It's all done on land.

1193
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
That is to say, this is called pole turning

1194
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
like this is twelve turns

1195
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
How do you guys do this experiment?

1196
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
At the beginning, let the mouse starve for a whole day

1197
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
he's going to be a little hungry

1198
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
That's why he wants to find food

1199
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
then it's hard

1200
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
These twelve turns

1201
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
360 degrees per turn

1202
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It's only 30 degrees apart

1203
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
30 degrees only

1204
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So this rat is hungry to learn how

1205
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
That is to say, the Chief of Science

1206
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
First time he put a food pellet here

1207
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
this mouse is hungry

1208
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
try many times

1209
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
As a result, he turned his eyes here

1210
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
he eats him

1211
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
The second time he had to learn

1212
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
our scientist

1213
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
can put this food here

1214
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
he has to learn to say

1215
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I'm going to turn 30 degrees to the right this time

1216
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
i can find food

1217
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Next time he will learn

1218
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
turn right another 30 degrees

1219
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
i find it hard to be honest

1220
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Even I can't tell

1221
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
so when later

1222
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,120
Then mouse of course you are smart

1223
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:01,960
How many times did he learn

1224
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,280
he ate three times

1225
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,480
eat a certain person

1226
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,600
he feels less hungry

1227
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,480
he started not to go

1228
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,600
but in the middle

1229
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,480
You will never be able to complete this experiment

1230
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,120
So in 1986 there was a scientific

1231
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,760
very smart

1232
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,120
His name is Ritramoris

1233
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,160
he is still there

1234
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,280
Shending Science Center at the University of Edinburgh

1235
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,200
Doubtsbury

1236
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,680
He thought of a way

1237
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,320
Just put the mouse in the water

1238
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,440
you can't believe it

1239
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,960
A mouse is not a real water animal

1240
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,520
but he can swim and think

1241
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,040
that this

1242
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,800
Behavioral pattern called Morris

1243
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,520
because its surname is Morris

1244
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,640
Do you know that westerners often do this

1245
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,440
what did you invent

1246
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,640
do it with your name

1247
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,200
that code name

1248
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:39,760
Mondown

1249
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,480
Ting Horton

1250
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,280
etc.

1251
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,480
So it's called Morris

1252
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,200
Spend every eschatological water already

1253
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:45,760
this pool

1254
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,760
That is, I am in Calefort or the night market

1255
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,960
buy that kid

1256
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,920
summer wash

1257
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,360
swimming pool

1258
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,360
Then he put water in this

1259
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,320
what about the water

1260
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,520
use some

1261
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,720
bleach or powdered milk

1262
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,400
make it slightly mushy

1263
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,760
So this time you put the mouse in

1264
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,400
it looks like

1265
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,300
Can't see anything in the water

1266
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,300
But in fact somewhere in this water

1267
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,700
it's just a little bit below

1268
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,300
if the water is here

1269
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,300
just below

1270
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,300
there is a table

1271
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,000
So if that mouse kicks kick kick

1272
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,300
have been to that place

1273
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,000
It will stand up when it kicks it

1274
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,200
Because it doesn't want to become drowned

1275
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,100
So that I do this lab

1276
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,000
I don't believe it either

1277
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,900
In my heart I'm afraid it will drown

1278
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,400
but its life

1279
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,500
sealed in water for the first time

1280
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,700
it will flow away

1281
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,200
So I think the human lab

1282
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,900
Sometimes some functions are similar to animals

1283
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,300
we're still a bit regressed

1284
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,700
if we go down maybe

1285
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,900
it won't work

1286
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,300
Then what is the important thing about this experiment

1287
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,000
when you sit in the water

1288
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,100
clean the walls

1289
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,800
you can't have any tricks like this

1290
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,100
in vain

1291
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,500
Then we put some signals on purpose

1292
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,400
with color

1293
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,800
Do not use the wrong shape

1294
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,500
because I don't know how to prove it

1295
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,700
I have never heard that mice have poor vision.

1296
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,200
it is a bit

1297
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,700
It seems to be a bit colored

1298
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,900
So we use the shape

1299
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,900
a round shape

1300
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,300
a square etc.

1301
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,700
natural often

1302
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,100
It didn't recognize this at first

1303
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,760
where is the platform

1304
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,560
But after several training

1305
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,800
he will watch these

1306
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,200
This picture looks like he is looking at it

1307
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,000
He will send these signals

1308
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,300
Like I just said there is a 7

1309
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,160
there's a gas station there

1310
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,500
so you know how to turn

1311
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,860
He will put the platform problem

1312
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,600
connect with some signals

1313
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,900
several times later

1314
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,600
He'll get on the platform in no time

1315
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,960
so the shorter the period the better

1316
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,760
we'll remember later

1317
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,860
time for him to escape

1318
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,860
because he said he'd get up soon

1319
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,900
There are also some teachers who really can't learn

1320
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,160
We have about 100 seconds and 120 seconds

1321
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,520
Then you have to pick him up when it's time

1322
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,560
switch to that table

1323
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,460
Otherwise you eventually

1324
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,660
he'll drown in the end

1325
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,160
so he stood up

1326
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,220
this

1327
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,360
This can be thought of by others

1328
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,160
you know from 1980 to now

1329
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,060
You go to see what kind of top journals like nature

1330
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:45,320
Many, many studies have been done using this method

1331
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,460
because what i just said

1332
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,160
he is a compulsive learner

1333
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,020
You can't force it on purpose

1334
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:51,720
the second

1335
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,060
Ren Lu's learning

1336
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,460
His many research results

1337
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,060
Can be applied to human dementia

1338
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,960
a study

1339
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,760
Some research and development

1340
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,200
it has its importance

1341
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,300
That's why I'm here to say

1342
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,300
This mouse learns how to swim

1343
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,400
Then

1344
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,600
this is this no sound

1345
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,100
It's okay, here's for you to see

1346
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,200
When doing real experiments

1347
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,100
how did they put the mouse down

1348
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,100
it swims there

1349
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,600
Then you will see the mouse a few red

1350
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,100
it's not red

1351
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,300
You see it swims like a cloud

1352
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,600
It's not red, it's because of the light reflection

1353
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,100
so you look like that red over there is a mouse

1354
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,500
I'll show you this time

1355
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,800
Really such an experimental operation

1356
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,900
how they operate

1357
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,300
this can be slower

1358
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,400
That's why the experimenter put the mouse down

1359
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
In fact, we can probably see

1360
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,900
Because I think Zheng Mao is stupid

1361
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,100
He just can't find where the platform is

1362
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,200
So he's been probably

1363
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,100
The number of seconds to have an upper limit for this experiment

1364
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,300
Then they often sometimes

1365
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,200
now there is

1366
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,800
Finally run to the middle

1367
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
still a little insecure

1368
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
This is how the experiment goes

1369
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yes, compare the water Mingjing experiment

1370
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
um , ok , that ' s it

1371
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
No, otherwise we will draw together

1372
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
it is this

1373
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
good

1374
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I also found this picture in an earlier textbook

1375
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
it compares

1376
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
rat brain

1377
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
one, untrained

1378
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
without e.g. studying and training a teacher

1379
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
with a trained teacher

1380
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
it goes better than his cerebral cortex

1381
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
cell, cellular

1382
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Density of axis plots, dendrograms

1383
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
here is trained

1384
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
here is no training

1385
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
can you see it

1386
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
A little bit of difference is the teacher here

1387
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
The density of connections of his branches

1388
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It will be less than here

1389
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
may not be so obvious

1390
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
but there is a difference

1391
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
why is it hard to be obvious

1392
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
If you only select one area to see

1393
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
may be comparable

1394
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
the reason is because

1395
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
very progressive animal

1396
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
It's very high, not an animal

1397
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,700
so stupid mouse

1398
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,800
Its brain is already very complicated

1399
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,600
so you

1400
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,900
Called Ceiling Effect C0E1 Block

1401
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,200
It's hard for you to move like this

1402
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,200
Then see a particularly obvious change

1403
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,700
Now scientists make time words

1404
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,200
will take out an area

1405
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,500
one by one area

1406
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,600
Different areas are better

1407
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,000
It will be a bit difficult for a large piece

1408
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,700
But this is a precious photo

1409
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,600
Because I talked about this later

1410
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,100
I don't think it's easy for you to see

1411
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,000
good

1412
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,700
You just saw the side view of this picture

1413
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,000
Now this picture is like this

1414
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,400
say i face you now

1415
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,700
This slice is cut like this

1416
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,600
from my head like this

1417
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,400
Cut back one by one like this

1418
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,000
So this is a full front section

1419
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,100
The full front area is very cut down

1420
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:39,800
I want to show everyone

1421
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,300
This is the area of ​​the seahorse ghost

1422
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,100
this whole rhythm

1423
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,500
It is very easy to dye just dye

1424
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,800
seahorse ghost area

1425
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,800
I just said that this area is in charge of our study

1426
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,000
with memory

1427
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,900
with learning and memory

1428
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,200
Especially this place related to the task

1429
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,100
That

1430
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,700
Especially related to the area of ​​C1

1431
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,900
don't talk so much

1432
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,000
then wait until you ask

1433
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,200
all the way back

1434
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,000
I'll cut to the back

1435
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
This area of ​​the hippocampus goes down slightly to the sides

1436
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
This is relatively front to back

1437
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
it goes down slightly to the sides

1438
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
So this is the area of ​​the hippocampus

1439
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And this place is what we call the Xinren River area

1440
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
so it's a bit on the bottom of the comparison

1441
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
At this time, we just take the medicine

1442
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
To be injected into this Xinrenhe area

1443
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Then look at the impact and change of the learning and memory of the mice

1444
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So these are sliced ​​graphs

1445
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I'll put one or two next

1446
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
A straight picture or two of that mouse brain

1447
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I miss you

1448
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
i asked them

1449
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
they feel ok

1450
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
i think i hope you feel okay

1451
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
but it feels good

1452
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
this is a mouse

1453
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
not a rat

1454
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
It's the guy you're like watching ghosts

1455
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
that cerebellum

1456
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
The situation where the brain is cut off

1457
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
so symmetrical

1458
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
This is just from the skull

1459
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Take it out after your neck and feet

1460
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
So these are the sides of the brain

1461
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
this is the cerebellum

1462
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
under it is the brain cover

1463
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
But there is no need to cut the back

1464
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
so just took it out

1465
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
There will be bone fluid blood vessel wind

1466
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,800
But then we put it in

1467
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,240
physiological experiment water

1468
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,160
Some of these blood vessels were taken away by fine water after clearing

1469
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,400
So this is another way after sucking up all the bloodshots

1470
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,960
so symmetrical

1471
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,600
if we

1472
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,440
Let me tell you where the hippocampus will be

1473
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,040
So if we start from this place

1474
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,440
We use a pinch to push the sides apart

1475
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,600
When you pull it out, you'll see it's like this inside

1476
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,560
This is where the two sides are pushed apart

1477
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,720
Spread it out again, just like that

1478
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,920
whole

1479
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,760
So these two areas are left-right symmetrical, which is the hippocampus area.

1480
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,520
it's obvious in this way

1481
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,160
Right in our hand and mouth are these two slices

1482
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,920
they say value the belt

1483
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,400
not sure

1484
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,960
This is the hippocampus area

1485
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,120
and then in this flipped area

1486
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,200
Let's talk about it

1487
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,200
This area is symmetrical to this area

1488
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,360
Stylistic

1489
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,360
This area is responsible for managing motor function

1490
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,200
You said that there are often patients with strokes or long streams

1491
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,440
he can't move his hands and feet

1492
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,960
often bleeding

1493
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,380
or a blood clot in this place

1494
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:02,620
it's a homeland security movement

1495
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,720
Manage wear, running, balance, and more

1496
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,540
all important

1497
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,760
That is, the Ministry of Homeland Security cannot

1498
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,380
This is the Department of Homeland Security's study of genetics

1499
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,220
Then in the name of the former Russian student

1500
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,380
jump it in for everyone to see

1501
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,620
That is, the hippocampus will be left-right symmetrical

1502
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,040
so you probably know

1503
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,020
It really uses the brain's gotta go

1504
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,180
probably where

1505
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,500
This is when we actually experiment

1506
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,660
do with pre-uncertainty

1507
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:27,420
This is the three-dimensional brain positioning shift between three-dimensional collisions

1508
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,780
We put the numbers on this shelf

1509
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,780
In fact, we saw the same thing in our hospital.

1510
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,560
The doctor also has to help us put it on a shelf like this

1511
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,360
That's it, it's a bit more severe

1512
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,360
Then we usually do mice

1513
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,160
Just ordinary glasses and a microscope

1514
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,780
But do doctors use an operating microscope?

1515
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,560
We will first put a tube

1516
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,640
in a specific area of ​​the rat's brain

1517
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,240
Then just wait for it to recover in a week

1518
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,800
we go through real barrel

1519
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,840
through very thin tubes

1520
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,880
Put this medicine slowly in its

1521
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,120
Inject it into the brain and put it in slowly

1522
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Doing the teacher's experiment, doing animal experiments is very hard

1523
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Each one has to go through such an operation

1524
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
The assumption is that there are some drugs

1525
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
we need him to go very slowly teacher

1526
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
import teacher

1527
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
And it requires him to give up slowly for a long time

1528
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
So we'll put these tubes in his head

1529
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And then these tubes will knock down

1530
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
look over here you can see those

1531
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Then knock down a needle and the whole thing goes to a pump

1532
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
We use the pump to control him

1533
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
micro-injection into the brain

1534
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
And then we'll measure it as behavior

1535
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
So here you may have a question

1536
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
That is, why do we experiment with mice?

1537
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
i just said

1538
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Because of course we can't experiment directly with people.

1539
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
But there are also important features

1540
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
you probably can't believe it

1541
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
We look very different from mice, don't we?

1542
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
we are totally different animals

1543
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
We are Qualitatively different

1544
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
It's not just that we don't have tails

1545
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
But the homology of the mouse brain

1546
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
One percent of our absolute brains

1547
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Our more than ninety homology

1548
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,840
I will say this to mean

1549
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,720
His brain is smaller than ours

1550
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,720
he has fewer neurons than us

1551
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,720
but the size of each neuron

1552
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,720
In fact, about the same as us

1553
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,000
We put in 25 to 30

1554
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
He's about 20 to 25 centimeters

1555
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
But what I just said about homology means that

1556
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,560
he's in his head

1557
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,000
Where are the nerve cells in the brain?

1558
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
What to do and what to do

1559
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
90% of the time we endure

1560
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
That nerve cell is also in charge of that function in that part of our brain

1561
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
this is not enough

1562
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
That 90% to 93%

1563
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
So you know the results of the mouse study

1564
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
many offer a

1565
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Because mice can reproduce in large numbers and there are many

1566
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
So in the mouse provides a

1567
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Basic data for a scientific study

1568
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Based on these data

1569
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
we may do it again

1570
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Be a dog, be a pig

1571
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Then step by step are optimistic

1572
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
be a monkey again

1573
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Then start the human

1574
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Prikling and Spirituality Tests

1575
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
so

1576
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Because in fact, the biomedical research at my old place is

1577
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,760
big now

1578
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,120
Based on the fact that our brains and brains are nine percent

1579
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,320
please

1580
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,200
ok , now i ' ll talk about forgetting a little bit

1581
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,520
Then start talking about the real evidence

1582
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,080
Scientists do less about forgetting

1583
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:25,040
Mainly forgetting is not so easy to do

1584
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,680
The other is the process of forgetting

1585
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,200
It's actually a little simpler

1586
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,520
That is, when your memory cannot be retrieved

1587
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,880
it is actually forgetting

1588
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,120
So let's study memory as an example.

1589
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,880
But for the study of forgetting

1590
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,920
The scientist's perception is

1591
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,240
It does not indicate memory loss

1592
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,800
where it just stand by

1593
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,560
I just didn't get called out by you

1594
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,840
this matter is very important

1595
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,680
It means you have learned one thing

1596
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,120
never learned from you

1597
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:49,920
you learned something

1598
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,480
you can't forget

1599
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,840
never learned from you

1600
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,840
are two things

1601
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,680
Wait a minute I'll show you an animation

1602
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,120
you have learned

1603
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,960
Your neural network connections

1604
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,920
will link up

1605
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,600
Then you have no way in the end and often can't remember

1606
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,640
because of your extraction process

1607
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,600
The ability to call him out of the hard drive deflection

1608
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,640
If you haven't learned anything at all

1609
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,200
His neural networks never formed

1610
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,800
So based on this our cognition and understanding of this

1611
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,320
In fact, everyone, especially young people, should try

1612
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,840
Of course you don't have to learn everything

1613
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
but you learned something

1614
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,240
Forget that you have never learned before

1615
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,360
Yes, the networked nature of the nervous system

1616
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,920
In terms of connectivity and full utilization

1617
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,240
Learning is basically good

1618
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,840
That can be explained like this

1619
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,080
Physician means that you have been genetically

1620
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,440
Those neural pathways and nerve protrusions are still there.

1621
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,960
he just wasn't sparked

1622
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:52,080
You'll have to wait until the proper stimulus comes along

1623
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,880
His gene was extracted

1624
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,880
Then this you forgot that decline theory, that's it

1625
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,700
Memories are just beginning to form

1626
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,700
strong at first

1627
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,380
but you don't remember it

1628
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,340
you don't extract it

1629
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,140
don't even remember it

1630
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,740
You slowly slowly this will disappear

1631
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,940
But if you often use it

1632
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,180
Rehearsal is to review again

1633
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,840
Practice and extract

1634
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,280
then this memory will come back

1635
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,340
So sometimes at a certain age

1636
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,080
a certain age

1637
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,340
more things to remember

1638
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,500
That is to say, it is always good to remember

1639
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,040
because you reactivate your neural pathways

1640
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,140
Of course we want to try to remember as much as possible

1641
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,680
happy things

1642
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,540
It's really important to remember this event

1643
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,080
but i just said

1644
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,480
actually forgotten

1645
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,540
Originally Uyghur Church

1646
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,440
Forgetting is also very important

1647
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,380
because we just talk

1648
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,340
Life is not as good as eight or nine at a time

1649
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,680
So in fact we humans are

1650
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,940
tend to forget things

1651
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,740
it's again once

1652
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,380
This is it

1653
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,080
It's a neuroprotective mechanism

1654
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,480
because we don't want to make ourselves

1655
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,220
often caught in that pleasant thing

1656
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,680
emotion and experience

1657
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,240
So oblivion is a very important reporter

1658
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,680
It's just that the first-class ones can't forget, so they can't forget

1659
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,840
Otherwise, it doesn't matter if you forget something

1660
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:16,080
Then the animation below tells us that

1661
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,720
he uses a

1662
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,360
That is to say, in fact, forgetting can be done less

1663
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,720
Just because something went wrong with the extraction process

1664
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,240
He has no problem forming

1665
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,360
he is still there

1666
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,760
after that neural pathway

1667
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,200
Because in the beginning he will have a few footprints running on his mind

1668
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,320
What he means is that when you are learning something

1669
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,960
That way will pass and you will form a memory

1670
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,960
Then there seems to be a high-speed road like mine

1671
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,840
It's very smooth to play in all directions

1672
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,240
But if you forget later

1673
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,160
That road seems to be closed

1674
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,960
just like different venues

1675
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,760
He is hoped that education will often use some very

1676
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,080
Very deep animation as an example

1677
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,080
Then let beginners this will be more of a

1678
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,040
good spirituality

1679
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
so everyone can ring the bell

1680
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Didn't get to this point

1681
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
so he just told us

1682
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
words that have been learning

1683
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
that way is usually

1684
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
you forget it's just the way

1685
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
not usually

1686
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
but it still exists

1687
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
So it's good to learn more

1688
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
and

1689
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Old age should be like this

1690
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I'll give you some more data later

1691
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
tell us everybody is saying

1692
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
no matter live to old age

1693
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
It is actually very useful to learn the old saying

1694
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
what factors are there now

1695
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
affect the formation of our memories

1696
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Then this is the early research

1697
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
but i started last year

1698
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
When the annual scientific meeting is approved

1699
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Found this research and came back

1700
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
there are many

1701
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Sleep is actually the formation of our memories

1702
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
a great help

1703
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
In the past three days, I just cite these representative

1704
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Like both sides are very good journals

1705
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
tell us that

1706
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
If Guodu sleeps

1707
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
deprivation of sleep

1708
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
affect memory formation

1709
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
affect memory formation

1710
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
let affect memory formation

1711
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,760
It will affect the pain road formed

1712
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,360
So it's really a good way to learn

1713
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,400
just the way you remember

1714
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,840
after you learn one thing

1715
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,640
if you let your nerve cells

1716
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,360
if you have enough rest

1717
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,320
actually you will remember this

1718
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,560
remember best

1719
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:20,840
learn to keep in mind

1720
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,400
In psychology there's something called the Interference Theory

1721
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,560
Let's interview this theory

1722
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,880
What I hate the most is what you are learning now

1723
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,320
You haven't solidified these neurons yet

1724
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,200
We are talking about Hab and Consolidation theory

1725
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,200
haven't made it solid yet

1726
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,280
you go to learn the next one

1727
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,480
After learning A, learn B

1728
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,400
B has not yet consolidated

1729
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,160
A is not consolidated yet

1730
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,440
You go to learn C again

1731
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,040
This is the worst in terms of long-term memory

1732
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,440
But I don't want when I was a student

1733
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,720
This is the most used

1734
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:44,640
here small is by english

1735
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,920
The next elementary school is to do some math

1736
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,200
Then by Guowen, right?

1737
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,400
I can't remember anything

1738
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:50,080
but it's okay

1739
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,280
That's useful for coming here for the exam

1740
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,880
because we were originally

1741
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,120
just want it to go further in the short term

1742
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,480
You just pass the exam

1743
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,440
But interviews are better than long-term memory

1744
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,560
this is not good

1745
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,740
You're really serious about making it stand in long term memory

1746
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:04,340
you should learn later

1747
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:06,500
rest or sleep

1748
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,180
let those nerve cells

1749
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:10,740
Repeatedly can form a pathway loop

1750
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,060
and then allow it to form long-term memory

1751
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,140
That

1752
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:18,820
Yes, I know a lot of people have this insomnia problem

1753
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:20,560
I would feel

1754
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,820
sleep is really important

1755
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:23,820
So if you really have serious insomnia problems

1756
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:26,500
I think it's time to go to the doctor and prescribe some medicine.

1757
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,200
i have friends to eat

1758
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,700
I've been taking this insomnia pill for 20 years

1759
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,400
I think it's okay too

1760
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,600
you don't see any very bad effects

1761
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,340
Because you can at least help you after you take the medicine

1762
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,200
Don't even think about sleeping for seven or eight hours

1763
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,700
at least this medicine may help

1764
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:42,600
Might be able to help a person sleep more than four hours

1765
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,640
get a good four hours of sleep

1766
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,440
I can't sleep with you drenched

1767
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,080
much worse

1768
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,120
Because we sleep a lot in four hours

1769
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,620
Wave cycle

1770
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,020
means you sleep for four hours

1771
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,080
you are basically a sleeper

1772
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,620
Let's talk about the complete cycle

1773
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,540
This is actually very important

1774
01:02:58,540 --> 01:02:59,980
so i think

1775
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,600
There are some medicines that are so effective

1776
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,400
because sleep is more important

1777
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,000
So you can take that bad effect of the medicine

1778
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,200
I think it can be put second

1779
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,200
You know that report I don't know where he's watching

1780
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,200
Most used medicine in the world

1781
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,400
It's like a drug for insomnia

1782
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,800
only high blood pressure

1783
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,000
Only what cholesterol medicine

1784
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
So people with insomnia all over the world will ask me how much

1785
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
and depression

1786
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,200
This is also a bit troublesome

1787
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,400
Let's wait until we get to parenchyma

1788
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,600
let's talk a little about depression

1789
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,400
ok this is sleep

1790
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,800
Because what I'm citing you are all about the age of science

1791
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,800
research report

1792
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,800
i'm not...

1793
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:32,800
I have no ill intentions

1794
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,800
I said that when you usually look for this car, it becomes oppressive.

1795
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,200
and then you just take it

1796
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,200
not necessarily so

1797
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,200
you just look at where that one came from

1798
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,800
The source of those news

1799
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,600
If it is really a report of scientific research

1800
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,600
Where is the word

1801
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,200
you are more inclined to believe

1802
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,400
one more important thing

1803
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,000
This is something we can control

1804
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
is sports

1805
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,600
This was done as early as 1990

1806
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,400
Exercise can help boost memory

1807
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,200
so good thing this is us

1808
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,800
that we can control

1809
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Then exercise can cause some catastrophes of nerve blood hair

1810
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
We finally have a very important neurotrophic factor

1811
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
neurotrophic factor

1812
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
It translates into brain circle neurotrophic factor in Chinese

1813
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Randy Rive Neutropic Better

1814
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Experiments in mice tell us

1815
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
This is a big white horse that has not been exercised

1816
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
This is the weather for rats to exercise

1817
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Activities such as running rollers, etc.

1818
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
After the weather

1819
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
It uses a special developer

1820
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Let you see that is the red part

1821
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
orange part

1822
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
It's this VDN, the neurotrophic factor

1823
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
new place

1824
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
this thing is very important

1825
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
It's not just about our learning genes

1826
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
It is related to the protection of neurodegenerative diseases

1827
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
but you can't eat it

1828
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
you can't buy any of this

1829
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
it can't synthesize

1830
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And it's useless if you eat it

1831
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
It's impenetrable to what we call cerebrovascular barriers

1832
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
so what you put in your mouth

1833
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
out of my mind

1834
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Our nerve blood hair will synthesize itself

1835
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
so you just have enough

1836
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,720
Basic Cellular Drugs

1837
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:02,760
protein fat

1838
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,120
carb throat

1839
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,240
minerals blah blah blah

1840
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,400
as long as you have

1841
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:07,400
these should have things

1842
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,440
our nerve cells

1843
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,640
will make

1844
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,560
BDF comes

1845
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,920
these good things come

1846
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,720
But if you go to exercise today

1847
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:14,240
you can see

1848
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,640
this thing will increase

1849
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:17,360
so this is

1850
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,520
The published natural

1851
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:19,520
natural difference

1852
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:20,480
no tell everyone

1853
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,640
In fact, as early as 695

1854
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,920
there are such reports

1855
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:23,960
so

1856
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,200
Everyone wants to let their learning

1857
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,120
good with skills

1858
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,920
just wait and listen

1859
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,320
Can't find it, go for a run

1860
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,600
that video is

1861
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,360
look

1862
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,200
let you see

1863
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,200
How can I be

1864
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,400
neurotrophic factor

1865
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,960
nerve growth factor

1866
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,760
added to the cells

1867
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:43,960
look at this cell

1868
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:44,680
long case

1869
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,080
It is different from not adding water

1870
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,840
Wait a minute, the screen will be cut like this

1871
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,600
There is no addition in the lower left corner

1872
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,640
There is a plus in the upper right corner

1873
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,720
so give you some

1874
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:53,920
real evidence

1875
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,600
The substance was added to the neurons on the right.

1876
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:06,000
Axons are growing rapidly.

1877
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Restoration of brain function begins with this new growth.

1878
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,000
Some researchers speculate that nerve growth factor

1879
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
helps account for the flexible wiring in the brain.

1880
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
A site like this,

1881
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
neurons sprouting fibers and establishing new connections.

1882
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:32,000
Dismetals are previous notions about the brain's stepping

1883
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
and hard-wired character.

1884
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Sorry, she's completely in English

1885
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,760
Because her class is in English

1886
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,260
That is to say, emotions can affect our learning

1887
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:08,260
What she said was

1888
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:10,260
We learn best when we are...

1889
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:11,420
We...

1890
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,660
Go...

1891
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,760
When we are...

1892
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,120
just go and dance

1893
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:19,760
right

1894
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:20,720
that is

1895
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,920
Excuse me, this word is wrong by comp'ing pace

1896
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:23,720
that is

1897
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,320
Tell Reel when we are happy

1898
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,200
When we are happy and reel nice

1899
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,200
I'll fix it now

1900
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,760
Otherwise you are too serious

1901
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,880
我們Learn best when we are...

1902
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,080
when we are...

1903
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,560
a bit hot

1904
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,680
We don't think we're stressed either

1905
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:47,960
she told us

1906
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,080
when we are in a happy

1907
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,080
when in a relaxed situation

1908
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,480
Our ability to learn is the best

1909
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,760
So everyone has to find a way

1910
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,020
tell myself

1911
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,720
You have to learn in this situation like this

1912
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,520
If you really are that day

1913
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,320
very upset very frustrated

1914
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,000
very bad mood very angry

1915
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
you don't go

1916
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,200
Because it may be a waste of time to learn

1917
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,400
just go change it

1918
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,800
What is the effect of learning so poorly?

1919
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,200
is when a person is anxious

1920
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,200
It's really hard to learn when you're under a lot of pressure

1921
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,000
So you don't want to learn at this time

1922
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
How to learn at the same time

1923
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,200
adjust this pressure

1924
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,500
This is the unlearned chapter of neurohistory for psychologists

1925
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,000
I am now a comprehensive bad picture

1926
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,500
Talk about a situation of stress and study

1927
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,700
we are

1928
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:33,500
degree of stress

1929
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,000
when we are under no pressure

1930
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,700
In fact, our ability to learn is not good

1931
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,500
moderate pressure

1932
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,200
Human competition is always sympathy

1933
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,400
same power

1934
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,800
so take it slow

1935
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,500
when slowly increasing

1936
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:47,300
to a degree

1937
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,700
is our ability to learn

1938
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,600
at your best

1939
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,300
But after this

1940
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,200
will come down again

1941
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,200
I think everyone will agree with this picture

1942
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,100
You're thinking of all the countries you've studied a lot

1943
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,100
so we

1944
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,600
We must let ourselves that pressure

1945
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,760
the best place to be

1946
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,340
give us moderate pressure

1947
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,340
but not big

1948
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:08,560
Because this is the domain of psychiatry

1949
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,500
A lot of stress can lead to depression

1950
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,180
So we figured out that

1951
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:14,500
Let us learn with such giri

1952
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,500
But let's not let ourselves be in

1953
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,420
Study without stress

1954
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,420
Because what you learn will be of no use

1955
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:22,220
Everyone, you will talk later

1956
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:23,720
We have nothing to do with people

1957
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:27,840
Our human genes have more than 99.5% homology

1958
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:28,620
no bladder

1959
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:29,940
we are very close people

1960
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:34,660
But the tolerance of each of us to stress

1961
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:36,740
or how we look at the same stimulus

1962
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:39,060
The same stimulus teaches different pressures to different people

1963
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:40,500
Everyone disagrees with this

1964
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,300
So there might be an individual

1965
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,700
It's stimulating all the time like this

1966
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:45,540
it's so low pressure

1967
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:46,340
then slowly

1968
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:47,900
So when the stimulus increases

1969
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,140
it pressures up

1970
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,940
It's just that the pressure has been so great

1971
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:52,780
it's bad if it goes on

1972
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:56,260
But some people may be equally stimulated

1973
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:57,220
This stimulation must be so strong

1974
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:58,580
He felt the pressure

1975
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:00,100
then stimulate even there

1976
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,880
he might as well

1977
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,380
In addition to individual participation

1978
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:05,200
Because in fact individual participation is

1979
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:05,800
is hard to tune

1980
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,580
you can't make yourself into someone else

1981
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:08,840
you will not be equal to him

1982
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:11,080
but i think we

1983
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,280
little of these relationships

1984
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,040
One thing to learn is

1985
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,580
you adjust yourself

1986
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,200
you let this thrill

1987
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,940
It would have been such a little stimulation

1988
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:21,240
stimulus like this

1989
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,240
The stimulation in the medium will make you so stressed

1990
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,780
You try to move this curve to the right

1991
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:27,140
adjust yourself

1992
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,540
through their own education

1993
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:31,480
or remind yourself

1994
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,180
accumulation of experience, etc.

1995
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:35,840
you make you the same stimulus

1996
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,220
The pressure he generates is only so low

1997
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:42,420
This is what we need for a healthy life

1998
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:43,020
talk button

1999
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:44,020
just with

2000
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:47,280
To resist pressure and external

2001
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,980
all sorts of things out of control

2002
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,940
say we tried it ourselves

2003
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,840
to do this kind of adjustment

2004
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,740
Actually this is really

2005
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:55,120
You are

2006
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,840
There is no way to teach this

2007
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,420
to teach

2008
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,440
but

2009
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,840
you know the pressure right

2010
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,300
learning team memory

2011
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:02,960
bad about many things

2012
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,800
we try to do something like this

2013
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,300
well , our last half hour

2014
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,900
Let's talk about Hayworth

2015
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,300
We just talked about the topic "Lions Formation"

2016
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,700
"Lions" is a collective term

2017
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,900
Azhewar formation is inside the lion formation

2018
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,000
the most proportion of the most

2019
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,700
It translates "Azihaiwo Formation" in English

2020
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,000
or the most common one

2021
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,500
There are estimated to be Alzheimer's patients worldwide

2022
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,700
30 million people

2023
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,300
Actually this is

2024
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,400
a little bit

2025
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,900
only underestimate not overestimate

2026
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:32,700
because some people

2027
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,100
especially likely in a certain area of ​​cultural science and technology medicine

2028
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,800
He's not going to see a doctor

2029
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,000
So there are still some underestimated possibilities

2030
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,700
But with technological civilization

2031
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,300
Advances in medicine are really commanded to prolong

2032
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,700
In fact, the population is increasing

2033
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,300
but there is a

2034
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:51,600
One thing might be better

2035
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,500
It has nothing to do with genetics

2036
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,000
Ninety percent of the patients we see

2037
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:57,800
Azhewar's Trouble

2038
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,700
it is last come

2039
01:11:58,700 --> 01:11:59,900
it is the key factor

2040
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,520
non-genetic factors

2041
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,520
Sportradiq speaks like this in English

2042
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,720
Only less than 10% of patients are genetic

2043
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:11,840
It's if the people who are in the family have hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen

2044
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,040
he has a better chance

2045
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,040
But such a population is relatively small

2046
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:21,120
Genetic factors compared patients with a large distinction under

2047
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,620
He had an early onset

2048
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:25,120
Sometimes the 50s start

2049
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:29,240
This is a characteristic of patients with genetically

2050
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,680
Then clinically tell us

2051
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,680
From the time the patient is symptomatic

2052
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,000
just can't remember things he can't remember

2053
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,840
He has been confirmed to be symptomatic by a doctor since he had symptoms

2054
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,840
He usually lives 8 to 20 years

2055
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,340
this range is very large

2056
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:43,340
On the one hand, individual differences

2057
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:46,040
Then after a person is diagnosed

2058
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:51,480
His progression is the evolution of this stage of the disease

2059
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,200
Some people evolve quickly and some people don't

2060
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,200
And every time a patient goes to see a doctor

2061
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,320
His degree is different

2062
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,320
Some people are very slight, some people are very strong

2063
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
is it serious

2064
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Then why do you say often

2065
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
For example, to see a doctor for a doctor's diagnosis

2066
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
that's what's wrong with saying

2067
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Usually the nerve cells die

2068
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
can't regenerate

2069
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
we just talked

2070
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
So actually

2071
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
what the doctor can handle

2072
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
just let the course

2073
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
slow down

2074
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Actually there is no way

2075
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
no way

2076
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
let that cell grow back

2077
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
That's usually when you see symptoms occur

2078
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
At this time, I have a stomachache in my head

2079
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
It's like yelling at these people for kneeling

2080
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
or big old sebum

2081
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
30% of the nerve cells have died

2082
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Only then will there be symptoms

2083
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
then you will feel

2084
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
why doesn't it just die

2085
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
5% have symptoms

2086
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
that way

2087
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
not just us

2088
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
We could have caught it early

2089
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
so our nerve cells

2090
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
is a feature

2091
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
they are very united

2092
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
as a nerve cell

2093
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
or when a few nerve cells are injured

2094
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
in these nerve cells

2095
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
nearby nerve cells

2096
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
will rush past

2097
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
share the function of this nerve cell

2098
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
so what is it supposed to do

2099
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Its neighbors will help it do this

2100
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
So each neuron will do 10% more

2101
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
do more do more

2102
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
just take what he should do

2103
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
just did it

2104
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
But wait until these surrounding nerve cells

2105
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
can't reproduce

2106
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
he is so tired

2107
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
worn out

2108
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
When I can't copy myself

2109
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Symptoms will appear at this time

2110
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
It is because our nerve cells have such characteristics

2111
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
So think about us humans really

2112
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Should learn from our neurocytology

2113
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
This is why we doctors see symptoms and say

2114
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
it's too late

2115
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
what risk factor does he have

2116
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
because i really really am not a doctor

2117
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
so i have to be conservative

2118
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I'm just summarizing some results for you

2119
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
from danger we know

2120
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
A real risk factor for Azheyor

2121
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
The first is aging

2122
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
His agreement is very high

2123
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
there is no way

2124
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
hidden by aging

2125
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
It's the neurons that are dying

2126
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
So your chances increase

2127
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
because you can use neurons

2128
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
no more

2129
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
because a nerve cell

2130
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Everyone has 1000 years

2131
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,080
Once he dies, he won't have the thousand yuan.

2132
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,380
this is the case

2133
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:05,880
Then let's leave him alone

2134
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,880
Because I have no one in the middle who can fight aging

2135
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,540
there is something else

2136
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:12,840
Exercise helps you sleep better

2137
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
make you feel better

2138
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:15,460
reduce stress and more

2139
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:17,000
Another is oxidative stress

2140
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,880
We just said that Xie Baoli is constantly oxidizing and reducing

2141
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,200
oxidative buffers that work

2142
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,160
there are things like stimulation

2143
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,000
There are some stimuli such as stress, etc.

2144
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,880
make our body produce

2145
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,460
autooxidative stress

2146
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:31,460
But it's already called free radicals for farmers

2147
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:32,420
Free-reduce

2148
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:34,220
it is some very unstable atoms

2149
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:35,220
so it's annoying

2150
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:37,420
When the oxidative stress is too high

2151
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,220
produce more free radicals

2152
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:40,860
These free radicals make our cells

2153
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:42,920
Watch cells pour out of colliding cells inside

2154
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,920
Then it will burst our cell nest

2155
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,340
Then finally let's what

2156
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,540
Cuboids also break

2157
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:49,180
Then let's get into the cell reasonably

2158
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:50,880
Let's break DNA

2159
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,540
So it makes these cells what

2160
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:55,380
So find ways to reduce oxidative stress

2161
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:58,020
is also very important

2162
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,480
In addition, genetic mutation

2163
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:00,140
this too

2164
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Too...

2165
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
what do we know about mental mutations

2166
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
but we can't

2167
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
There is no way to control our teacher

2168
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
which elites mutate

2169
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
This elite mutation is too much trouble

2170
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
it's not just dementia

2171
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Cancer, cancer is a very important factor

2172
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Also an elite mutant

2173
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Then another hypothesis is that nerve inflammation

2174
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
because we know that nerve cells

2175
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
between nerve cells

2176
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
In fact, there are some microglial cells

2177
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Those cells release some inflammatory factors

2178
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
So one hypothesis is that nerve cells

2179
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Inflammation of nerve cells can cause

2180
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
is a factor in dementia

2181
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
The other one is definitely a brain injury

2182
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Whether internal or external

2183
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
like you are swollen

2184
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
or hit outside, car or whatever

2185
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
after a brain injury

2186
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Nerve cells die

2187
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
with degeneration and atrophy

2188
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
so of course

2189
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
For more than just dementia

2190
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
For many diseases of neurons

2191
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
it's all about brain injury

2192
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
So after rehab or a brain injury

2193
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I want to study here to learn more

2194
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
something with memories

2195
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,740
You rewire your neural network

2196
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:05,240
this matter is very important

2197
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,260
but there are other

2198
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:07,760
known or unknown factors

2199
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,600
The patient who was needled overseas in Az

2200
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,500
How does the doctor judge

2201
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,300
very simple

2202
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:13,340
this disease is very troublesome

2203
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,100
But he has only two very important characteristics

2204
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:16,300
I'll show you later

2205
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,000
Positive cancer in this patient

2206
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,900
Because we shouldn't have plaques on our brains

2207
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,340
But the patients who received injections overseas in Az

2208
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:24,740
There are some weird plaques on the brain

2209
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,100
Then this plaque dominates the nerve

2210
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,700
transfer of information to and from nerves

2211
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
one is

2212
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,660
create some tangles of nerve fibers in there

2213
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:35,160
like line

2214
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,960
A lot of lines will form a ball like this

2215
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,960
Nerve fibrillary tangles are primarily a

2216
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,700
Tao's protein

2217
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,460
it's annoying

2218
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:43,160
Then show everyone

2219
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,760
A soap called A

2220
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,160
These are the two proteins that shouldn't be there

2221
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,000
Or he shouldn't have so many

2222
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,300
once got

2223
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:52,400
will find a fault

2224
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,000
this

2225
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:53,600
tell you if you lie

2226
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,960
This is the plaque

2227
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,360
you can see normal cells

2228
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,800
neurovascular bladder

2229
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,060
it's clean

2230
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,360
That kind of micro-selling is clear

2231
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:05,340
But something like this is from an Alzheimer's patient

2232
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:08,000
Keeping the collar like this schematic

2233
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,540
This is not the whole, this is a schematic

2234
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:11,160
this plaque

2235
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,040
But it's also plaque, it shouldn't be here

2236
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:16,340
but it blocks the connection between the neurohemocoel and the neurohemocoel

2237
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:19,340
This is the result of our own time

2238
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:22,780
We intentionally made this

2239
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:25,580
The chemical that forms the plaque

2240
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:28,320
This drug, it deliberately hits the brain of the mouse

2241
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:31,180
After a while, break, encounter a

2242
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:32,420
it forms these plaques

2243
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:34,280
This is the photo on the poster

2244
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,720
Because I'm afraid that the poster has this copyright, what's the problem

2245
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,160
so I usually use

2246
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,960
I experimented with this result myself to make this poster

2247
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,560
I'm afraid that the poster will follow later

2248
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:44,160
Westerners see what they say is this copyright

2249
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,360
So certify this rat brain here

2250
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:47,560
should be clean

2251
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,800
But these plaques

2252
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,800
So you're saying that the mouse experiment is still helpful.

2253
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,760
because it can

2254
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:57,840
A tool that provides us with some basic research

2255
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,960
This is another experimental picture, you can see the normal

2256
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,500
Nerve cells look like this

2257
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:03,900
Then another Azhai man becomes a cell

2258
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:05,260
it will have these plaques

2259
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:07,000
This is between cells

2260
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,000
And inside the cell it has these tangles

2261
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:09,660
did you see

2262
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:11,900
These entanglements are annoying

2263
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:14,500
It ends up making our skeleton protein

2264
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:16,660
Today the protein is disintegrated from it one by one

2265
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,460
disintegrate, disintegrate

2266
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:21,660
In the end, of course, this nerve cell can't survive.

2267
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:24,060
this is another image

2268
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:24,720
plaque

2269
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:25,700
These are the kinks

2270
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,500
You can see it's like some balls of string

2271
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:28,860
together

2272
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Where did those plaques come from?

2273
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,160
I'm speaking very simply

2274
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,320
don't look at these

2275
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,000
There's a protein in the back of our brain called this

2276
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,160
APP for short

2277
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,820
It is cleaved by some enzymes

2278
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,200
it will generate this thing

2279
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,500
There are 42 amino acids

2280
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:44,160
It's called A-beta 42

2281
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,500
this thing is disgusting too

2282
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:48,660
It accumulates and causes Alzheimer's disease

2283
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:50,160
Then you say why it accumulates

2284
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,320
We normal people also have this protein

2285
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:53,720
will also factor out this

2286
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:54,960
Just the words of us normal people

2287
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,120
It will have a normal data metabolized

2288
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:58,800
But in Alzheimer's patients

2289
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,920
just maybe

2290
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,840
Something went wrong with some metabolic pathways

2291
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,520
and aging

2292
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:07,000
There are some other questions that I don't know

2293
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,320
factors such as genetic pathways

2294
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:12,240
These people are more likely to accumulate this protein

2295
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,880
It is the protein that will cause these methods

2296
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,280
this is a normal cell

2297
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,320
This is a dying cell

2298
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,880
So the branches are not

2299
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,560
Then slowly the cells will shrink

2300
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:27,360
This is where we live in my actual life

2301
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:31,200
The big old white rat Hua did this cell staining

2302
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,320
can see me this is under control

2303
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,920
you see every blue

2304
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,760
whole normal nerve cells

2305
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,360
But if we give

2306
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:40,480
This fast-growing drug

2307
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,360
14 days to a month later

2308
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:45,520
You can see that these neurons are

2309
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,640
My cell shape is a little different

2310
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,600
This is the real experimental result

2311
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,520
not only people

2312
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,720
rats

2313
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:56,080
Then there will be problems with water

2314
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:59,040
So why is it called Alzheimer's disease?

2315
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
this sick person

2316
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,700
a german doctor

2317
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,600
His last name is Axel here again

2318
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,500
so what's your last name

2319
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:07,900
The one with the crown at the end

2320
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,000
so hurry up young people

2321
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,700
just try to invent something

2322
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:11,600
that thing will always be

2323
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,000
Carry's name

2324
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:13,900
Carry down

2325
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:16,200
His name is Alois Arzheimer

2326
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,100
he's the guy on the cover

2327
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:20,600
This is the man on the cover poster

2328
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,500
He's a neuropathologist in Germany

2329
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,800
with a psychiatrist

2330
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,300
When he was in 1906

2331
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:28,900
The first time I saw a patient

2332
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:30,400
Is there a fine AZ poster certificate

2333
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,400
so the last name

2334
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,800
In the end, he used his surname to represent the name.

2335
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,000
Just say this scientist is a pity

2336
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
He only lived to be 51 years old

2337
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,200
since the 19th century

2338
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,900
Some of this medical development can't be compared

2339
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,200
He only lived to be 51 years old

2340
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:49,400
This is what he carried the patient he described

2341
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,700
I believe this is agree

2342
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,300
He or his family agrees

2343
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:53,900
because you are in the textbook

2344
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:55,400
what on youtube

2345
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,200
Pay-per-tum will see this man

2346
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,900
So of course there is no copyright issue

2347
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
This person is a woman he diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease

2348
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
but he may be premature

2349
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Because he can't get out when he dies

2350
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
but unfortunately

2351
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Did the doctor die before him?

2352
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Because doctors aren't Alzheimer's

2353
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
That is to say, this may be premature

2354
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
this age

2355
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Assuming that in general

2356
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Usually in the 70s

2357
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
why the later time

2358
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Here are a few images for you to see

2359
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
A normal brain and an Alzheimer's brain

2360
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
what is the difference

2361
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
We can see that this is a normal human brain

2362
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
wrinkled a lot

2363
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
The Alzheimer's brain

2364
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
You can see not only the entire tail of the brain

2365
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
shrink smaller

2366
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
His wrinkled ruler lessened

2367
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Then his ditch became big

2368
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
The whole becomes smaller

2369
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Then make this face straight

2370
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
This is a normal human brain

2371
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
you just see this yellow place

2372
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
That is, he is using energy

2373
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
GoCos

2374
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
He is the one that can reflect the activity of cells

2375
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
So the more yellow

2376
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
This is when the nerve cells are more active

2377
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
But you look at a patient with Asperger's disease

2378
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Not only did his brain become smaller

2379
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
He has yellow, red

2380
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
There are fewer orange places

2381
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
So the amount of activity in his entire brain

2382
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
activity is very low

2383
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Of course you'd say it's obvious

2384
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
right? it's obvious

2385
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
But it's all about guiding people with Asthympiasis

2386
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
It will be so obvious at a very late stage

2387
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Here is another picture

2388
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
You can see here is the brain of a normal person

2389
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
This is an advance

2390
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
already serious

2391
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Asperger's disease patients

2392
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
The whole atrophy

2393
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
And the brain gets bigger

2394
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I'll get to that later

2395
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
This is also a pointing photo

2396
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Yellow-orange areas are active

2397
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
so normal people like this

2398
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
But the words of an asperger's disease patient

2399
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
The orange-yellow area is noticeably smaller overall

2400
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
So the whole amount of activity in his brain

2401
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
is getting lower

2402
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Here is another picture

2403
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Tell you about the shrinking of your brain

2404
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
this is the patient

2405
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
this is normal

2406
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
so the whole thing gets smaller

2407
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
then throw it down

2408
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
mad dog grows bigger

2409
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
then this is even scarier

2410
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,240
this is our ventricle

2411
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:02,640
We have two lateral ventricles

2412
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,520
There's also a third ventricle here

2413
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,340
it is empty

2414
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:06,640
it has no nerve cells

2415
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:08,320
Cerebral spine will be here at will

2416
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,520
it goes from here to our spine

2417
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,180
So the doctor sometimes goes to the hospital to check

2418
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:13,440
need brain pumping random

2419
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,660
It doesn't follow the brain here

2420
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:15,860
it will jerk down the spine

2421
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:17,260
But it's all tied together

2422
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,860
down the spine

2423
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:20,660
but look

2424
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:22,060
The words of this sea membrane disease patient

2425
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:23,560
its brain is so big

2426
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:24,860
it has no cells

2427
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:26,060
it's all empty

2428
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:27,340
This is the third ventricle

2429
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:29,560
This is really a serious trans-morbidity

2430
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,960
this is brain rot

2431
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,560
This is another image

2432
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,100
can see

2433
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:35,900
You can see the spine with enlarged ventricles

2434
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,360
compared to normal

2435
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:40,140
is very serious

2436
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:40,900
as you say

2437
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,640
Could this be used as an early

2438
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:43,940
diagnostic goals

2439
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:45,600
Of course I may have to ask the doctor for the answer

2440
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,440
But I think in the early days

2441
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,180
is not easy to see

2442
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:49,980
if not

2443
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:52,020
not even

2444
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:53,380
National students are often

2445
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:54,780
It's the late stage of Big Red

2446
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:57,520
Only the doctor can see

2447
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,660
That was the early days abroad

2448
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,020
Believe I made this

2449
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Anyway, it should be National Taiwan University

2450
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:02,960
I think it was put up by National Taiwan University Hospital.

2451
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,440
A shrinking brain on the web

2452
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,400
Still a patient of Haiwen

2453
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,120
with a normal human brain continues to grow

2454
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,040
this is simpler

2455
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,360
This CT is OK

2456
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:10,960
The brain keeps growing

2457
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,120
There is no need to do any complicated way

2458
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:14,880
That's the one

2459
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,000
that is

2460
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,400
Licensed shape

2461
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,720
Or the PAD may not need that

2462
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,520
It can be seen from continuous achievement

2463
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:23,400
but of course it

2464
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:24,280
This is also relatively late

2465
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:24,640
you can see

2466
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:25,760
normal human brain is so small

2467
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,600
it's so big here

2468
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:27,720
normal people like this

2469
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,000
Its brain is so big

2470
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,800
simply speaking

2471
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,200
clinical diagnosis

2472
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,200
broken from computer

2473
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,480
The following phenomena can be seen

2474
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:37,880
one is positive

2475
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,640
Then the hook widens

2476
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,000
so neurons

2477
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:41,760
atrophy

2478
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,600
Brain atrophy

2479
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,040
then pinch first

2480
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:44,720
this place

2481
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:45,520
side view

2482
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:46,560
we just

2483
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,600
not in the head

2484
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,200
Orthocephalic

2485
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,040
not behind

2486
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:50,960
Because these places on the side

2487
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:51,720
is what we say

2488
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,040
pay back

2489
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:53,920
performance lock

2490
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:54,840
loaded some regions

2491
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,880
then this will not help

2492
01:25:58,880 --> 01:25:59,480
no

2493
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,840
Our Cosmic Caretaker Gives Our Human Nervous System

2494
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:07,000
great potential and plasticity

2495
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,080
great potential

2496
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,080
but we regret that

2497
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,280
we humans

2498
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:14,280
We have 80 billion brain nervous systems

2499
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:15,160
i just said

2500
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:18,760
But we may not even use a tenth of it in our lifetime

2501
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,760
It's a pity

2502
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,760
Because why especially after a professionalized society

2503
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,260
We're all trying to do the same thing

2504
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:28,260
readers every day

2505
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:29,260
we are reading

2506
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:31,260
Athletic people are desperately exercising

2507
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,260
we have a group

2508
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:33,260
There are many groups of cells

2509
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:35,260
It's what we don't usually use

2510
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:39,260
then let's make the most of our

2511
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:42,260
or activate our nervous systems that we don't normally use

2512
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:44,260
is a very important thing

2513
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:45,260
ideal

2514
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:47,260
should be ideal

2515
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:48,260
I mean

2516
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:49,260
you read

2517
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:50,260
then go for a swim

2518
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:51,260
listening to music

2519
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:52,260
drawing a picture

2520
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:54,260
It means that you accept it many times

2521
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:57,260
Let all the nervous systems in your brain be activated

2522
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:59,260
His mutual connection will increase

2523
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,520
The best and the least derogatory

2524
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,720
But we know it's useless

2525
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,140
Because I want to be in this professional society

2526
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:08,280
you have to work and go to work

2527
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:10,100
You are civilian consciousness

2528
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,600
may include the fact that we use only

2529
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:15,240
those thinking minds

2530
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:17,480
nowhere else

2531
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:20,000
But what I'm going to say now is to say

2532
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Suppose we take individual

2533
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,880
into a rich and diverse environment

2534
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,040
English is the Environmental environment

2535
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,040
English is very full very full

2536
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:32,280
just turn it into a diverse and rich environment

2537
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:35,280
It is of great help to our nerve cells

2538
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:36,760
look

2539
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,760
This is what I did first

2540
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,880
then continue to pretend

2541
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,880
Is it here to buy a birdcage

2542
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:43,680
you haven't

2543
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:46,180
and then we'll put some fun stuff in the way

2544
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:47,360
Then

2545
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,040
This runner you know rats really like to run this

2546
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:51,080
Then we specially go to release

2547
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:51,800
those tree stands

2548
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,800
No, just cut some tree stands and put them over there

2549
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:57,480
You know mice like to drill pipes, drill holes

2550
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,000
so you see they're all happy inside

2551
01:27:59,000 --> 01:27:59,960
And then this one is just running down

2552
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,680
We usually do lab rats and they're boring

2553
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,640
They are kept in a cage every day

2554
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:06,680
two or three people standing there

2555
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:07,640
two or three mice

2556
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:10,480
adapt to me the same thing for a lifetime

2557
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:14,880
So their environment is very monotonous and boring

2558
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,200
Really, they can't live with

2559
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:20,240
you come across these mouse cakes in the park or in the gutter

2560
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,680
they are so happy

2561
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:25,040
So we can't experiment with some mice

2562
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,000
Otherwise those mice

2563
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,240
is far bigger than our caged rats

2564
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,240
There are many people

2565
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,120
they are all dull

2566
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:34,920
then we put them every day

2567
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:35,520
every day

2568
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,000
let them next time

2569
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,400
from the cage they live in

2570
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,400
get such an environment

2571
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,120
let them run for ten minutes

2572
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,240
only ten minutes

2573
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,080
ten minutes in the morning

2574
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:45,360
run this after running

2575
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:45,760
what is this

2576
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,120
I'll just take the delivery carton

2577
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,720
Take it to pick up a little black post

2578
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:51,200
also dig some holes

2579
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,040
then play some

2580
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,640
you see they play a lot

2581
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,080
heart bricks come and go

2582
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,040
and put some in it

2583
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,800
you see there are

2584
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:58,640
swing forward

2585
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:00,120
I found that mice like to eat

2586
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
So when you and I worship mice

2587
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Definitely buy light fresh fish

2588
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Then the shortbread kind

2589
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
They're here to play very happy

2590
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Fifteen minutes a day they play

2591
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
play this, play him this

2592
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Then put the cabinet dragon here

2593
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Let them do it again this afternoon

2594
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
You are only ten days in total

2595
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
then my young mouse

2596
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
and older mice

2597
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Because he has a mouse that is a year old

2598
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
he is not too old

2599
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
The lifespan of a mouse is about one year and ten months

2600
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
So you are up to two years

2601
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
up to two years up to two years

2602
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
so you talk about a one year old mouse

2603
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
we say he's not too old

2604
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
but he is h

2605
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
he is an old mouse

2606
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Like just now we probably

2607
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I think forty or fifty years old

2608
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
then we let them

2609
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
After running like this every day

2610
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Let them go to study with crystals again

2611
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I was doing this experiment

2612
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
trying to control them as a

2613
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
what i want to say is to say

2614
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
such an old mouse

2615
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
None of these trainings worked for him.

2616
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
too late with energy

2617
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
But the result of this experiment

2618
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
we have published

2619
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,000
This is the escape from the water to the ass

2620
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
time required

2621
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
so shorter is better

2622
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
this is an old mouse

2623
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I just sleep a lot

2624
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
control group

2625
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
control group

2626
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
This line is the control group

2627
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Didn't give him to play those games

2628
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
That group of mice

2629
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
It is to let him play every day for thirty years

2630
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Thirty years long, I want thirty years

2631
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
When I look at this data

2632
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
i was startled

2633
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
that's what you'll find

2634
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Even though the mouse is so old

2635
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
but you give him these every day

2636
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Diversified and rich visual environment

2637
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
he just learns faster

2638
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
And next door was testing his memory

2639
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
He also remembers better

2640
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
what does the time tell us

2641
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
just older people

2642
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
as long as you can learn

2643
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
can also function

2644
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
can also express

2645
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
don't go into a nursing home

2646
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
because that's a

2647
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
An environment that is neither rich nor diverse

2648
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
really so

2649
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
contact with society

2650
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
give yourself a little more stimulation

2651
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
is very important

2652
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
not old and bad

2653
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
not

2654
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
It's a kind of neuroexitability

2655
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
then we later

2656
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
tell him these two punches

2657
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
then test him

2658
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,760
It's just that there's one in his head

2659
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,260
Genes Associated with Neuroplasticity

2660
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:05,340
you can see

2661
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,800
Mice in rich and diverse environments

2662
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,680
He is more than twice as many as a phoenix mouse

2663
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,500
So we have countless

2664
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:15,620
Genes Associated with Neuroplasticity

2665
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:17,100
We speak of plasticity as

2666
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:20,080
Inspired again

2667
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:21,120
is the nervous system

2668
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,040
especially the brain

2669
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:25,420
a permanent process of adaptation to an environment

2670
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:26,460
permanent

2671
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:28,120
So don't you think you're 80

2672
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:29,220
you don't have this plasticity

2673
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:30,840
no you still have

2674
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,460
So you're going to find yourself some

2675
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:36,140
things you don't usually see

2676
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:37,500
or multiple stimuli

2677
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:40,060
Mouth your nerve cells

2678
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:41,740
Let your nerve cells and nerve cells

2679
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:43,100
link increase

2680
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:45,940
It's a permanent process of adaptation

2681
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:46,900
nervous system

2682
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:47,900
us

2683
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:49,780
I just said that we have countless such

2684
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:50,940
plasticity genes

2685
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:53,740
But we don't have us humans

2686
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:56,540
In other words, some of us have infinite predecessors

2687
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,300
But most of us

2688
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:00,300
None in our finite years

2689
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,600
Not getting the most out of our money

2690
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,000
it's a bit disappointing

2691
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:03,840
like us

2692
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,160
Let us humans evolve into

2693
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,200
a thought of the highest

2694
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,560
So you have to have confidence in yourself

2695
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:11,680
Then go develop your own money man

2696
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,440
go give yourself more

2697
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,720
make yourself present one more day

2698
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,640
you don't usually think about it

2699
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,000
or have not been exposed to some stimuli

2700
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,160
So older adults actually use the Internet more

2701
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:25,720
In fact, it's good to go online.

2702
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:26,720
because don't be afraid to learn

2703
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:27,800
you continue to use him

2704
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:29,520
Now the situation is the best idea

2705
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,480
Young people shouldn't help you write more on the Internet

2706
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:32,320
Desperately on the Internet

2707
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:33,640
but older people

2708
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,520
In fact, you should get in touch with them more.

2709
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:38,040
you didn't think about it

2710
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:38,720
you are educated

2711
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:39,760
no it doesn't matter

2712
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,040
That is to say, how much you learn counts

2713
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:42,840
I'm talking about your neural network.

2714
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,080
right where you are

2715
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:47,040
that can

2716
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,240
The more you use your brain

2717
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,600
the more you use your brain

2718
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,000
I got this from the internet

2719
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:51,840
The more efficient

2720
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,680
you will become more efficient

2721
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:54,120
Same

2722
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:55,640
Do you think of the exhaustion just now

2723
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,240
Get out of that hut

2724
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,960
where the fingers stand

2725
01:32:58,960 --> 01:32:59,960
you use it all the time

2726
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Your brain is less likely to shrink

2727
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,500
the more chance you have of dementia

2728
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,500
In fact, the further back you win

2729
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:08,500
not saying how

2730
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:10,000
In fact, modern medicine can

2731
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I just said he can't help

2732
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,500
There's nothing doctors can do to make him die

2733
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:14,500
regeneration back

2734
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,000
the only thing you can do is

2735
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Delay the onset of dementia

2736
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
one is backward

2737
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
You could have

2738
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Only at the age of 75, 70, and 80

2739
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
He extended to 88 years old

2740
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Maybe you can solve the problem

2741
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
This person is very rare

2742
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Or let him get serious, slow down

2743
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Medicine is doing things like this now

2744
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
after we understand

2745
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
we help ourselves

2746
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
delay the process

2747
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
ok , then i will stop here today

2748
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
I think that's what I'm going to write

2749
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Of course, the Institute of Biomedicine, Academia Sinica

2750
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
It's my company's case

2751
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
30 years

2752
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
then what i want to say is

2753
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
really yourself later

2754
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I think the best research unit in the world

2755
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
not only give us enough duel

2756
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,900
academic freedom and a lesson

2757
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:06,100
I can have a place to manage

2758
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:08,560
In addition, I think the work unit is

2759
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,840
what is given to us is

2760
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:12,860
The development of a scientist

2761
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:15,960
And the qualities that scientists should have

2762
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:17,500
I think my work unit

2763
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:19,160
have made great contributions

2764
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:21,200
i feel i'm lucky

2765
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,340
can work in this place for so long

2766
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:26,240
then this is

2767
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:27,240
Units will also look to support

2768
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:29,440
If everyone walks in through the gate of Academia Sinica

2769
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,040
Go 50 meters to the right

2770
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,840
The first building is

2771
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,940
This is the second picture

2772
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:36,940
And of course I'm grateful

2773
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:38,240
Now this year it will be renamed

2774
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:39,540
Resurrection of science and technology

2775
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:41,440
It used to be called the Biological Map of the National Science Council

2776
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,840
their thirty years of research funding

2777
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,540
support us to be able to

2778
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:47,940
do this series of research

2779
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:50,240
This is the current staff in my lab

2780
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:51,440
certainly

2781
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:55,240
Of course, these thirty years are not limited to these students

2782
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:58,140
Just now there is something about animals

2783
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:59,740
Substantive research is

2784
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:00,240
Congratulations

2785
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
The older one is my long-term full-time assistant

2786
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Mr. Ma is a postdoctoral fellow with me

2787
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Ph.D. has a Ph.D.

2788
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Besides I'm really

2789
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
say this very sincerely and sincerely

2790
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Thanks

2791
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
These teachers I just talked about

2792
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Because they share more than 90% of the sameness with us in the mysterious system

2793
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
That's why we experiment with them

2794
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
so i feel thankful

2795
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
it was they who sacrificed their

2796
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Research on the Perfection of Human Body

2797
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Let us live longer and healthier

2798
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
so in my eyes they are very cute animals

2799
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Our unit every year in the Central Plains

2800
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
during festivals

2801
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
very pious

2802
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
for all experimental animals

2803
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
a counting ceremony

2804
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I think even a scientist should

2805
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
to express

2806
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Finally, thank you all for listening to us.

2807
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Thanks

2808
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Thanks

2809
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I think everyone is learning a new knowledge today

2810
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
So your brain connections must have increased a lot today

2811
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Now we have about 25 minutes

2812
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Let me answer some questions for you

2813
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Raise your hand if you have a question

2814
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Then introduce yourself first what's your name

2815
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
With what school or institution

2816
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
then ask the question peace of mind

2817
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Then you can come tomorrow

2818
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
here's a microphone

2819
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Press the green button if you want to speak

2820
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Thank you teacher Max Lin Jianzhi for the wonderful lecture

2821
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
He is a graduate of our Taipei College

2822
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
but i was in taiwan university

2823
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Additional year of law degree

2824
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
because no matter what

2825
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
thank you very much for your presentation

2826
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Then what I want to ask is

2827
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
In fact, it was mentioned at the beginning

2828
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Forgetting makes our brain cells work less

2829
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
But then I kept encouraging

2830
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
we need to learn more

2831
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
many memories

2832
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Then let the one of your own brain

2833
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
This strength will be better

2834
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
all over me

2835
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,400
When I take it, it seems like a contradiction.

2836
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:04,400
We hope to know which will forget

2837
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,000
take it easy on the brain cells

2838
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,440
but you keep remembering

2839
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:09,640
Does studying put too much pressure on others?

2840
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:11,200
But this problem is in the back

2841
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:13,400
You said how round the environment you want

2842
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:15,840
That is to say, expanding the useless part

2843
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:18,140
Then there is another situation

2844
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:20,740
Does that mean I've been working on the same thing all the time?

2845
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:21,900
good for my head

2846
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:23,800
If this is the case

2847
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:26,200
I want to specifically clear the loss of teachers

2848
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:28,640
How can we make sure in life

2849
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:31,140
My life is a round of kung fu

2850
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:33,360
How do I know if I'm too expert

2851
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,360
the kind that wants to crush him

2852
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,460
Then the problem with the lucky bag is that you just said

2853
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:38,560
If you talk so much, you will be in a hurry

2854
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,360
No

2855
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:40,800
I just

2856
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:41,360
you actually

2857
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:42,360
i just have one question

2858
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:44,840
That is to say, we live our daily life like this

2859
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:46,600
how do i make sure of my life

2860
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,560
Not too specialized in trying to suppress him

2861
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:51,300
but I live in a multi-circular environment

2862
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:52,760
is how i know my life

2863
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:53,660
I know what you mean

2864
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:55,200
But I think it's better

2865
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,840
You just said the voice hands are awesome

2866
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:57,800
super exciting

2867
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,120
this is how i feel

2868
01:37:59,120 --> 01:37:59,960
mom didn't say

2869
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,840
He allowed everyone to have an agency in the country

2870
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:04,240
I think if it's convenient

2871
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:05,120
please tell me too

2872
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:06,800
How can everyone be at home

2873
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,360
if you come to work you will know

2874
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:10,680
well if so

2875
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:12,360
I forgot what you just said

2876
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:13,600
keep learning

2877
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:14,520
Is it a bit contradictory

2878
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:15,520
actually not

2879
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:16,400
because we learned

2880
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:16,840
we just talked

2881
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:17,720
We are actually neurological

2882
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:19,480
Instead, full resurrection forms this circuit

2883
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:20,880
After he reaches a certain level

2884
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,960
He put it next to his brain for storage.

2885
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,000
At this time, the bloody nerve

2886
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,680
back to his original

2887
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,520
fix the normal state

2888
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:29,160
ready for the next thing

2889
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:31,640
so he's not constantly excited

2890
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:33,360
And to the forgotten piece that says

2891
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,080
He has already formed a memory

2892
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:36,600
that membrane is there

2893
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:38,200
but he stand by

2894
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,840
He fell asleep

2895
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:40,920
so he is not tired

2896
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:42,040
you now take the gunpowder out

2897
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:43,800
Just let him recharge from the edge

2898
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,160
reply again

2899
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:46,960
The only thing that makes nerve blood hair tired is

2900
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:48,600
this short period

2901
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:49,720
keep making him gunpowder

2902
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:50,360
keep letting him

2903
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:52,320
He just passed the recovery period correction period

2904
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,720
just let him work

2905
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:54,800
just expired

2906
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:55,840
you just keep him working

2907
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,240
Even the reply period hasn't been said yet

2908
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:58,760
Come to the end

2909
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,920
How long does it take to shake your face

2910
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,100
you this long time

2911
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:05,100
I will now give an example

2912
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:06,900
I'm going to study again

2913
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,700
Thirty-eight degrees mouth thirty-eight degrees

2914
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:09,920
high school degree here

2915
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:10,700
I think both

2916
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:13,200
I've been my high school better than I've been since graduating girls

2917
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,420
I don't do my topic anymore

2918
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:15,400
I have no idea

2919
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,060
The reason why this topic is not used is very simple

2920
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:18,400
that I don't need anymore in my life

2921
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,220
know thirty eight degrees

2922
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:21,860
what's the point, right?

2923
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:24,520
But I used to be very good at this topic

2924
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:25,920
But what I said was

2925
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,000
you forgot to say

2926
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,520
you talk to me again now

2927
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:29,900
What to do at thirty-eight degrees

2928
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:31,760
i may recall some things

2929
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:34,360
It's different from what I've never learned

2930
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:35,660
this is

2931
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:38,260
It's not that I forgot, I can call it out

2932
01:39:38,260 --> 01:39:39,960
but things you totally forgot

2933
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:41,100
completely forgotten

2934
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:41,860
completely forgotten

2935
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:43,040
that's something to relearn

2936
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,260
renurning

2937
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:46,360
So I just talked about neurovascular

2938
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:47,960
Tired or not but it is like this

2939
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:49,140
what did you just do

2940
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:50,460
you say

2941
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:51,300
how do i know

2942
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:52,140
i am forgetful

2943
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:53,460
Do you want him or multiple

2944
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:54,700
this

2945
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:56,220
You feel

2946
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:58,160
Rich and diverse may be monotonous to me

2947
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,000
i feel monotonous

2948
01:39:59,000 --> 01:39:59,960
Feel rich at first

2949
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,360
but one we'll talk about

2950
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,840
You are the basis of the neuroblast to speak

2951
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,360
you just don't do one thing

2952
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:07,440
Forever only use that group of neurotic monsters

2953
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:08,960
I thought maybe you should

2954
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,880
You just finished speaking the language area here

2955
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,560
The visual zone is here

2956
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:14,320
art painting is here

2957
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,920
you are using your brain

2958
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:17,280
you should think

2959
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,760
just trying to get your stimulation

2960
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,840
Do you want to go from the middle every day

2961
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:22,720
exposure to stimuli

2962
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:23,920
diversify a little

2963
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:25,520
you go for a run and use your brain

2964
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:26,320
also sports

2965
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:27,760
go swimming with you

2966
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:30,320
The neuroblasts used may be different

2967
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,400
Because swimming requires a lot of balance

2968
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,160
running is ok

2969
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:37,040
So this is a little bit different

2970
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:37,600
will be different

2971
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:40,000
It's just another way of riding your bike

2972
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:40,720
another balance

2973
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:42,880
One is the balance of the water on the ground

2974
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,480
So the whole point of what I'm going to say is that

2975
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:47,520
this is what you imagined

2976
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:48,720
that is to say you

2977
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:51,360
when you go to listen to music today

2978
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:55,280
Do the math with what you're thinking about this angle and how many degrees

2979
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:59,440
It's actually two very different things.

2980
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:00,080
two bodies

2981
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,760
So let's say it like this

2982
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:09,460
Allow yourself to be exposed to different aspects of design

2983
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:13,400
I don't know if it's rich for you personally but for you

2984
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:16,200
I just want your nerve cells to be rich and right

2985
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:18,000
Different designs because he accepts

2986
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:20,760
Just thinking about his health

2987
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:25,320
Then you might feel like going for a run

2988
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:26,520
maybe not that fun

2989
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:27,760
but if it's good for him

2990
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:29,600
maybe you just resign yourself to being an ex-masculinity

2991
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,600
you go

2992
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,760
You said that Wei Lu is so good in the business

2993
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:38,120
because of our

2994
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:40,880
I think we are in my workplace

2995
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:43,520
Researchers are very specialized

2996
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,880
We often hear different people report

2997
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:46,600
different things

2998
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:47,960
According to foreign scholars

2999
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:49,800
let's not go out

3000
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:51,960
connect to the Internet

3001
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:54,440
until the world in every field

3002
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:56,160
what is the most advanced research

3003
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,000
Then there are no visiting scholars from abroad

3004
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
We are often judged

3005
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,400
Judging is stressful

3006
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,400
but i just said

3007
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:05,900
It is also the driving force for our progress

3008
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:11,100
So I think we are in line with the international academic community

3009
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:12,000
is very close

3010
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Although Fysical was the first member of the committee

3011
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
But I think in the field of science

3012
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,700
We are with the advanced science in the world

3013
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:25,300
The direction of research is very close to the footsteps

3014
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:28,100
So I think it really provides me with a

3015
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,900
diverse and rich environment

3016
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:32,900
ok thank you sir

3017
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:34,900
Then these two

3018
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:35,900
OK, bye

3019
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:37,900
Hello, reviewer, I am a student of Beiyi University

3020
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:39,900
In the Academia Sinica dedicated to announce the doctoral class

3021
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:41,900
Then my question is

3022
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:43,900
Because the first two mentioned

3023
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,900
Too much water four fifths

3024
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:47,900
Just Talamina E2 and D3C

3025
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:49,900
But I was talking about it a few days ago

3026
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:52,900
He seems to have a relationship with SHMDZ

3027
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:54,900
So the teacher doesn't know how to say this

3028
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:55,900
that another topic

3029
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:57,900
The other is the incidental topic

3030
01:42:57,900 --> 01:42:59,900
Another question is

3031
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,600
It's the Pretty Shoe thing I just talked about

3032
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:03,320
But it seems that there is no special mention

3033
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:05,960
Then I think it actually echoes the previous

3034
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:07,400
looks right

3035
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:08,760
Time and dimension要

3036
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:09,520
let it change

3037
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:12,000
don't this happen to me

3038
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,400
exercise more

3039
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:14,440
sleep well

3040
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:17,320
Then the answer to the question just now is

3041
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:18,760
How to know your own sports

3042
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:21,000
or activity or which sport

3043
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,160
these diverse environments

3044
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:24,040
good enough

3045
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:24,800
it's actually really easy

3046
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,040
You will know if you are happy or not

3047
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:27,640
I seem to be happy before going to bed

3048
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:28,240
very satisfied

3049
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:29,640
Then fill up and go to sleep

3050
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:31,000
did everything

3051
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,840
sportsman with our mountain climber

3052
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:33,800
this usually rides to the

3053
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:34,640
the tree also becomes

3054
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:35,280
unhappy

3055
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:36,640
that's enough

3056
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:37,880
ask the teacher to answer

3057
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:38,920
answer your first question

3058
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,640
Because I'm not doing diabetes research

3059
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:42,080
i don't know

3060
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,440
but

3061
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:45,640
The general direction is probably due to diabetes

3062
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:47,720
it has a problem with its metabolism

3063
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:49,760
Many morning metabolism is problematic

3064
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,680
so i don't know if

3065
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:52,920
because i'm not diabetic

3066
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:56,280
So there are some things that cannot be metabolized

3067
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:59,080
Accumulated in the blood brain of the gods

3068
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,640
damage some nerve cells

3069
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:07,000
or an inflammatory response

3070
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,400
This is my general direction, probably like this

3071
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:11,120
really really really how

3072
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:11,920
I am not very sure

3073
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,440
But research on candy bars

3074
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:14,840
the depression i just talked about

3075
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:16,400
that is

3076
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:17,720
birthday disease it's a bit annoying

3077
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:20,800
Which means it's really just a matter of memory.

3078
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:23,960
But you know when a person's social function

3079
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:24,800
can't remember when

3080
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,080
When many things are often easily forgotten

3081
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:29,440
it's basically its ability to socialize gets longer

3082
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,720
because it won't

3083
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,760
because what it says

3084
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:34,160
It can't remember what others say

3085
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:39,440
So gradually its degree of socialization will become longer and longer

3086
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:42,280
It is often reported in the "Bank" that

3087
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:43,960
Worldly affairs patients later

3088
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:46,120
He'll be engaged in the production of half-year-old melancholy

3089
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:48,320
because he was isolated

3090
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:51,120
so

3091
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:54,560
So when you can interact with society

3092
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:56,320
just try to interact

3093
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:59,920
Because in the end, there are many incidents

3094
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
other problems arise

3095
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
This matter is said to be a report of the clinical account

3096
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
It's the same thing as hesitation

3097
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
In fact, there is such a problem that it is not the party involved.

3098
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
The person involved will be a little frustrated at first

3099
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
but it develops to later

3100
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
It actually has nothing too wrong

3101
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
because it's a lot of a net

3102
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
In fact, the people around it will work harder

3103
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
People around will also be more likely to have this kind of

3104
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Situation of hesitation

3105
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
so i don't know you two

3106
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Sometimes, of course, these problems are

3107
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Medically advanced humans live so long

3108
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,000
It's been so long since this problem

3109
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
A few decades ago, human lifespan was not so long

3110
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
The problem doesn't appear to be that serious.

3111
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,000
But that said, it seems that the lifespan of human beings will continue to increase.

3112
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Because with the development of medicine

3113
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:50,000
So except when you are healthy

3114
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Create an environment for yourself

3115
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
It is not easy or something goes wrong in the wrong age

3116
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
you really feel symptoms

3117
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Or people around you will have symptoms

3118
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,240
go to the doctor early

3119
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:02,960
Just always be professional

3120
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:04,960
What tests does the doctor think can be done

3121
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:06,240
may be helpful

3122
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,000
This means that in terms of diagnosis

3123
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:09,560
it's still important

3124
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:11,840
Then if you look at it from another angle

3125
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,600
i would like to say

3126
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:15,600
This is a bit about the philosophy of human truth

3127
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,160
that is

3128
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:18,440
In fact, from another angle, we can say that

3129
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:21,760
It's just the appearance of this problem.

3130
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:22,520
you can also think like this

3131
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:26,360
That is to say, a person must be qualified to have this disease

3132
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:29,840
He has actually lived to a considerable age

3133
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,800
what ? because you don ' t see thirty or forty people

3134
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:34,240
so

3135
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,720
In fact, this person has

3136
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:39,520
overcame many difficulties in life

3137
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:41,520
also escaped many disasters

3138
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:43,440
escaped many other illnesses

3139
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:47,120
That's what I mean by using a

3140
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:51,280
Yes, accept him with a more optimistic attitude

3141
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:52,400
that's what i think

3142
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,080
Just no matter who you were at the time

3143
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:54,880
or people around

3144
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:56,400
because

3145
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,560
look, a young man

3146
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:00,560
did nothing

3147
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
just disappeared from the earth

3148
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
just something like the interface

3149
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
So it's just a mental thing

3150
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
But from a purely medical point of view

3151
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Of course we still want the photo to know

3152
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Because not just yourself and the people around you

3153
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
It's not so hard

3154
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Resources to society also end

3155
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Otherwise Medical Resources

3156
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Make sure these are real

3157
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
is also very disadvantaged

3158
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
It's also very bad for money.

3159
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
So I'm fine up front

3160
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Thank you, Professor Yi

3161
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I am Xincheng

3162
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
I am 38 years old

3163
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
young old man

3164
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Friends call me Tony

3165
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
that me

3166
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
I get up every morning now

3167
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
I'll just keep two of those laptops

3168
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
That BBC News

3169
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
But I'm too old to care

3170
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
What national event water becomes president

3171
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
I don't care

3172
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
But I watch that Felix column every day

3173
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
all over the world now

3174
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Whether it is Chinese or foreign

3175
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Taiwanese

3176
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Love the population in Sea Membrane

3177
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
proportional increase

3178
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
But there's a big reason in it

3179
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
is interpersonal

3180
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,000
It is easy for us to understand

3181
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
interpersonal skills

3182
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
In addition it has two main comparisons that say

3183
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,000
our birth environment

3184
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
birth pressure

3185
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,000
one more thing

3186
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
it says who we are now

3187
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,000
That shoots too much protein

3188
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
so itchy

3189
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
is there any rival

3190
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
So give us some guidance

3191
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Disclosure

3192
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
because i'm not living

3193
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
nutritionist

3194
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,000
I'm not a doctor either

3195
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
so i don't know

3196
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
This is because certain ingredients

3197
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
how about extra many or extra small

3198
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,000
but i just said

3199
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
our nerve cells

3200
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
or starch cells

3201
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Its structure is very simple

3202
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
it doesn't need much from us

3203
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
It only requires some basic

3204
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
basic amount of protein

3205
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
fat minerals

3206
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
vitamins etc.

3207
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
starch etc.

3208
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
good carbohydrate

3209
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,000
it will be efficient to do

3210
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,000
neurons in our brain

3211
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
all protein needed

3212
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,600
So I think a lot of things are

3213
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:05,380
Appropriate amount is good

3214
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:08,380
In our age, there are very few people who enter

3215
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:11,380
The old tail dies due to lack of nutrition

3216
01:49:11,380 --> 01:49:12,980
not such a problem

3217
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:16,380
So of course there is an argument that too much protein

3218
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:18,880
Is it bad or load

3219
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,880
then i just recall

3220
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:24,880
Early years in our previous generation with older

3221
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:27,080
It's Mr. Yang Zhengning, many of them

3222
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:29,000
They didn't have dead nutrition at that time

3223
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,000
are not enough

3224
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
People's nutrition is waiting to be told by others

3225
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,000
So I think these things are

3226
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,000
our cells or our body

3227
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:43,000
The nutrients that need the elements are six categories

3228
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
almost enough

3229
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:48,000
In fact, don’t talk too much, it’s a walk for everyone

3230
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
It is the first one that is a burden to your liver

3231
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
because he's going to metabolize him

3232
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
This is a burden on the kidneys

3233
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
I don't know why the Xisheng population in Taiwan

3234
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
will run to number one in the world

3235
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
just don't understand

3236
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
it's just too concentrated

3237
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
things it can't filter out

3238
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
So it's possible we're

3239
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,000
attitude of human absorption

3240
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,000
things we may not necessarily need

3241
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
so that our organs

3242
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Can't get back together

3243
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
the liver and kidney organs

3244
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Then you can think of our brains as

3245
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,000
an organ of the body

3246
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
So just don't over

3247
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
not too much

3248
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
if you die like this

3249
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
I think you have a little lack

3250
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Thanks

3251
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
our gentleman

3252
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
wait a minute he doesn't ask

3253
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
it's okay i'm in no rush to leave

3254
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
so he has a problem

3255
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
i can play more

3256
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
who

3257
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
hello my name is zhong

3258
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Hello Li Bo

3259
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
The question I want to ask is

3260
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Like today's topic

3261
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,280
brain is complex

3262
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,280
This general concept is for everyone

3263
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:08,000
Ordinary people are not good at some understanding

3264
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,600
Then I want to understand

3265
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:11,280
research on the brain

3266
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:13,120
Of course, there are also aspects of deduction

3267
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:15,440
Is there anyone who is the first in this field?

3268
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:18,240
is the direction of research in the House of Representatives

3269
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:19,440
or which way to go

3270
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:21,520
The main reason is that there is a lot of hunting environment

3271
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:22,400
for example

3272
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:24,320
sympathetic part

3273
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,560
its constant part

3274
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,400
there's some ideology

3275
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,000
some people like

3276
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,200
And another previous century

3277
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:32,400
chairman of their memory

3278
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:34,160
use their memory

3279
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:36,400
The chairman himself is studying this part

3280
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,000
what did you ask you last

3281
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:38,400
What

3282
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,000
what did you ask you last

3283
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:40,960
what memory

3284
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,000
that is

3285
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,360
The chairman of the board of directors is the major field of National Taiwan University

3286
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:46,560
What is the efficacy of that field

3287
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:47,680
they have done this

3288
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:49,360
Another aspect of research

3289
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,520
I just said that some people are too old to protect their mothers

3290
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:53,120
seen too many people

3291
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:55,760
Then their learning is another level

3292
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,760
so

3293
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:59,280
just from a young age

3294
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:00,080
this one is

3295
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
come through hopeless

3296
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,000
some people are born with

3297
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Knowledge is quite rich

3298
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Of course, another magnetic field related to brain waves

3299
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Communicate with another understanding

3300
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,000
like this study

3301
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
I'm covering a wide range of topics here

3302
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
i didn't come to ask this question

3303
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
what i want to ask is to say

3304
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
At present, if research in this area

3305
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Probably the world is still super-picked up in the direction

3306
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,000
pick up the brain

3307
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
because picking up is blurry

3308
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
then research over there

3309
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
we already know

3310
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
probably you all know

3311
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Thanks

3312
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
this you just said

3313
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,000
current research on the brain

3314
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
memory research

3315
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,000
what is the direction

3316
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,000
what's the point

3317
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
this is what i was about to say

3318
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
This is another world wave

3319
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
this VG

3320
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I'll talk about that right away

3321
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Current focus on neuroscience research

3322
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
is the word Circuit

3323
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
That is to say, our brain

3324
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:00,000
form this nerve

3325
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Between the nerve cells of the brain

3326
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:08,000
forming this network its importance

3327
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
It is to study diseases, to study systems

3328
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
rather than studying single cells

3329
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Must study a population of cells

3330
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
And the network it forms between this group of cells

3331
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,000
In our human beings regardless of learning memory

3332
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Transmission of Pain Senses

3333
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,000
and its role in disease

3334
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Stericate

3335
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,000
I will talk about System Biology

3336
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
with emphasis

3337
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
on your own or circuit

3338
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
neuralgia path neuralgia path

3339
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
So we're a hardcore ghost

3340
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,000
integrated system

3341
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Instead of looking at single and single cells

3342
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
is everything that connects them

3343
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
As for what you just said

3344
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
conscious, subconscious

3345
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Those things seem to be more of a psychological level.

3346
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I think this now has a field called cognitive science

3347
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
not so long now

3348
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Cognitive science

3349
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Because abandonment has to wait for the advanced development of technology

3350
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,540
Current trends in cognitive science

3351
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:02,700
at least in america

3352
01:54:02,700 --> 01:54:05,100
Obama or something like that will go down

3353
01:54:06,100 --> 01:54:06,940
what to do

3354
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:09,100
There is a professor Jiang Anshi in China

3355
01:54:09,100 --> 01:54:11,880
do that in fruit eagle city

3356
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:12,700
functional mapping

3357
01:54:12,700 --> 01:54:15,040
It is the correspondence between functions and some packages

3358
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:17,240
Which nerve cell does what function

3359
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:19,080
he hikes with a nerve

3360
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:20,740
mark him clearly

3361
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:21,980
remember every time

3362
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:25,580
But this matter is easier to do in Guoying

3363
01:54:25,580 --> 01:54:26,780
Because fruit eagle is very simple

3364
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:28,280
he has very few nerve cells

3365
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:29,800
so you can go one by one

3366
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:30,440
map

3367
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:31,900
Follow the map to find the map

3368
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:33,800
what does this nerve cell do

3369
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:34,440
broken

3370
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:35,700
He may not have any function

3371
01:54:35,700 --> 01:54:37,200
hit something

3372
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:38,600
how is he responsible for what

3373
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:39,740
real

3374
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:42,040
but in human

3375
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:44,000
I think this thing is difficult to do

3376
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,940
I've also asked a lot of neuroscientists

3377
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:48,240
They find it extremely difficult

3378
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:49,240
because

3379
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:50,580
that nerve cell

3380
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:51,940
you want to talk about structure

3381
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:52,600
it's all that simple

3382
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:53,280
i just said

3383
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:54,540
battery discharge

3384
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:56,340
The chemical then passes on to the next

3385
01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:57,800
But why this nerve cell

3386
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:59,040
chop down here

3387
01:54:59,040 --> 01:54:59,940
in a certain area

3388
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,680
He is in charge of this matter to that matter

3389
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:04,840
you spread it out

3390
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:08,140
Just look at his characteristics, they are all the same

3391
01:55:08,140 --> 01:55:10,540
This is his rich house

3392
01:55:10,540 --> 01:55:12,040
you say something

3393
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:14,380
Aware of a better continuous test

3394
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:16,400
then you might say some people

3395
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:18,240
very casually

3396
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:18,640
some people

3397
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:19,780
maybe honest

3398
01:55:19,780 --> 01:55:20,900
some people are very talkative

3399
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:22,540
What kind of neurotic do you think this is?

3400
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:23,440
what are you doing

3401
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:24,940
Other access

3402
01:55:24,940 --> 01:55:27,040
really did not do

3403
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:28,900
I don't know what to do

3404
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:33,500
So the complexity of human

3405
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:34,700
yes

3406
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:35,900
suppose i should say

3407
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:37,260
That's what scientists pay attention to

3408
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:39,140
After rigorous experimental manipulation

3409
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:42,540
to get reproducible results

3410
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:44,500
If you say he should be the same

3411
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:45,200
but something

3412
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:48,140
If we are not easy to manipulate

3413
01:55:48,140 --> 01:55:49,500
such as the subconscious

3414
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,100
why did i study psychology

3415
01:55:51,100 --> 01:55:52,540
Later I studied neuroscience

3416
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:55,300
because I'm studying psychology

3417
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:57,300
some existentialism

3418
01:55:57,300 --> 01:55:58,240
what humanism

3419
01:55:58,240 --> 01:55:59,940
i really find it difficult for me to understand

3420
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,200
Because that's abstract and I don't know the consent of that existence

3421
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:06,160
how can i replace him

3422
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:08,360
or how to verify him

3423
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:10,160
then i just say

3424
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:13,120
This theory of Freud

3425
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:14,280
It's actually amazing

3426
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:15,440
conscious subconscious

3427
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,720
He can also answer many questions

3428
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:20,280
For example, people in our polite

3429
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:21,480
you taught us education

3430
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:23,200
let us many things are in our

3431
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:26,240
What not to do in normal life to deal with the state

3432
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:28,200
then you may have some stress

3433
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:29,520
So Freud's theory says

3434
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:30,400
you're going to sleep

3435
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:31,720
subconsciously

3436
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:32,920
when dreaming

3437
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:35,080
This is dreaming has a great function

3438
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,440
but let you put your usual

3439
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:40,680
Release what needs to be suppressed

3440
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:41,880
It's healthier for people

3441
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:44,240
And especially Freudians like to talk about sex

3442
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:45,040
Sex

3443
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:46,080
I think discussing what he does

3444
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:46,960
what he said

3445
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:48,120
In fact, there are his theoretical techniques

3446
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:50,200
He has also been quoted

3447
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:52,080
just say biological

3448
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:53,640
From a neuroscience point of view

3449
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:55,720
What we often do is to

3450
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:58,480
really can control that factor

3451
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:00,400
There are doses that can exceed the

3452
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,900
Then we look at the result

3453
01:57:01,900 --> 01:57:04,500
So for magnetic fields these

3454
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:06,100
We will then

3455
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:07,800
I don't really know how to do experimental combat

3456
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:10,100
this may be

3457
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:12,900
Ask a psycho to go home and work with a physicist

3458
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:15,000
to do something like this

3459
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,100
But we do have magnetic fields and all that

3460
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:19,800
The magnetic field will respond to the magnetic field

3461
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:21,800
it's also true

3462
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:24,200
Look at the bees and ants

3463
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:25,700
They all know the way to go home

3464
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:28,700
I think they know the way better than me

3465
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:30,800
they can many birds can fly that far

3466
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:33,400
he knows where to go

3467
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:36,100
I don’t know that we in Taiwan later discovered that

3468
01:57:36,100 --> 01:57:37,700
end of a bee's pen scar

3469
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:39,500
there is a large area

3470
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:41,700
Is it all iron or is it all iron

3471
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:42,900
So it this iron will

3472
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:45,200
Because the police station is sensitive to magnetic fields

3473
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:48,000
Did this help him find his way?

3474
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,300
felt

3475
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:50,900
Because we don't know the audience

3476
01:57:50,900 --> 01:57:53,000
Needless to say they may be sensitive to magnetic fields

3477
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,300
so this is him

3478
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:56,100
what does he know about these bees

3479
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:57,200
run out fly into him

3480
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:58,600
he went back to his house later

3481
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:08,600
It is the changes caused by the reprinting of those metals to the magnetic field

3482
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:11,620
we don't know

3483
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:14,840
The magnetic field of human wisdom will be reflected by the magnetic field

3484
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:17,280
That's why we need to ignore our hearts and brains

3485
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:20,120
That's why we need to say when it's time to go to the exam room

3486
01:58:20,120 --> 01:58:22,760
We need to reprint all possible magnetic fields

3487
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:24,160
Everything that hangs on the magnetic field must be removed.

3488
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:27,120
Because of your influence because we will spread to

3489
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:29,320
Is it a question I'm asking

3490
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:31,360
I'm just messing around

3491
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:32,520
the question i want to ask

3492
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:34,800
Like IBM it uses an analog

3493
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:37,480
Like a descender, it will deduce various functions by using

3494
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:41,360
Then compare this system with the brain

3495
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:42,920
then do development

3496
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:44,720
That is to say, do it with a computer

3497
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:46,200
similarated brain like this

3498
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:48,560
similaration and then fully deduce the function of the brain

3499
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:50,400
memorize and calculate what

3500
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,400
if it uses another system

3501
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:54,040
Then deal with it in a temper tantrum

3502
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:55,760
You can use my temper

3503
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:57,200
Ok, everyone has my System on the other side

3504
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:58,640
actually walked in here

3505
01:58:58,640 --> 01:58:59,920
I don't know about foreign countries

3506
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
because we walk the system

3507
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,000
For example, a park that looks like a cranial nerve

3508
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
The function also has MARY square

3509
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Even his definition is unclear

3510
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
so you look at us again

3511
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
how to integrate

3512
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Because of Subsistence to

3513
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Then the Tortus System

3514
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Then System and another System

3515
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
The whole link is done and Grashing

3516
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
There is still a lot of complexity

3517
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Then it looks like I don't even know the basic definition

3518
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
I just have one question then and that is

3519
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Do this like the black face

3520
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Deduced from overseas brain nerves and computers

3521
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
integrated interface

3522
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Does anyone in Taiwan do this?

3523
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
I think there is

3524
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Broadly speaking, as you said

3525
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
artificial intelligence

3526
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Partificial in Taiwan

3527
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,000
When I went back to Taiwan while chanting Huasu Mountain

3528
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
have this name

3529
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
artificial intelligence

3530
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Then what is developed now is to use computers

3531
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Use a similar computer

3532
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
but I as a biologist

3533
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
I always feel that the computer

3534
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:56,000
It is difficult to completely simulate the human brain

3535
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
It can be at the physical interface

3536
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Physical

3537
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,240
C6M like electric signal

3538
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:04,240
How big is the Spike, what is the frequency?

3539
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:06,240
It can be even more precise than the human mind

3540
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,440
But the problem is you use a computer

3541
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:10,840
Simulate those functions

3542
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,640
those individual elements

3543
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,600
it can never be explained

3544
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:15,560
Why

3545
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:18,200
Your cell in the network

3546
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:19,200
this unit

3547
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:20,440
it is emotional

3548
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:22,200
it is fun

3549
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:23,640
You can't explain this

3550
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:25,800
Why is this other cell

3551
02:00:25,960 --> 02:00:27,040
it can think

3552
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:32,480
or is it something that can feel artistic or abstract

3553
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:35,280
When applied to functions

3554
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:37,840
it sees these

3555
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,440
Elements of these units simulated in the computer

3556
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:41,800
it can't explain

3557
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:42,840
it can only explain

3558
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,800
Physical very basic physical phenomenon

3559
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:46,040
This explanation is more precise

3560
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:47,080
is so

3561
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:53,480
So the human brain has its very mysterious and incredible

3562
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:56,840
This guy over here is ively sane

3563
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:05,920
Teacher Li and I happen to be neighbors

3564
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:10,000
So I knew about this message before posting it

3565
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:14,000
First of all, thank you because he was before the lecturer system

3566
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,420
Introduction to that memory and forgetting

3567
02:01:17,420 --> 02:01:19,080
Then my question is

3568
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:21,700
my friend's relatives

3569
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:26,000
Suffering is a flower-seeking teacher-made disease

3570
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,460
Some are in their twenties and thirties

3571
02:01:29,460 --> 02:01:31,620
And he finds sex by himself

3572
02:01:31,620 --> 02:01:37,960
It seems that he has a difficult problem to deal with.

3573
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:40,760
Another related question is

3574
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:46,660
Asked for my friend in his nineties

3575
02:01:46,660 --> 02:01:49,160
he is a serious learner

3576
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:51,160
so how is his life

3577
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:54,860
he often sleeps very little

3578
02:01:54,860 --> 02:01:58,860
Then what he's worried about is the opiates and painkillers.

3579
02:01:58,860 --> 02:02:00,860
will it affect us

3580
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
our brainpower

3581
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,000
right

3582
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
OK

3583
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
good

3584
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
You just talked about the premature

3585
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
This is really medical

3586
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
relatively unresolved piece

3587
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,000
That is to say more incomprehensible

3588
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
because this is really

3589
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,000
innate genetic factors

3590
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,000
accounted for a large part

3591
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Then I don't know his relatives

3592
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
are there many people

3593
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,000
is there such a marriage

3594
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,000
So I think this is relatively impossible

3595
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
when he might be bearing the next generation

3596
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
will really pay attention

3597
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Then you say it's better to be cancerous

3598
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
You just said sleeping pills or headache medicine

3599
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Headache medicine

3600
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,000
i think to be honest

3601
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,000
I don't know if

3602
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,000
how much did he eat

3603
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,000
that pair

3604
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
You and I have been neighbors for decades

3605
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,000
but you may not know

3606
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:46,000
I have severe migraines

3607
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,000
I'm biased

3608
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
I have a vascular migraine

3609
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,000
it just stinks

3610
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
It's just that the blood vessels are very dilated.

3611
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,000
so i need medicine

3612
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
constrict blood vessels

3613
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,000
It was like this when I was in college

3614
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
is a constitution

3615
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,000
I have eaten for more than 30 years

3616
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,000
i feel ok

3617
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
My liver function was normal when I went for the test

3618
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
it's basically a metabolic problem

3619
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000
It's a liver hurt stomach

3620
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
But now the headache medicine

3621
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
it's all well done

3622
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
aspin

3623
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,000
you know aspin is a slime

3624
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
really great drug

3625
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,000
He talks about finger pain

3626
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,000
cardiovascular disease

3627
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
have a little preventive effect

3628
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,000
But aspin because of a stomachache

3629
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,000
So later develop the most common

3630
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
The whole world should just fix it

3631
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Eating the most food in the world is not an excellent disease

3632
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
It's Prolactin

3633
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Because people are under a lot of pressure, they are chasing back and chasing pain

3634
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
I'm eating this too

3635
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
I'm not eating so strong

3636
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
when i really have a headache

3637
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
I will eat

3638
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,000
I ate that day, actually that day

3639
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
headache is not a disease

3640
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Inner symptoms are resolved

3641
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
it's called sinclair

3642
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
it's not a disease

3643
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,000
It's fine when the symptoms are gone

3644
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
I have eaten this way for decades

3645
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
My liver function is ok

3646
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Because pronatol is different from aspin

3647
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
He added a little buffer

3648
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,000
he added something

3649
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:00,000
so my body is not fit

3650
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Aspiny is relatively normal stomach

3651
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,000
i look

3652
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
i am an example

3653
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
so i think it should

3654
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Headache is OK

3655
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
insomnia medicine

3656
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Actually, I think it's time to talk to the doctor.

3657
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Because it's actually an insomnia drug

3658
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,000
also a lot

3659
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
the doctor will augment

3660
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,000
everyone's situation

3661
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,000
will prescribe that drug

3662
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
But when people get older

3663
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
insomnia will become

3664
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
just can't sleep

3665
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,000
long sleep phase

3666
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
It's actually quite normal

3667
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
We'll go back to places like the ghost

3668
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
ghost is sleeping

3669
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
sleep, wake up

3670
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
when we were adults

3671
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,000
when forty or fifty years old

3672
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Easier

3673
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Young people are not getting enough sleep

3674
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:36,000
have been sleeping

3675
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
eight hours of sleep, nine hours like that

3676
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
sleep eight hours straight nine hours

3677
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,000
you are healthy

3678
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,000
older people

3679
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
you may be in this person

3680
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Such a situation is found in people

3681
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
He probably slept for five hours, six hours

3682
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,000
he just

3683
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,000
he is enough

3684
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
but he only needs

3685
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,000
so young people are

3686
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
you are going to sleep

3687
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,000
you after a while

3688
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,000
fell asleep for a while

3689
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:57,000
it doesn't matter

3690
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,000
but when you fall asleep

3691
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
to be able to sleep for hours at a time

3692
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,160
Your sleep cycle can only be complete

3693
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:05,340
every one of you what do you know

3694
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:07,120
Ccard Weifa dream period

3695
02:05:07,120 --> 02:05:10,840
You've heard of the rapid eye movement period

3696
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:11,720
Rapid eye movement

3697
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:12,320
that's important

3698
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:14,040
that was dreaming period

3699
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:15,720
You just need to sleep for a certain amount of time

3700
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:17,800
All these cycles he's done

3701
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:19,400
so the doctor may see

3702
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:21,840
Give him a good four hours of sleep

3703
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:23,720
But it's four hours better than if you can't sleep all the time

3704
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:24,680
or wake up in half an hour

3705
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:25,600
woke up in half an hour

3706
02:05:25,600 --> 02:05:26,440
woke up in half an hour

3707
02:05:26,440 --> 02:05:28,040
much better

3708
02:05:28,040 --> 02:05:29,200
so i think it's been a year

3709
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:30,480
medicine is already

3710
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:33,000
I think

3711
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,120
The world's doctors on insomnia drugs

3712
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:37,240
Actually quite understand

3713
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:38,200
because i know friends

3714
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:39,760
He has been eating for twenty or thirty years

3715
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:41,800
can help him sleep for more than four hours

3716
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:42,680
more than four hours

3717
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:45,080
He goes to bed at nine o'clock and wakes up at three o'clock

3718
02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:46,080
he still sleeps very short

3719
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:47,200
But for him

3720
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:49,240
He has been asleep for hours

3721
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:50,320
enough

3722
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:53,960
So let's say it's all a bit simpler now

3723
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:54,720
take a blood test

3724
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:55,920
If dry index is normal

3725
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:57,560
If the kidney index is normal

3726
02:05:57,560 --> 02:05:58,400
Actually this medicine

3727
02:05:58,400 --> 02:05:59,840
basically no damage

3728
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,740
Holy day college classmate

3729
02:06:01,740 --> 02:06:02,500
so

3730
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:04,940
At 90 years old, I think I can handle everything

3731
02:06:04,940 --> 02:06:05,440
I think

3732
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:06,640
I can

3733
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:09,140
I didn't know it was possible to do whatever I wanted again

3734
02:06:09,140 --> 02:06:11,240
I don't know what happened in the 80s and 90s

3735
02:06:11,240 --> 02:06:11,740
but

3736
02:06:11,740 --> 02:06:13,140
I know everything

3737
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:15,140
ok our last question

3738
02:06:15,140 --> 02:06:16,640
but if say

3739
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:18,140
good

3740
02:06:18,140 --> 02:06:19,040
good come

3741
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:19,940
please

3742
02:06:19,940 --> 02:06:21,440
Hello teacher, I am now

3743
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:22,440
I now

3744
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:24,440
Hello teacher, I am Zeng Jianzhu

3745
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:26,440
I am now at Oxford University in England

3746
02:06:26,440 --> 02:06:28,440
Ph.D candidate at Korea Research Center

3747
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:30,440
Then the subject of my research is

3748
02:06:30,440 --> 02:06:32,440
Provide services for the elderly in Taiwan

3749
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:34,440
Non-profit organizations

3750
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:35,440
basically

3751
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:36,440
Non-profit organizations

3752
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:37,440
will be fine

3753
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:39,440
so i have two questions

3754
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:40,440
May be more practical

3755
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:41,440
But it is also hoped that the

3756
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:42,440
more scientific point of view

3757
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:45,440
can provide some different thinking

3758
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:46,440
The first part is

3759
02:06:46,440 --> 02:06:47,440
Yes or no

3760
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:48,440
essentially

3761
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:50,440
He is to a large extent

3762
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:51,440
no way

3763
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:52,440
is irreversible

3764
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:53,440
that is

3765
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:54,440
be a patient

3766
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:56,440
it's more difficult to go

3767
02:06:56,440 --> 02:06:57,440
can have some thoughts

3768
02:06:57,440 --> 02:06:59,440
or mental and deteriorating

3769
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,260
This is the first question

3770
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:03,060
Then the second question if

3771
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:04,760
The answer to the first question is Yes

3772
02:07:04,760 --> 02:07:07,000
Then what I want to ask next is

3773
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Assume in case a family is unlucky

3774
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,800
its members

3775
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:12,360
this happened

3776
02:07:12,360 --> 02:07:15,760
For the family members who accompany you

3777
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:17,560
what families can do

3778
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:20,260
On the one hand, to help the world

3779
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:22,560
have a better old age

3780
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:25,560
On the other hand, let yourself be a care giver

3781
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:27,560
won't have such a big burden

3782
02:07:27,560 --> 02:07:28,560
Thank you, teacher

3783
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:29,760
The latter belongs to

3784
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:31,760
Sociological way

3785
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:33,760
right

3786
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:34,760
in front

3787
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:36,760
unfortunately to tell you

3788
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:38,760
really no way

3789
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:39,760
and

3790
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:40,760
i can say that

3791
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:42,760
The United States invested a lot of money

3792
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:44,760
developing Alzheimer's drug

3793
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:45,760
Help the world in many ways

3794
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:48,760
It is to give this one machine that one from the neural pathway

3795
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:50,760
Actually spent a lot of money

3796
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:53,760
In fact, the answer is no

3797
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:54,760
a very important

3798
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:56,760
There is no better curative effect

3799
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:57,760
The current medicine may actually

3800
02:07:57,760 --> 02:07:58,760
still the same as decades ago

3801
02:07:58,760 --> 02:07:59,760
just maybe a little more

3802
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,640
the reason is simple

3803
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:03,900
It's the cells that die and don't regenerate

3804
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:04,980
That's it

3805
02:08:04,980 --> 02:08:06,480
it is an irreversible

3806
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:08,000
So neurodegenerative disease

3807
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,480
it will only get heavier

3808
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:10,280
not only this

3809
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:11,980
Eight classics of life of life of life of life of life of life

3810
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:13,980
It's just that the number of lost people is relatively large

3811
02:08:13,980 --> 02:08:17,680
So what is the direction the United States is doing now?

3812
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:19,180
it's no longer blooming waist

3813
02:08:19,180 --> 02:08:19,980
no more liver

3814
02:08:19,980 --> 02:08:21,980
What it does now is the Stensile

3815
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:22,980
It is IPS

3816
02:08:22,980 --> 02:08:23,980
is inducible

3817
02:08:23,980 --> 02:08:24,980
that germ layer

3818
02:08:24,980 --> 02:08:25,980
cell ectoderm

3819
02:08:25,980 --> 02:08:27,480
Can be differentiated

3820
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:28,480
for example

3821
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:31,160
That differentiated into the liver and what and what

3822
02:08:31,160 --> 02:08:33,160
These organs come

3823
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:35,460
to disease

3824
02:08:35,460 --> 02:08:36,960
or nerve gland diseases for treatment

3825
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:38,960
because it was an embryo transfer

3826
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:39,960
I remember we used to be at the restoration plant

3827
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:41,960
Zhang Optical Restoration Factory is the birthplace of the Eight Classics

3828
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:43,460
He is taking embryo transfer

3829
02:08:43,460 --> 02:08:44,960
But this embryo transfer

3830
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:45,760
may be better

3831
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:47,460
but it's very controversial

3832
02:08:47,460 --> 02:08:48,460
because of this someone

3833
02:08:48,460 --> 02:08:49,960
someone intentionally aborted what

3834
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:50,960
only

3835
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:52,960
no, use that embryo

3836
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:53,960
for brain transplant

3837
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:55,960
So what is done now is called

3838
02:08:55,960 --> 02:08:57,960
differentiation of stem cells

3839
02:08:58,440 --> 02:08:59,440
That

3840
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:00,440
my home

3841
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,540
Like many teams in the United States are

3842
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:02,500
it's not easy to do

3843
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:04,200
Even put a lot of announcements on this

3844
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:06,300
But science is always progressing

3845
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:07,540
scientists are always trying

3846
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:08,280
so

3847
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:10,100
And sometimes you know that scientific discoveries

3848
02:09:10,100 --> 02:09:11,380
It's all you line up like this

3849
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:13,580
when do you think it might come out

3850
02:09:13,580 --> 02:09:15,580
you can do nothing for a long time

3851
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:18,380
But you also sometimes have unexpected surprises and discoveries

3852
02:09:18,380 --> 02:09:18,880
is so

3853
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:21,080
So as long as there is doing

3854
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:23,380
Anyway, there is always hope for human beings

3855
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:24,880
There may be spiritual requirements

3856
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:26,180
So for now

3857
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:28,880
In fact, the real research on Alzheimer's disease in the United States is

3858
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:30,080
Actually

3859
02:09:30,080 --> 02:09:31,920
is slowly selling down

3860
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:33,280
unless something shows up

3861
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:34,720
what's new

3862
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:37,120
that might be put down later

3863
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:38,400
as you say

3864
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:39,520
Is there anyone in the family like this?

3865
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:41,320
I think

3866
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:42,800
I just got the point

3867
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:45,200
In fact, it may be more

3868
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:46,500
take care of this person

3869
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:47,600
so

3870
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:50,040
because it's a big burden

3871
02:09:50,040 --> 02:09:51,680
I think apart from the psychological

3872
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:55,380
Psychological means to know

3873
02:09:55,380 --> 02:09:58,040
This is an irreversible phenomenon

3874
02:09:58,040 --> 02:09:59,700
just accept it

3875
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,620
In reality, I think

3876
02:10:02,620 --> 02:10:07,460
Ability to ask for personal assistance to take care of patients

3877
02:10:07,460 --> 02:10:09,860
let yourself get enough rest

3878
02:10:09,860 --> 02:10:10,680
take a break

3879
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:12,420
this thing is still important

3880
02:10:12,420 --> 02:10:15,200
Because otherwise it's just one more member

3881
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:18,580
One more member is more useful

3882
02:10:18,580 --> 02:10:21,360
or other symptoms of unemployment

3883
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:23,300
Of course you said that for the patients themselves

3884
02:10:23,300 --> 02:10:25,560
If he still has contact with the outside world

3885
02:10:25,560 --> 02:10:28,100
or when he still responds to stimuli

3886
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:30,140
I think he went to play mahjong

3887
02:10:30,140 --> 02:10:33,220
Talk to everyone and talk about what to pick up

3888
02:10:33,220 --> 02:10:34,180
Actually it's all good

3889
02:10:34,180 --> 02:10:36,020
just use your brain

3890
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:37,740
he can use his brain

3891
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:39,780
expose him to the outside world

3892
02:10:39,780 --> 02:10:42,820
Both are better than ISO classes alone

3893
02:10:42,820 --> 02:10:43,340
is better

3894
02:10:43,340 --> 02:10:46,420
Because we're going to keep his nerve cells alive

3895
02:10:46,420 --> 02:10:48,540
able to interact with other nerve cells

3896
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:51,700
This will delay his illness

3897
02:10:51,700 --> 02:10:53,900
Just one day, twenty years later

3898
02:10:53,900 --> 02:10:55,700
I think playing mahjong is actually very good

3899
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:56,860
people often ask me this question

3900
02:10:56,860 --> 02:10:57,940
Not today

3901
02:10:57,940 --> 02:10:58,940
this one plays mahjong

3902
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,320
a very simple principle

3903
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:02,120
we talk about thinking

3904
02:11:02,120 --> 02:11:03,320
we say use

3905
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:04,720
not cranky

3906
02:11:04,720 --> 02:11:05,720
is thinking

3907
02:11:05,720 --> 02:11:07,600
It's better to think deeply

3908
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:08,920
Of course I can't be cruel

3909
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:10,000
I just answered everyone

3910
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,920
People say you do the math problems in the middle school

3911
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:12,960
to count that

3912
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:14,200
C What is the angle

3913
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:16,600
Although I think that kind of thinking is really useful

3914
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:17,360
Tired of thinking

3915
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:18,520
but useful

3916
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:19,360
but you play mahjong

3917
02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:21,320
You also have to fight with your high pole

3918
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:23,720
You're going to make a fool of yourself in three or two moves.

3919
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:24,840
you didn't use

3920
02:11:24,840 --> 02:11:25,760
you didn't think too much

3921
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:27,360
you won easily

3922
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:28,040
so

3923
02:11:28,040 --> 02:11:29,760
I think it's a very simple example

3924
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:30,480
what is thinking

3925
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:31,280
you have to

3926
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:32,640
you better be thoughtful or

3927
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:34,000
if it is true

3928
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,800
to think hard or

3929
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:37,600
not just good or thought

3930
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:39,080
or cranky

3931
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:40,400
that's not thinking

3932
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:42,360
So one can touch

3933
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:42,880
able to think

3934
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:44,120
play bridge

3935
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:45,360
this

3936
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:46,600
play mahjong in the afternoon

3937
02:11:46,600 --> 02:11:47,120
go online

3938
02:11:47,120 --> 02:11:49,120
In fact, many citizens

3939
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:49,720
all good

3940
02:11:49,720 --> 02:11:51,720
They said that Bajingsheng really has a doctor who also recommends that

3941
02:11:51,720 --> 02:11:52,840
playing the piano is no good

3942
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:53,160
Why

3943
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:55,040
This is rehabilitation of limbs

3944
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:57,040
Playing the piano is a good rehabilitation person

3945
02:11:57,040 --> 02:11:57,520
So that means

3946
02:11:57,560 --> 02:11:58,840
From these examples

3947
02:11:58,840 --> 02:11:59,640
that is

3948
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
make him move something

3949
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Let your mysterious place come alive

3950
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Suppose you have poor motor function

3951
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
you just go to exercise

3952
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Suppose you are thinking poorly

3953
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,000
just do your thinking

3954
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,000
That's it

3955
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,000
So he can still end up with the outside world

3956
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Just try to let him end with the outside world

3957
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
When it develops to a certain extent

3958
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,000
I think it just needs manpower

3959
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Share coolies

3960
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
That's it

3961
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Then I think the family Xiaode means

3962
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,000
just to take this

3963
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
just accept the reality

3964
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:34,000
you want to be

3965
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
a course of life

3966
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,000
that's it

3967
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:38,000
we were born

3968
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Our brain cells are dying

3969
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:42,000
But in fact we humans are

3970
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,000
deceased

3971
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
But from a healthier perspective

3972
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Now I'm going back to psychology

3973
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,000
is what matters

3974
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:51,000
So we should cherish and grasp the most

3975
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
When we are alive and healthy now

3976
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
conscious every day

3977
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
same life same thing

3978
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Really sometimes it depends on what people think

3979
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:03,400
The same thing, some people think he is very unfortunate

3980
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:04,680
some people are more optimistic

3981
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:07,000
I think you want to think about his good side

3982
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,440
He is a simple example

3983
02:13:08,440 --> 02:13:09,440
half a glass of water

3984
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:11,200
Some people say that there is half a cup of buns left

3985
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:13,000
Another person said it's ok and there's half a glass left

3986
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:17,400
That is to say, I feel grasped and fulfilled

3987
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:20,480
when we are healthy

3988
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:21,320
when my friend is clear

3989
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:23,480
Don't have any regrets after every day

3990
02:13:23,480 --> 02:13:26,880
I think this mentality is very important

3991
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:28,480
because we never know

3992
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:31,840
what will happen next day

3993
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:33,680
good that

3994
02:13:33,680 --> 02:13:35,480
there is a problem here

3995
02:13:35,480 --> 02:13:38,040
Ask Professor Lin

3996
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:40,000
What you just said needs to be deep

3997
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:43,080
Then the speed level can be

3998
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:44,080
you tell this i'll tell you

3999
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:45,200
besides

4000
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:46,200
I answer that speed now

4001
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:48,880
Otherwise I'm afraid I can't do anything

4002
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:51,200
There is a very important question in the study

4003
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:53,480
The faster you learn, the faster you forget

4004
02:13:53,480 --> 02:13:55,440
learn more slowly

4005
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:57,000
Because he has this consolidation

4006
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,000
You can talk about everything

4007
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:01,000
The rhythm keeps turning on my machine, everyone moves

4008
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,660
So his mysterious connection has been created

4009
02:14:02,660 --> 02:14:03,540
Mysterious recipe

4010
02:14:03,540 --> 02:14:06,900
The slower he learns, the slower he forgets

4011
02:14:06,900 --> 02:14:08,100
can operate longer

4012
02:14:08,100 --> 02:14:09,400
So the velocity is

4013
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:11,140
you see what your problem is

4014
02:14:11,140 --> 02:14:12,700
you really want to read read read read

4015
02:14:12,700 --> 02:14:14,300
He will use it, but it won't work

4016
02:14:14,300 --> 02:14:16,700
That's not the math one, is it?

4017
02:14:16,700 --> 02:14:18,260
spell that number

4018
02:14:18,260 --> 02:14:20,300
Oh you said accept

4019
02:14:20,300 --> 02:14:22,260
You said that was paid well

4020
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:24,260
I just wanted speed because I said it by the way

4021
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:26,700
So I said that many people go to learn speed

4022
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:28,400
think about it for yourself

4023
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:29,000
need or not

4024
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,600
I feel like I feel like I'm going to live to be almost sixty

4025
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:34,500
I don't think there is anything that requires me to read fast

4026
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:36,400
I was able to learn in my life

4027
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:37,500
i don't think so

4028
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:39,500
i can sell some reading

4029
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:41,500
But learned it very imitatively

4030
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:42,900
if i have to learn something

4031
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:43,500
so speed

4032
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:45,500
For example, it is really purely for exams

4033
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:48,000
But I don't feel the need

4034
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,800
i will really feel this way

4035
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:50,800
because when psychology arrives

4036
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:52,400
I tell us ACT academic results

4037
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:54,600
learn quickly forget quickly

4038
02:14:54,600 --> 02:14:55,800
you say that

4039
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:57,000
that's about math

4040
02:14:57,100 --> 02:14:59,000
For me, it is the study of mathematics

4041
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:00,000
just one two three

4042
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
you fight like this

4043
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:03,300
yes , like a lot of foreigners over there

4044
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:04,200
you keep watching

4045
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:07,400
Yes, you can think deeply

4046
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:08,400
this again

4047
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:10,400
If you feel like you're making a show soon

4048
02:15:10,400 --> 02:15:12,600
It's easy, then you don't think about it

4049
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:14,000
What kind of bottom pressure do you do

4050
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,400
yes, that's what i do

4051
02:15:15,400 --> 02:15:16,800
Really, this will

4052
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:18,600
is to pick a man to do it

4053
02:15:18,600 --> 02:15:19,800
So have you seen it all?

4054
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:22,400
because you can't say it's hard right away

4055
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:24,000
If you think you've reached this level

4056
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:25,800
You just go to the next one that is more difficult

4057
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:27,800
I think the one you can do is the next one

4058
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:29,000
That's it

4059
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:32,200
And this, psychologists still say it's very important

4060
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:33,800
I feel that when the ability is here

4061
02:15:33,800 --> 02:15:35,600
you want to tell you

4062
02:15:35,600 --> 02:15:36,600
Human power is here

4063
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:38,400
you have to target your

4064
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:39,800
young people are still here

4065
02:15:39,800 --> 02:15:41,400
Mainly for young people

4066
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:43,200
you want to set your goal here

4067
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:44,400
slightly higher

4068
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:46,400
But don't set it too high

4069
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:48,200
Because your ability is here, set here

4070
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:49,400
after your hard work

4071
02:15:49,400 --> 02:15:50,800
you will reach

4072
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:52,000
achieve your goal

4073
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,800
Then you will feel more accomplished

4074
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:54,800
Then after the standard

4075
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:56,500
you set your goals a little higher

4076
02:15:56,500 --> 02:15:58,200
My life is all the way, you always come here like this

4077
02:15:58,200 --> 02:15:59,400
I think I'm still like this

4078
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:00,100
you set it higher

4079
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,300
you try harder

4080
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:02,800
then you'll be more up to that standard

4081
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:04,800
you don't want your real ability here

4082
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:06,300
you set that standard there

4083
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:08,500
Then you will really work hard all your life

4084
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:10,700
So psychologists say to understand yourself

4085
02:16:10,700 --> 02:16:12,800
self-understanding is very important

4086
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,700
But you don't need to be so capable

4087
02:16:14,700 --> 02:16:15,700
you think i'm easy

4088
02:16:15,700 --> 02:16:17,100
I just wanted to say it

4089
02:16:17,100 --> 02:16:18,800
he will have a good time

4090
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:20,000
I have friends like this

4091
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,700
he really copes with his life

4092
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:22,800
life is easy

4093
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:23,800
but i just feel

4094
02:16:23,800 --> 02:16:25,800
It's a pity for the country and society

4095
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:27,000
because he can

4096
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,500
he can contribute more

4097
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:30,500
So the speed you said you would

4098
02:16:30,500 --> 02:16:32,500
make it harder again

4099
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:33,500
Progressive

4100
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:35,500
just to make you feel like you've thought about it

4101
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:37,500
Okay, thank you

4102
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:39,000
I ask you professor

4103
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:42,000
let's get away from that old man

4104
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,500
That means

4105
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:46,000
There is a saying in Taiwanese

4106
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:49,500
Very interesting to describe this time

4107
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:51,000
whoever despises you

4108
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,500
The sky is expensive

4109
02:16:52,500 --> 02:16:53,500
that way

4110
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:56,500
can you lead like this

4111
02:16:56,500 --> 02:16:58,500
no i don't know

4112
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Every time I talk about the past

4113
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Does that mean now

4114
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
the whole old will

4115
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
just say that

4116
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:12,000
will lose dozens of memories

4117
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
this this this square

4118
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
if nothing wrong

4119
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
So you say it and forget it

4120
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
if occasionally

4121
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
If it's like this often, he's wrong

4122
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Not all old people will be like this

4123
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
no

4124
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
he may be capable

4125
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Universality is a bit poor

4126
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
But I won't say it and forget it

4127
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Forget about it, you really can't clean it up in the morning

4128
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
That is to say, dozens of memories cannot be remembered.

4129
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
But it's been decades

4130
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
he can't remember

4131
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
That's because it's been decades

4132
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
The quality of the big guy is in the hard disk

4133
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
he can call out

4134
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Just started to lose real symptoms

4135
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
the vast majority are

4136
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
You tell him what he can't remember first

4137
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
It's not that you just told me that you were going to tell me yesterday

4138
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
I can't remember you telling him about the old days

4139
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
is the beginning of the loss of symptoms

4140
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
to the end

4141
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:00,880
I can't find the year

4142
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:03,040
That's why he gave his son and daughter no recognition

4143
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:03,840
yes

4144
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:04,440
is so

4145
02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:05,680
still have a question

4146
02:18:05,680 --> 02:18:06,720
ask the professor

4147
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:08,440
that is sometimes

4148
02:18:08,440 --> 02:18:09,760
even myself

4149
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:11,520
sometimes somewhere

4150
02:18:11,520 --> 02:18:13,640
For example in the AAA circle

4151
02:18:13,640 --> 02:18:15,920
I'm enjoying what I'm going to

4152
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:18,320
but go there

4153
02:18:18,320 --> 02:18:19,120
i want to take it out

4154
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:20,560
then what am i going to do

4155
02:18:20,560 --> 02:18:21,000
forget

4156
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,120
it's strange to forget

4157
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:26,800
Go back to this AAA circle

4158
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:27,760
just remember

4159
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:28,720
that's what happens

4160
02:18:28,720 --> 02:18:29,480
there is a Q

4161
02:18:29,480 --> 02:18:30,480
there is a clue

4162
02:18:30,480 --> 02:18:31,760
because this kind of thing is

4163
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:34,240
I think sometimes people nowadays are

4164
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:35,040
too busy

4165
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:36,600
too much distraction

4166
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:38,560
If this happens to you occasionally

4167
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:40,160
it doesn't matter

4168
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:41,920
But what often happens

4169
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:44,320
Especially you have to remember that those things are

4170
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:45,160
you often use

4171
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:47,160
Didn't you say save it on the hard drive

4172
02:18:47,160 --> 02:18:47,840
Need not

4173
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:49,480
things you use in your daily life

4174
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:52,200
But you often forget to say what you want

4175
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:53,320
often

4176
02:18:53,320 --> 02:18:56,280
something is wrong

4177
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:58,600
If it happens often, do you need to see a doctor?

4178
02:18:58,600 --> 02:18:59,960
i think you can

4179
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,440
You can forget to pull this off

4180
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:02,760
Because I'm not really a doctor

4181
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:03,920
I'm not very light

4182
02:19:04,100 --> 02:19:05,540
But there is something I will tell you

4183
02:19:05,700 --> 02:19:06,460
don't be so nervous

4184
02:19:06,620 --> 02:19:07,560
Some people often say that I just didn't know

4185
02:19:07,720 --> 02:19:08,600
where do i put my eyes

4186
02:19:08,760 --> 02:19:09,660
I didn't just put it here

4187
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:11,160
Why did I forget where to put it?

4188
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:13,120
That sometimes is not called forgetting

4189
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:14,080
you want

4190
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:15,760
have you ever remembered

4191
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:17,520
you forget

4192
02:19:17,680 --> 02:19:19,240
We usually put our glasses away

4193
02:19:19,400 --> 02:19:20,200
then do something else

4194
02:19:20,360 --> 02:19:21,560
you didn't even remember

4195
02:19:21,720 --> 02:19:22,920
you didn't tell me yourself

4196
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:25,360
I'm keeping an eye on it and I'm putting it here in my diary

4197
02:19:25,520 --> 02:19:26,800
then i go to do something else

4198
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:27,760
take it back

4199
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:29,520
no memory at all

4200
02:19:29,880 --> 02:19:30,360
did not remember

4201
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:31,120
it's a drop

4202
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:32,480
so you don't come when they can't find

4203
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:34,320
Some people go to match a messy entity

4204
02:19:34,480 --> 02:19:35,920
my eyes are silent

4205
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:37,480
I don't think this is very good either

4206
02:19:37,640 --> 02:19:40,080
Because the more you look like this, the real

4207
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:41,800
the less you think about where you put it

4208
02:19:41,960 --> 02:19:42,920
So next time you put

4209
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:44,000
one or two fixed places

4210
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:45,360
you know where i am

4211
02:19:45,520 --> 02:19:46,360
we know here

4212
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:48,000
next time you go there

4213
02:19:48,160 --> 02:19:50,040
If you put everything in those places

4214
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:51,560
You often use this eye

4215
02:19:51,720 --> 02:19:53,560
but you can't remember

4216
02:19:53,720 --> 02:19:55,520
It's going to be a little troublesome like this

4217
02:19:55,680 --> 02:19:57,120
that is to say, I have touched

4218
02:19:57,280 --> 02:19:58,040
I think it's time for a speech

4219
02:19:58,200 --> 02:19:58,760
The academic affairs associate said

4220
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:01,500
some he found in the fridge

4221
02:20:01,500 --> 02:20:02,500
No

4222
02:20:02,500 --> 02:20:04,400
He went to the refrigerator to get something

4223
02:20:04,400 --> 02:20:05,500
get a drink and go

4224
02:20:05,500 --> 02:20:06,400
change hands

4225
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:07,300
put your ice in

4226
02:20:07,300 --> 02:20:08,500
I think it's fun

4227
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:09,800
Of course you can't find it, right?

4228
02:20:09,800 --> 02:20:11,640
but you put it like this

4229
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:13,400
Actually, don't be afraid

4230
02:20:13,400 --> 02:20:14,500
it's not your memory

4231
02:20:14,500 --> 02:20:17,500
It's because you didn't remember him at all

4232
02:20:17,500 --> 02:20:19,900
something you want to remember

4233
02:20:19,900 --> 02:20:20,900
you forget

4234
02:20:20,900 --> 02:20:21,900
can't remember

4235
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:25,500
That's bad memory

4236
02:20:25,500 --> 02:20:26,500
Thank u

4237
02:20:26,500 --> 02:20:27,700
because of time

4238
02:20:27,700 --> 02:20:28,500
wait there is a problem

4239
02:20:28,500 --> 02:20:30,500
We can also ask again

4240
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:33,000
ask that professor li

4241
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
then i want to thank you all for coming

4242
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Because I still need to announce

4243
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,500
Our Knowledge Feast in June

4244

let's end then

4251
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:58,500
We are talking about something wrong in this game

4252
02:20:58,500 --> 02:20:59,500
can stay

4253
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:00,500
