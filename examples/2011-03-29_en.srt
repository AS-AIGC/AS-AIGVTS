1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
The strings are

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,000
just like the backdid new

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,600
and that's the place

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,600
where we call stone walking.

5
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,340
Yeah, you can follow

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,720
their walk using partright

7
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,480
here on your channel.

8
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,420
They won't accept

9
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,320
your cause,

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,720
but,

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,000
security means

12
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,820
you just have

13
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,160
cheek

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
good night friends

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm actually here to fight today.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Because it turned out that Vice President Wang Fansheng was going to preside over the

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But he just happened to be leaving the country.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So let me, a layman, do this as the moderator

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Today we are very happy to have invited researcher Zhang Zhenghua

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He's a researcher at our fish lab.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I just talked to him a little while ago and he has a very long history

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
All thirty years of researcher experience in Piscivora

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Researcher Zhang is currently a researcher of our Central Research Institute

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
is also a researcher in archeology at our Center for Human Design

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
About the CEO of Album Center

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He is also from the Department of Anthropology of Tsinghua University

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
adjunct professor combined

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Dr. Zhang graduated from Harvard University

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
just chatted

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I just found out when he was studying at Harvard

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm also building bridges

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This place in Maryland

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Although in the same city

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But I didn't know much at that time

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
so happy now

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I know Researcher Zhang also stayed at Harvard

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Teacher Zhang's expertise

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
in archaeology, of course

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
especially many recent

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Especially some archaeological ones under the waters

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This topic is very researched

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
His academic experience is very rich

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Then in our research

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,640
He also served as the deputy director of domestic research institutes

45
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,900
But he is the curator of the National Taiwan Museum of Prehistoric Culture

46
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,200
that one is in Taitung

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,960
i visited twice

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,200
is a very nice place

49
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,600
Well, I also held many important positions in this National Science Council.

50
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,800
Now he is also the director of Anthropology and Ethnology

51
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,700
chairman of the society

52
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,800
Chairman of the Chinese School Archeology Society

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,240
International Indo-China

54
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,100
The president of the Bhistory Association, etc.

55
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,900
So this academic manager is indeed very rich

56
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,000
Then I won the Contact Award from the National Science Council.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,540
This Wu Sanlian award and so on

58
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,800
so today we are happy

59
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,100
This can invite Dr. Zhang to come here

60
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,140
Tell us about the test results in the Taiwan waters

61
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,600
So today I'm here to host

62
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,700
feast of knowledge

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,500
Come to fill up once

64
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,760
I have presided over a lot of life sciences

65
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,700
rarely fully booked

66
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,600
I am very happy to have a warm state today

67
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,200
So we can also expect

68
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,300
his speech is rich

69
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,600
I heard he has 190 slides

70
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,400
so we have an hour and a half

71
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,200
see if he can finish

72
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Less time to ask questions if you don't finish speaking

73
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,000
We please warmly welcome our teacher Zhang

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Vice President Wang

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And our colleagues in the hospital

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and my friends

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Goodnight everybody

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I am honored today

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
it's not an honor

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's the courtyard that ordered me to speak

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I had to give orders

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
let's make a report

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
When I was asked to report

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I asked what topic I was talking about

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I consider

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Actually, I personally study archaeology.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
In fact, there are many topics that can be discussed

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Because of archeology, our specialty is to go to the mountains and go to the sea.

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So there are quite a lot of different themes.

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Later, I still chose this topic

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Because this topic is what we have been doing in recent years

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Moreover, it is actually a topic that has made substantial contributions to Taiwan.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Because Taiwan is surrounded by sea

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Taiwan is surrounded by sea

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But in this field, there was actually a blank in the past.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
almost blank

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So we compare these countries around us

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
In fact, a lot behind

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Our surroundings are like mainland Japan

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Shenger Philippines in Southeast Asia Vietnam in Thailand

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
They've done a lot of this

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But our Taiwan is a blank

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
None so it's a zero

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So in recent years this opportunity

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to take charge of such a job

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
In fact, I personally feel terrified on the one hand.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
On the other hand, I also feel that it is a sense of experimentation.

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I think

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,600
The vice president of our company in Academia Sinica just said that I have a long history

110
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
So here I think it is necessary to make some contributions to the country.

111
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,000
Otherwise, I'm just messing around here like that.

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,600
So I just like to talk about this topic today

113
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,200
I also want to share with all our guests

114
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Can come to share some of our work in recent years

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,400
Some preliminary results

116
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,600
Well, of course, maybe our poster is too beautiful.

117
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,600
So then we attract so much of our audience

118
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Ms. Huang, tell me the truth, give me an email saying

119
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,000
Wow, what is the full report this time?

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
Then I said oh, I'm surprised

121
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Because in the past, our archaeological topics were all very cold farts.

122
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,000
Then it is very difficult to have an audience for this audience.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
Then I go to class and study again.

124
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Probably the amount of inflation is two or three people or seven or eight people.

125
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Ah, so there are so many people saying 250 people, I was shocked again

126
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
I'm also very glad that everyone is interested. Of course it's great.

127
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,800
so so so so not much time today

128
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,000
uh yes

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,080
I prepared a lot of slides like this

130
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,320
But I know time is unlimited

131
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,280
So I deleted some

132
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,560
But I didn't notice that there are still so many

133
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,880
so i'll be soon

134
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,760
See how much you can talk like this

135
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,600
then this

136
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,360
So this underwater archeology

137
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,000
It's a word that sticks to this archeology

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,680
Therefore, in the common people's concept

139
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,840
In fact, archeology is digging in the ground.

140
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,520
So just dig down

141
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,880
is archeology

142
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,760
So the general idea is that terrestrial archaeology

143
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,440
So I seldom think of doing archaeology in waters

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,320
Well, so our archeology on land

145
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,000
In fact, up to millions of years

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,440
then until modern times

147
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,360
In fact, it is also a time when we do archaeology.

148
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,240
a category

149
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,920
so like this

150
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,560
Everyone is a stereotype like these

151
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,720
Those who go to archaeology are doing monuments.

152
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,340
Japan's this

153
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,560
some say

154
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,440
actually

155
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,920
Those people are reformers

156
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,000
But it turns out to be a post

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,080
then proof

158
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,780
And it's still kinda cool

159
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,900
That UNGYA special treasure

160
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,380
Anyway, look at it as a

161
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,620
just started coming out like that

162
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,120
show scene

163
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,080
a little small

164
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,120
kind of

165
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,340
prepare for seat

166
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,880
to find

167
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,700
will definitely come out later

168
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,900
promote can also

169
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,140
From this next

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
this maya this mexican

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,080
These Pyramids from Astic

172
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,600
and these things

173
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,200
In fact, Huang's bima swims

174
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,520
And these childlike, jade-like

175
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,720
these things

176
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,120
Well in fact

177
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,080
For the last forty or fifty years now

178
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,560
In fact, now everyone is starting to notice

179
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,080
In fact, archeology is not just on the road

180
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,680
actually in the water

181
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,360
In fact, there are many, many

182
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,400
Remnants of some human cultures

183
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,160
What about these remains?

184
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,880
its quantity its value

185
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,400
Definitely not faster than on land

186
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,160
Although there are pyramids on land

187
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,000
But there are also pyramids in the water

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,680
There are many precious things in the water

189
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,000
of these cultures

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,040
remains of human culture

191
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,880
its importance is very important

192
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,080
And all the waters of the earth

193
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,560
take up our entire planet

194
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,600
Three quarters of the earth is water

195
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,240
Only a quarter of the land is occupied by land

196
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,680
maritime

197
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,320
In fact, so in the sea

198
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,800
It can be said that it is a very colorful underwater world

199
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,840
So the ocean it doesn't just have

200
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,160
These are beautiful underwater style

201
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,400
Because of these coral reefs and so on

202
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,700
In fact, there are still a considerable number of these human cultural relics in the sea.

203
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,500
Of course, on the one hand, some of these relics were deliberately left behind by humans.

204
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:21,800
Some are sunk into the sea due to the rise or change of the water level.

205
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Of course, some of them entered by accident.

206
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Like a plane crash, the plane just fell into the sea, right?

207
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,600
So there are actually a lot of these things in our sea area

208
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,300
Then these things also need to do some archaeology

209
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,300
The so-called archeology is not an old treasure

210
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,100
It is a scientific and systematic way to do some research and a collection

211
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:52,300
So we actually have all kinds of relics of human culture from the sea

212
00:09:52,300 --> 00:10:00,800
Strange, this is a topic we are familiar with recently

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
overall climate change

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
climate warming

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
so one day

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This scenario may arise

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
look at these cities now

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Maybe in the sea in the future

219
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
if one day in the future

220
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It must be exciting to do underwater archaeology

221
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
you see this is a

222
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If the sea level rises two meters

223
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
this is new york

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
This is what a space in New York looks like

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So it's not really impossible

226
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
In the future these so-called legacies of humanity

227
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
These heritages that will become underwater in the future

228
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So underwater is actually a

229
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Implicit responsibilities, let's do some discussion

230
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So in this underwater heritage

231
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
In fact, there are various categories

232
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I just said there are buildings

233
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
city ​​with a past

234
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Carved castle with a past

235
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There are villages and towns

236
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But there's a whole lot more

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,640
what is p by boat

238
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,520
The number of boats is quite abundant

239
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,440
more than vietnam

240
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,440
This image is from Google Earth

241
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,480
each of these little blue dots

242
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,720
Just looking at the Earth from space

243
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,000
The ruins of these boats that can be seen

244
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,360
Of course, most of these boat rides are in shallow seas

245
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,760
or near the sea

246
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,200
So it can be seen that this shipwreck

247
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,520
after it marks it

248
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,760
you are everywhere

249
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,960
So this number can be said to be quite large

250
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,400
So of course there are more under the sea

251
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,040
can zoom in a bit

252
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,440
you can look at these

253
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,560
You see these are secret codes

254
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,040
not just in the sea

255
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,440
In land rivers and lakes

256
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,480
There are also many, many of these ancient boats

257
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,400
the most famous one by boat

258
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,520
Everybody knows

259
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,400
Do you all know each other?

260
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,520
Titanic Anne

261
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,440
At this time the most famous

262
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,120
The whole world probably talks about taking a boat

263
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
don't even mention this one

264
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So what about the city ship after the silence of 1912

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Then it exists in the North Atlantic Ocean below 3000 meters

266
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Then came 1985

267
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It was only discovered by this man's chest

268
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He came from this state of Massachusetts in the United States

269
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
a physicist

270
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Then he invented this underwater submersible

271
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
so go down in the water

272
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
To be able to capture this image of Titanic

273
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Of course this is a very famous city ship

274
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Well, of course his value is being discussed a lot now

275
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
because he was 1912

276
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
His age is close to 100 years from now

277
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
less than 100 years old

278
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So what is his worth?

279
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So now in the US, UK, France, Canada

280
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So he's debating what the hell to do with this city ship

281
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Of course many commercial businessmen

282
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
to salvage these things

283
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Because he has too many magical legends

284
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So I want to fish for the treasures inside and sell them.

285
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,200
do a business

286
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,000
But now in the United States they prevent such an act

287
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,200
He believes that this is still a very important cultural heritage of human beings

288
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
is a so-called memory

289
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,600
A very good historical memory of a human being

290
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,800
So we still have to find a way to legislate to protect this city ship

291
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
so so why

292
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:28,000
In fact, there are many cultural heritages of these human beings underwater.

293
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Many of them have very important historical or cultural values

294
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,200
But why did we not do archaeology in the water in the past?

295
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,000
The Pyramid we just saw

296
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
Egyptian pyramids

297
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,000
This Bi Meiying of Qin Shihuang

298
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,600
There are many other kinds on land

299
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,000
Why don't you go into the water and do archaeology?

300
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,600
right

301
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,000
In fact, you can't and you can't do it

302
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
In fact, humans have known for a long time that there are many treasures in the water

303
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
so he can't go down

304
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
because you mainly

305
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,200
everyone because we know

306
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,000
You hold your breath for two minutes and you're done.

307
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,900
So it's just not going down

308
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,600
In fact, human beings have been

309
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,000
Just a wish to dive into the water

310
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,200
look at this

311
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,300
We have recorded in these ancient documents in China

312
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,900
as early as when bluestone was yellow

313
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,600
He knew there was a roof in the water

314
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,700
Because the ancient Chinese especially the rulers

315
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,800
Very important to this top

316
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
able to get the top

317
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,000
represents one of his powers

318
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,800
become a real man

319
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,200
So he has the top of the Zhou Dynasty

320
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,000
Of course you need to use Sishui Zhaozhao

321
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,100
What about Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty?

322
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,000
his reign dome

323
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,500
he tops for some favorites

324
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,300
Divide the water

325
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,700
Got the top in this watershed

326
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,500
so they know the water has a lot of

327
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,700
something from the past is in it

328
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,300
so they want to find

329
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,500
What about the Greek philosopher?

330
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,000
What about Ariswold?

331
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
They also know the water

332
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,400
should go down and have a look

333
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,000
Why can't I go down?

334
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,120
can't we breathe in?

335
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,600
Immediately suffocated

336
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,680
so he therefore

337
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,920
he is very smart

338
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,640
He spoke of man's ability to turn bronze chests

339
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,600
Put a bronze iron cabinet into the water

340
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,920
Then people inside can go to the iron cabinet

341
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,000
It can use its residual air inside

342
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
can come and dive into the water

343
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,640
So this is a

344
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,160
These

345
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,320
look at this

346
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,320
Humans are missing from these two pictures from antiquity

347
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,200
I suddenly managed to go

348
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,280
that this

349
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,200
this from

350
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,960
From before the festival

351
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,680
Until Jingguo entered the Qian century

352
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,960
Just trying to get into the water

353
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,400
look at it this is fun

354
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,560
it uses this thing to put it inside

355
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,640
go into the water

356
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,960
This is also a cabinet

357
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,880
man inside through an air

358
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,680
then put the air in

359
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,120
then dive

360
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
then this is more fun

361
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,360
he uses a bucket

362
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,760
people inside

363
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,440
Do you see it

364
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
Then this hand is outside

365
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,160
he can pick up things in it

366
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,040
This is getting better and better

367
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,500
have some strange ideas

368
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
into the water to dive

369
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,000
this is a

370
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,000
this one came out

371
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,500
This is at 900BC

372
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,000
Humans want to use this method

373
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
animal skin

374
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,500
Then pipe it into the

375
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,000
it can see through the air of the skin

376
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
activities in the water

377
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
this is the same

378
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,500
You see it also uses the skin

379
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,000
then in this

380
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,500
It's in this Middle East

381
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,000
ancient mural above

382
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,500
accomplished

383
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,000
So what about the people at that time?

384
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He tried to get into the water

385
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
to dive

386
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm going to have a look

387
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
fished something

388
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Fishing for antiquities

389
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,500
or go see some

390
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,000
some other things

391
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
then this thing

392
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,500
what about this wish

393
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,000
By 1943

394
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
finally come true

395
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Anyone who knows how to dive now knows

396
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It is very important that the water fee

397
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Now divers will carry this on their backs

398
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It is what we usually call the water fee

399
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
it passes through an air

400
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,800
Oxygen level

401
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
Then pass through an air conditioner

402
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Then it can breathe in water

403
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
can move in water

404
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,300
And this kind of activity can be done freely

405
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,800
So this is a very important invention

406
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,600
this is by a french

407
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,000
this is the one this is his name

408
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,800
Jack Costow

409
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,000
such a he is a naval officer

410
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,400
He invented the water bill

411
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,800
So he realized this human

412
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,700
able to move underwater

413
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,000
such a dream of diving

414
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,800
So this is what he invented

415
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,200
Such a water fee with two buckets

416
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,400
Then the discovery of the water fee for this water

417
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,200
This human can go into the water

418
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,800
right

419
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
He can swim freely in the water

420
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,200
can stay for a while

421
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
can see what he wants to see

422
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,800
wants to get what he wants

423
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
then this

424
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,000
but this result

425
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
first one of his effects

426
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,900
that humans can find in water

427
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,300
some ancient cultures should

428
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Including ships, buildings, ruins and ancient relics, etc.

429
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It is free to discover these things

430
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But after discovering

431
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
become another side effect?

432
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Just started a treasure trove

433
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Everyone goes to the water to find treasure

434
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Because everyone knows that there are many treasures in the water

435
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So it has to go to the water to find treasure

436
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What about this loot?

437
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
still a lot of people

438
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Still thinking of fishing for treasure

439
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
that this is a recent event

440
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
that was in 2007

441
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
America's famous one in Furley

442
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
An ocean exploration company called Odyssey

443
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
it's this it's a very strong company

444
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What about its biggest task?

445
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Just go to sea to find these things

446
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Probe, find these undersea safeguards

447
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So it was in 2007 when

448
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
it's in this spanish in portuguese

449
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What about the big sunset in the south?

450
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
it found a boat

451
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
to detect an adult ship

452
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Then go down and do it

453
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,500
Lay it down

454
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,900
he hit the city ship

455
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,600
He named himself Black Swan

456
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,680
black swan

457
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,600
after black swan

458
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,480
Then this city ship is incredible

459
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,880
what do you see because of him

460
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,720
is a gold coin

461
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,200
right

462
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:10,980
gold

463
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,360
how many gold coins are in it

464
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,760
There are 500,000 gold coins

465
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,000
then this

466
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,680
how much does it add up to

467
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,720
There are 17 tons

468
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,320
So that's a big one-coin fortune

469
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,560
but it is

470
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,600
caught in the Atlantic

471
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,440
But its wealth caused

472
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,760
Protests in Spain

473
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,960
because spanish says

474
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,840
the boat

475
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,280
it's their boat

476
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,360
called mercedes

477
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,760
this is what they are

478
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,320
1804

479
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,200
when the british fought

480
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,960
a ship silent in the atlantic

481
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,920
This ship is sailing back to Spain from South America

482
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,160
Then there was silence in the middle

483
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,120
so they want to ask

484
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,360
This thing has to be returned to the devil

485
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,640
Spain

486
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,880
then this thing

487
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,840
of course until now

488
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,240
no big lawsuit for it yet

489
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,120
big lawsuit

490
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
during that period

491
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,640
this peru

492
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,460
Miru is also asking why

493
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,840
He said you shipped this thing from Miru

494
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,500
Then you were not unified by our Miru people

495
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,840
You're shipped to Spain

496
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,140
Spain just said it's not okay

497
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,620
Because you were my colony at the time

498
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,620
You are not a sovereign state yourself

499
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,020
so you have no right to ask

500
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,260
So now the lawsuit is still going on

501
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,220
This also involves American diplomacy and politics

502
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,100
Because the US government is supporting Spain

503
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,260
But this Audis company

504
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,300
He is a very powerful private

505
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,060
he is very powerful

506
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,780
so he found a lot of lawyers

507
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,140
then think american

508
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,020
Why don't you favor us Americans

509
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,220
to support Spain

510
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,580
So he thinks these American governments are a conspiracy

511
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,180
because of what

512
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,140
Because the US government wants to get a painting back from Spain

513
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,380
an ancient painting

514
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,720
so make an exchange

515
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,980
So it's in the middle so far

516
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,660
Some lawsuits are still pending

517
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,820
So this also shows

518
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,700
In fact underwater he is one of many of these ancient safeguards

519
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,620
So actually until now

520
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,260
everyone still wants

521
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,400
He wanted to catch these ancient humans in the water

522
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,200
legacy safeguards

523
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,600
so this thing has a lot of

524
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,400
until now

525
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,800
What I said is that we still have them in Taiwan.

526
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,000
many people who can dive

527
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,800
He wanted to fish for some ancient porcelain from the bottom of the sea

528
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,600
can be exchanged for money

529
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,600
So this has aroused some people's attention

530
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,000
because of this

531
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,800
Although there are many of these under the sea

532
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,200
But after these people kept going down to salvage

533
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,400
These things will all come to naught

534
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,800
They were all taken away by individuals

535
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,600
so therefore

536
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,200
The country I visited feels

537
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,800
we should make some laws

538
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,000
to protect these underwater

539
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,200
so-called cultural heritage

540
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,400
Then the UK first in 1973

541
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,800
That's 30 years after the water bill was invented in 1943

542
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,400
At the beginning, the United Kingdom established this traditional protection law

543
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,200
Just to protect these Chen Chuan

544
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Then his Chen Chuan

545
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,200
According to Chen Chuan's historical archaeological and artistic value

546
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,000
then want to specify

547
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
After the designation, the government will have power

548
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,920
to protect it

549
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,960
That is

550
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,040
that thing

551
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Well

552
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,480
then this

553
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,800
By 1982

554
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,560
What about the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea?

555
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,040
He also started to define this, this, this clause

556
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,480
It is to require that the protection of sea discoveries has cultural asset value

557
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,960
and items of historical value

558
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,520
it was 1982

559
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,080
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea

560
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,680
Also set such a

561
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,200
uh a law

562
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,080
then 1988

563
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,640
the International Law Association

564
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,280
ah

565
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,520
What about the IRA?

566
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,240
He also started noticing the problem

567
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,840
So he also planned to fry a draft convention on underwater cultural assets

568
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,920
he is the draft

569
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,080
ah

570
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,480
a draft

571
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,960
But it didn't turn into a formal

572
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,200
a law

573
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,840
Then in 1990

574
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,760
This international stock machine and a group of federations

575
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,680
This one is at Ecmo in Rome, Italy

576
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,120
Well he uh

577
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,960
in 1996

578
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,640
He also passed a current chapter called the Management of Underwater Cultural Assets Conservation

579
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,960
Charter on the protection and management of

580
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and the water culture heritage

581
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
then this is a

582
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
in 1990

583
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
There is a formal

584
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
There is such an international

585
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
protection of underwater heritage

586
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
such a chatter

587
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Then in 2001

588
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Finally our United Nations

589
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
He is passing a called

590
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I

591
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The UNESCO of the United Nations

592
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
UNESCO

593
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage

594
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So this is enough to see

595
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
What about this underwater?

596
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Actually very late

597
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
until recently

598
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
you see the 21st century

599
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and then slowly

600
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
everyone should pay attention

601
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
to protect these underwater

602
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
these human heritage

603
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
the unesco convention

604
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
After this mud

605
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Many countries cannot be consecutive

606
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
because it must have

607
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
After 20 countries in a row

608
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
This agreement will come into force

609
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
why

610
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
because like many countries

611
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
for self benefit

612
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
like just america

613
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The United States and other countries have many large consortia

614
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Specially on stage

615
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
after the treaty of interest

616
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
it's over

617
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,260
So the U.S. government has never dared to sign this

618
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,460
dare not sign

619
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,500
That's why I haven't been able to make up enough

620
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,260
Not enough to make up the number of this country

621
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,200
until January 2009

622
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,460
barely enough

623
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,540
has just come into effect

624
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,100
So now every country in the world

625
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,160
It wants to protect its underwater cultural heritage

626
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,700
must be subject to this convention

627
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,500
as a basis for it

628
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,800
So so according to this convention

629
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
So our underwater cultural heritage

630
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,000
What is probably the cultural heritage of hydration

631
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,400
it has a definition

632
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,000
Then he said underwater cultural heritage

633
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,900
it is partially or fully underwater

634
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,600
periodic or continuous existence

635
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,800
at least 100 years

636
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,200
Just 100 years ago

637
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,700
At the same time it has contained content that contains

638
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,800
Refers to building houses, handicrafts

639
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,000
human remains

640
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,200
and its archaeological and natural drama

641
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,800
The second is ships, aircraft

642
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,400
and other means of transport

643
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,600
or any part of the above three categories

644
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,500
goods or other items

645
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,700
archaeological and natural drama

646
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,100
prehistoric animals

647
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Then this is in the underwater heritage protection apartment of the United Nations

648
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
What are these defined underwater heritage

649
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Of course, like the cables we often use in our oceans now

650
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Some of these seabeds are still used

651
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Like the earthquake predictor we recently deployed off the coast of Yinan

652
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Of course this doesn't count because it's modern.

653
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
So in the past, if there were 100 years

654
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
These things probably need to be protected.

655
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
the heritage of these cultures

656
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Well, in this 100 years, there have been new political theories recently

657
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Especially just saw Katanic

658
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
After many people on the Katani went fishing

659
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Now it needs to be changed to a later date, about 50 years

660
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
can have the heritage of these cultures that need to be protected

661
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Well, the invention of the water fee except this

662
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
About fishing insurance involving underwater

663
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
In addition to the protection of underwater cultural heritage?

664
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
What about another effect?

665
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It is this archaeology that has emerged as a new field

666
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Because archeology in the past was all on land

667
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Archaeologists dig with shovels

668
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,960
But now archaeologists need to go into the water

669
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,640
That's why it's called underwater archaeology.

670
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,520
Well, underwater archeology didn't really appear until the 1960s.

671
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,520
This is an American archaeologist named George Bath

672
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,000
Well he's retired now

673
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,160
He is a professor at the University of Texas AMM in the United States

674
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,640
then he retired

675
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,840
I kept in touch with him until recently

676
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,000
He is considered the father of underwater archaeology

677
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,280
a founder

678
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,360
Well, he's first in the Turkish waters on the south side

679
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,240
called Cabidonia for underwater surveys

680
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,120
He's investigating East Rome

681
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,600
These are the city legends of the Byzantine period

682
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,280
Discover a wealth of these cultural relics from the Byzantine era

683
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,280
So for us to understand these Byzantine eras from the Eastern Roman era

684
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,440
The traffic of these past seas

685
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,040
The production of these trades at the time

686
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
Korean technology and so on

687
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,900
He provided some important

688
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,400
some new information

689
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,800
So this is considered a very important one

690
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,500
A job in underwater archeology

691
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,400
then this

692
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,800
This is where he was at the time

693
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,200
south coast of Türkiye

694
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,500
The archaeological work carried out

695
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,900
he is totally one

696
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,500
Here's what he collected for research

697
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,200
This map of this MAP

698
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,100
look at these wrecks found

699
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,500
So wait a minute

700
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,800
Well, he is using a very scientific method

701
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,900
to carry out underwater

702
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,100
instead of big fish

703
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,300
He is an underwater archaeologist

704
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,500
that is very systematic

705
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
From a scientific point of view?

706
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,100
to carry out underwater cultural relics?

707
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,500
to collect

708
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,600
record

709
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
to investigate

710
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,900
so so

711
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,200
Now we get into this underwater archeology

712
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,500
Because of this, after all, Taiwan has not

713
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,200
so i thought i would like to slightly

714
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,500
can introduce

715
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,900
What is underwater archaeology?

716
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,760
It's actually archaeology

717
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,600
It basically its principles and some of its methods

718
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,840
basically the same as archeology

719
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,040
But some of its tools use

720
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,560
the equipment it uses

721
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,960
Of course, the environment of archaeology on the road is different.

722
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,200
So therefore it's not the same as this

723
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,480
So underwater archeology it's all about combining diving equipment

724
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,120
and Ocean Exploration Technology

725
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,880
By investigating and discovering

726
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,720
Submerged ship ruins and relics, etc.

727
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,880
To study the history and culture of human beings in the past

728
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,200
So it's going to combine diving

729
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,640
and some marine exploration equipment

730
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,320
and other disciplines

731
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,240
Come and do these underwater

732
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,000
Relic and ship detection work

733
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,400
job found

734
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,040
So so as an underwater archaeologist

735
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,480
It's more complicated than this terrestrial archeology

736
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,240
It's road archeology is already complicated

737
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,520
But underwater archeology

738
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,560
The environment in which it works is inside the water

739
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,680
so it's more complicated

740
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,560
it has to be a team job

741
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,680
so it includes more than just archaeologists

742
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,200
Ocean explorer Marine engineer Historian Marine geologist

743
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,600
Ancient tomb maintenance scientists, communication personnel, diving workers, etc.

744
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,600
It is a teamwork, not a job that any individual can perform

745
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,600
This picture is a typical underwater archaeological work

746
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,600
You see there must be a working platform above the water

747
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,200
If the following archaeological excavations are carried out,

748
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,800
So it still has to follow the archaeological method

749
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,000
Some principles to do these archaeological work

750
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,800
Then all these unearthed cultural relics

751
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,400
It must be transported to the sea in a welfare bag like a welfare bag

752
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,600
it's a part job

753
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,200
Then go back and there are some unearthed cultural relics and some maintenance

754
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,800
Because the preservation environment of underwater cultural relics is very different from that on the road

755
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,200
Regardless of the water pressure, regardless of the environment of the water body

756
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,800
basically very different

757
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,760
So once things come out of the water

758
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,000
to be maintained immediately

759
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Otherwise it will be destroyed immediately

760
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
so therefore

761
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,760
This artifact is preserved in Underwater Archeology

762
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,000
is also a very important part

763
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,500
so so so

764
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,760
What about underwater archaeology?

765
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,760
It does more than just discover shipwrecks

766
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,400
or pick up the items

767
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,000
Instead, we need to use the context of underwater archaeological data

768
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,800
To study the human cultural legacy related to the ocean

769
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,800
including social economy political religion

770
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,000
Legacy at various levels

771
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
and its environmental factors

772
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It's an underwater archeology

773
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,500
So what about underwater archaeology?

774
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,000
it is very important

775
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,500
It is important in several ways

776
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,000
The first is of course an important cultural

777
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,500
What about underwater cultural relics?

778
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,500
It has quite a few assets that are an important cultural

779
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,000
why

780
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,500
Because these things are in the sea

781
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
It is a flotant

782
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,500
also by a frozen wave of time

783
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,000
Everything stops at that time

784
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,500
so anything in it

785
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,000
it can reflect

786
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,200
All the real conditions at that time

787
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,000
So therefore it is a very important cultural asset

788
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,800
At the same time, it certainly has very important academic research value

789
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:15,600
Because underwater remains often provide us with a lot in our archives

790
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,400
Some new information that was not there

791
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,200
These messages may not be in any mean documentation file

792
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,400
But it can exist in the remains of these substances unearthed from underwater

793
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,000
Can tell us a lot of various information

794
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,600
Including the agreement of the individual to that of the whole group

795
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,200
or from something tiny to a large group itself

796
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,800
These engineering techniques and so on

797
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,200
And the development of the entire history of human culture

798
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,800
It can often provide some very important information

799
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,000
In addition, of course, the underwater cultural heritage is now

800
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
It is also a very important tourist resource.

801
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,200
So now many countries are also developing underwater museums

802
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Like this mainland-like Three Gorges in Egypt

803
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,400
after it was flooded by the reservoir

804
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,800
Some are in the water and it builds an underwater museum

805
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
You can also go to the water to see

806
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
so it can attract a lot of these tourists

807
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Now also advocate this so-called diving tourism

808
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
There are some city ships that allow spectators to allow tourists to approach

809
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
you can go snorkeling at home

810
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Or diving can come close to these underwater

811
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
The remains of these fascinating ancient cultures

812
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It has also become a very important tourist resource

813
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
like our yap island in the pacific

814
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Saipan in the Taipei Ocean

815
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
These all look like this

816
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
These are very economically beneficial

817
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
such a benefit

818
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I thought I'd give a quick introduction to underwater archeology

819
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Underwater archaeology is actually the same method as land archaeology

820
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It also includes the collection of research information for the project

821
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Underwater archaeological investigation and excavation

822
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Finally, there is maintenance and placement of water cultural relics

823
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Also research interpretation presentation and publication

824
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Then this is as an underwater archeology

825
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Underwater archeology requires a very careful planning

826
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
These plans include its scope of purpose

827
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,400
Tactics, methods, cost of personnel, equipment, and laws

828
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,900
because it is a cultural asset

829
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:12,400
After entering, the water must comply with the legal norms

830
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,000
In addition, there is actually an ecological

831
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,600
Because underwater work cannot damage the existing underwater ecological environment

832
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,200
So these things have to go through a very careful planning

833
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,700
to be able to execute

834
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,400
So our regulations are quite strict

835
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,400
Now Taiwan we are firing you

836
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,200
Underwater Cultural Assets Preservation Act

837
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,000
This file will already fire one of your bills

838
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Currently still in the Executive Yuan

839
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,200
After the Executive Yuan passed it, it was called Soli Court

840
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,700
and then pass

841
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,900
So this is the collection of information

842
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,000
Well, underwater archeology is not just about going underwater.

843
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,900
Actually it requires a lot of related work

844
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,200
So it's a fairly labor-intensive

845
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,800
it needs to be dictated

846
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,600
Because many underwater messages are not necessarily given the file

847
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,000
Oral data instead

848
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,400
can tell us a lot about this

849
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,400
So local fishermen are like sailors

850
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,000
This kind of sailors, etc.

851
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
They will have a lot of information

852
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,400
Come tell us about the underwater

853
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
what they met i saw

854
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,800
some underwater remnants of some culture

855
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,800
like especially fishermen

856
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,000
he sometimes trawls

857
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,400
Or he, a fisherman's reconnaissance machine

858
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,800
You will find a lot of underwater

859
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,200
Target

860
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,600
Then he will record again

861
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,400
especially some shipwrecks

862
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,600
because he often trawls

863
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,200
broke his net

864
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,000
So fishermen hate the entrance

865
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,200
hate very much

866
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,600
So he'll just jot that down

867
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
So the next time he goes

868
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,900
don't go past that point

869
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,600
These points are often second to us

870
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,400
becomes an important

871
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
valuable information

872
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
because he told you there's something over there

873
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,700
he may be a shipwreck

874
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,600
maybe a big rock

875
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,600
But at least it's a potential target

876
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,400
Also some food information

877
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,400
This information contains archaeological information on these roads

878
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,000
because the boat is in the sea

879
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,560
Tend to be affected by the waves will be affected by some factors

880
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,120
Will bring some parts to land

881
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:10,520
There will be some ancient porcelain on the coast

882
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,440
or something on board

883
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,000
these things are some clues

884
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,360
So when we investigated Pongpo

885
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,800
These porcelains from the Yuan Dynasty can be found at the seaside

886
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,320
Tell us there must be these wrecks nearby

887
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,160
These shipwrecks are the ones we haven't found yet.

888
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,120
Or the past has been washed away by the waves

889
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,200
then this is a

890
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,400
In addition, of course, the information of Wenwen County is still very important.

891
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,320
We're going to start with some files

892
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,960
Find some clues from some historical documents

893
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,120
In addition, the geographical environment

894
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,440
Because of these places where the shipwreck

895
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,320
It is related to the geographical environment

896
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,960
near these are mountain peppers

897
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,000
There is a diving beach

898
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,360
Hazardous glue

899
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,360
these things

900
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,920
There are still very fluid in these environments

901
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,280
strong current

902
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,360
Ocean currents can cause these shipwrecks

903
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,400
produced by a place

904
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,200
So these data are very important to us

905
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:55,920
Then this as a look

906
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,080
This is after we use various information

907
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,640
Like our investigation in Penghu

908
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,120
Let's temporarily locate these possible potentials

909
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,000
some possible locations

910
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,600
Potential existence and existence

911
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,480
or this location of the submerged target

912
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,600
Then we are going to use this information

913
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,920
To do this underwater credible survey

914
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,880
investigation

915
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,520
vast sea

916
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,840
That needle in the haystack

917
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,400
We can't go to all the oceans

918
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,960
do the research

919
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,240
go to sea as a sister

920
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,280
When you go into the sea, you feel like a tree in the ocean

921
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,240
to the vast sea

922
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,880
My home is too small

923
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,880
then you have to do the research

924
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,760
how to do the investigation

925
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,400
right

926
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,440
Of course we're fine now

927
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,480
good technology now

928
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,800
So this underwater archaeological team

929
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,520
We'll include these experts in ocean exploration

930
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,160
Instruments that help exploit these detections

931
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,880
to help us discover some possible

932
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,000
some potential targets

933
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Now our most commonly used is SizeGain

934
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
SizeGain Zona

935
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Scanning Sodium

936
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
it uses a sound wave

937
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
This sonic instrument

938
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Come hit the ship from that

939
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and then reflect back

940
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
look at this sonic

941
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
to sonic

942
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Then found that there may be some

943
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
this target

944
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Another sound measurement system called polysonic

945
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Called MatiBing System

946
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
This is called the sound measuring system

947
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
This is also a principle of using a sound wave

948
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Of course it can find

949
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Some of the following possible targets

950
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
In addition, this Strata Instant Noodle Apparatus

951
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
叫Subbutton Provider

952
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
This Stratum Instant Noodle Apparatus uses this

953
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
use the seabed above

954
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Many of them were buried by the seabed and sea sand.

955
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
You only rely on these two instruments in front of you

956
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
dare not find it

957
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Because it's buried at a meter two meters

958
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
In the mud three meters below

959
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Therefore, you can use this Strata Instant Noodle Apparatus

960
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
can go deeper

961
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
to discover what's buried beneath the seabed

962
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
possible target

963
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,400
Unmanned remote control front distance

964
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
There's something this pretty deep

965
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,900
People still can't get down

966
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,600
At this time we can use this so-called ROV

967
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,800
Can use remote control

968
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
It's like a robot

969
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,400
You can remotely control the robot to do photography in the water

970
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,200
Now there is a more advanced

971
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,900
unmanned underwater vehicle

972
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,100
This is remote control

973
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,900
This doesn't even need a remote

974
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,000
just a robot

975
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,500
After entering, he can go by himself

976
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
to take pictures

977
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,600
so like that titanic

978
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,000
Basically use such a device

979
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,900
Go in and shoot to a depth of 3,000 meters

980
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,700
Some of the current status of the Titanic

981
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,900
There is also a magnetometer

982
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,800
This magnetometer is used

983
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,300
Targets mainly for these metals

984
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,600
to detect

985
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,400
Let's see the abnormal condition of its magnetism

986
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,300
to speculate that there may be targets in the ground

987
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,900
So these we can use the underwater positioning system

988
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,000
and Differential Global Positioning System

989
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
to define its scope

990
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
this target

991
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Then this is the instrument we use when we work

992
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
What about this part, our Academia Sinica team

993
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
we have some instruments

994
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
What about the other part of the instrument?

995
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Also with Sun Yat-Sen University School of Ocean Sciences

996
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
We have a combination of a team

997
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
let's do it together

998
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Like this is Mati Bing

999
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
This is Chief Executive Shengna

1000
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
This is this Bud, Subbottom Profiler

1001
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
This is the ROV, the unmanned submersible

1002
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So this basically looks like this

1003
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
We towed the instruments behind the boat

1004
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
and then trace

1005
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Let the above description be very systematic

1006
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
do this

1007
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So what is more advanced now is to use this

1008
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Someone

1009
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
A small submarine like this one can be built by a human

1010
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Of course it's a pity we don't have this in Taiwan

1011
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
then in the future

1012
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
when really needed

1013
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
maybe we hope

1014
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Of course it's expensive and expensive

1015
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
that part

1016
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
There is no such

1017
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Then when we do the investigation next time

1018
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Is it a random investigation?

1019
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
we are still very systematic

1020
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,560
Formed into these grades, these Fangke systems

1021
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
What can we do with this Fangke system?

1022
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,560
to do this sampling

1023
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,560
We can't do it everywhere

1024
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,560
We can do some sampling in the future

1025
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,060
do it do it do the research

1026
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,900
Then the other is us

1027
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,900
after discovery

1028
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,100
After the discovery of this series

1029
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,760
We still have to go down by our dive source

1030
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,560
Why

1031
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,200
Computers are still inferior to human brains

1032
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:22,800
right

1033
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,800
the computer will tell you

1034
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,100
There's a target down here

1035
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,600
but what is the target

1036
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
it won't tell you

1037
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,500
It just says there is an anomaly

1038
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,100
There is something abnormal and a signal appears

1039
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,000
then maybe a

1040
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,200
a rock

1041
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,500
maybe a shipwreck

1042
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,900
maybe a city wall

1043
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,200
This thing must rely on our divers

1044
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,700
go down and search

1045
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,300
It also needs to be very systematic.

1046
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,400
to conduct a survey like this

1047
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,100
It's not just wandering around the bottom

1048
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,900
then this is

1049
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,500
So there are various ways of investigating this

1050
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,600
including emergent

1051
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,100
like a linear

1052
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,100
These diving sources have been lined up

1053
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,100
such investigation or

1054
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,840
is corridor style

1055
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,240
Each person is responsible for a Cathedral and a corridor

1056
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,200
Or everyone in a circle

1057
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,280
Playing circles to do surveys

1058
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,200
There is a set of methods

1059
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,880
In addition we investigate

1060
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,520
Very important is this aerial and satellite photography

1061
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,320
Some of the information provided to us

1062
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,400
Now this technology is also very advanced

1063
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,840
Nearest Central University

1064
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,600
They also want to take advantage of this

1065
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,440
their space instruments

1066
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,560
to use the temperature

1067
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,000
Let's see if there are any unusual shipwrecks down there.

1068
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,440
Or these messages from underwater beings

1069
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,440
They are also experimenting with this part

1070
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,880
like this is

1071
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,680
This is in the Dongsha Islands

1072
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,480
Above Dongsha Atoll

1073
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,160
With this artificial satellite, you can image

1074
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,080
It can be seen that in the shallow sea part

1075
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,680
there are many, many of these

1076
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,920
The possible existence of this shipwreck
