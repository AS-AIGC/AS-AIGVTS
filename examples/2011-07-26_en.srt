1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
music

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,000
music

3
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,680
problem

4
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,240
ened

5
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,900
was

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,900
steals

7
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,440
circle

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,280
There is something important so he can't come

9
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,760
Entrust me to help him host

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,960
So I'm a layman on the subject of today's phenomenon

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,360
If you say something wrong, please don't take effect

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,840
Everyone knows that the feast of knowledge is very important to this feast

13
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,000
An important activity promoted by popular science knowledge

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,240
I just saw an official document today

15
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,880
The seventh feast of knowledge will gather and mature after the lecture

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,560
The seventh is also about to run

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,960
The first six are easily available at bookstores

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,840
or where to find

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,440
Welcome to go and have a look

20
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,680
All we invite are inside and outside the courtyard

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,320
very good experts

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,600
Come and talk to us about the latest scientific developments

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,280
we are very happy to have you today

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,000
Institute of Atomic and Molecular Research, Academia Sinica

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,040
The current director, Dr. Zhou Meiyin

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,640
Dr. Zhou came back from the United States in January this year

27
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,080
Join Academia Sinica

28
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,120
Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,600
Everyone knows that the Fate Institute is a very good fault of the Academia Sinica

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,400
Then it has a high status in the world

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,000
So today he is going to talk about the latest development of nanomaterials

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,400
Nano?

33
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,400
I only gradually heard the name in the late 1990s

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,400
I remember once in the Legislative Yuan there was a legislator

35
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,400
The nanometer plan sent by the National Science Council seems to be worth one billion

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,000
He said that this Taiwanese Penglai rice can't finish it

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,600
How much do you spend on Nano

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,200
so he is like me

39
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,400
It was the first time I came into contact with nano

40
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Nano NSA Program

41
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,600
Because I just remember people talking about Wikipedia

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,000
he didn't talk about nano

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,600
So I also talked to that legislator

44
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,000
that legislator is famous

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I won't say who this is now

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Then like him it was in the late 1990s

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,400
I just had a meeting and found out that there is this thing

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,200
Director Zhou graduated from the Department of Physics, National Taiwan University

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,000
In fact, I know that Director Zhou is already very famous in National Taiwan University.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
we have fantastic students

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He then went to the University of California

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Ph.D. in Physics from Berkeley

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Then in Exxon

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
do this postdoc

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Since 1989 in

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Georgia Tech Institute of Technology

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Professor of Physics

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
In 1998, he became a professor of politics

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Then from 2005 to 2010

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
former department head

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He was taken by us in January this year

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Come back to take charge of the camp

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Director and Special Forces Researcher

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Especially the head of the State Council

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The director's main research field is

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Solid-state physics theory and first-principles calculations

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Especially in the application of materials

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
director of incoming research

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
including various heels

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
nanosystem

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and solid scavenging materials

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He was in the internationally renowned

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Rehabilitation has published more than 100 academic papers

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Also had

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
country of america

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Science Foundation's President's Young Scholar Award

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and other important awards

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He is now a fellow of the American Physical Society

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And served as the chairman of the American Physical Society for the distribution of computational physics

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
As I just mentioned, since the 1990s

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Nano has become an important emerging field

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Many people, like me, thought that Nani and Penglaimi were the same thing in the 90s

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Now I think no one knows no one knows

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And become part of the textbooks of elementary school, middle school and high school

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This was unimaginable in our time

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
he is an elective

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
In the past 20 years in the development of nanoscience

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Carbon meter has a very important position

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The discovery and attention of carbon nanotubes, graphite, etc.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
is a very noteworthy thing

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Last year's Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to two scholars who made major breakthroughs in the study of graphite

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
two russian scholars

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
One of them came to the Central Plains to participate in the seminar shortly after winning the award

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
a very young man

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Master is an expert in nanomaterials

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,400
Today his topic is

97
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,800
carbon dimension official position

98
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Recent Developments in Nanomaterials

99
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I think this is a very interesting topic

100
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,800
The number of participants today is unprecedented

101
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Everyone, after listening today

102
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
It's just that nanometers are different from baked milk rice

103
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
We welcome the head of the seat

104
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
the baking problem

105
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,800
Thank you Vice President Wang

106
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Thank you all for coming to this evening's discussion

107
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
It's an honor to be with you all

108
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,800
A little bit about the latest developments

109
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,800
That's what Vice President Wang said

110
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Nano this field

111
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,800
It's been about the past ten or fifteen years

112
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,800
there's been a lot of progress

113
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
So what I want to introduce to you today

114
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,800
About the latest developments in nanomaterials

115
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Parts related to carbon

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I think in this speaker I have noticed that

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
we have some younger friends

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
There are also some who are doing some more senior

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
friend here

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So I think our speaker should not be too polite

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yes, if you think there is something wrong

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
raise your hand anytime

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Not much package

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Because in some places, if you don't make it clear

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Can it affect the following

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't mind saying that people want to be able to

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
straighten things out

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
so feel free to ask questions

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I think before we get to the subject

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because the topic is nanoscience with carbon

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I want to start with a quick introduction

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I think many of you have heard what nanoscience is

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So let's say I have a quick definition on my side

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That is, we hope to be able to discuss

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,220
Or control because it is manipulate

136
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,940
at 1 to 100 nm

137
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,780
properties in matter of this size or so

138
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,460
What about nanometers in our

139
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,940
In the more professional language

140
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,860
Nano is actually turned upside down

141
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,140
English is called Nano

142
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,300
so become nano

143
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,860
It is the power of time

144
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,860
So if we talk about a nano

145
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,220
It is the rice to the power of time multiplied by time

146
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,020
Nano means 100 centimeters

147
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,020
this size

148
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,020
at this length

149
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,020
It's a way you can imagine

150
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,620
it's a very very very small unit

151
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,820
Then in such a small place

152
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,020
Maybe we can see atoms

153
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,220
What about this length?

154
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,420
properties of objects

155
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,220
Many, many properties in the electronic properties

156
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,820
or mechanical properties

157
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,620
or optical properties

158
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,020
chemical properties

159
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,020
have basically changed

160
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,020
that so

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So in this case

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We can make some special definitions

163
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,500
or special study

164
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,000
OK let it go

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
sorry

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,500
OK, so let me give you an analogy first

167
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,000
I just felt what nanometer is called

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We can imagine that the earth is so big

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
OK then you have a small copper plate in your hand

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
OK, what about the two ratios?

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Like if say we shrink this down to

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,500
A word of 1 meter and 100 centimeters

173
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,000
Then this copper plate is called a nanometer

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So we all know how big a copper plate is

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We probably all know how big the earth is

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's their size difference

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So you would imagine saying

178
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
where scientists can say

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,500
from such a large unit

180
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
into such a small world

181
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,000
Then you can see something in it

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
to measure something

183
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes, I can say that it is not an easy thing

184
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You can imagine that on earth

185
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,500
Let's say we're an alien

186
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
an alien

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Come to Earth in a spaceship outside

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He wants to say you have a coin in your hand

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
He wants to see what kind of words are written on the copper plate above you

190
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,500
You imagine it's a very, very difficult thing to do

191
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,500
He must have some special tools

192
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,700
come down and see

193
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,000
actually see what's on that copper plate

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,500
What are we going to do now?

195
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,500
in a lab the size of ours now

196
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Able to enter a world of refugees

197
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,000
Then see how it arranges atoms one by one

198
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,500
Then it has some form

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
now this

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So this is our size above

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So how will our situation change?

202
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,500
This is a simple graph

203
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
because mainly

204
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Quantum Confinement

205
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,000
It's a quantum-bound problem

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That is to say, if you assume a thing

207
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Once restricted by the bureau

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
limited words

209
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
its nature will change

210
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You probably imagine a situation like this

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
For example, if in classical history

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Let's look at a particle

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
is a particle

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,760
It bumped and bumped and this side is sealed

215
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,900
We can see it running around like this in there

216
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,460
We can see a particle of this one object over there

217
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,760
But in physics we have what's called quantum particle physics

218
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,460
It doesn't matter if you haven't heard the term

219
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,700
I just want to mention the general things

220
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,760
That is to say, in quantum particle physics

221
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,960
a particle is not a particle

222
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,460
It's actually a fluctuating cold tree

223
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,620
And then when it fluctuates or is blocked in the middle

224
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,080
it will have different of these waveforms

225
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,880
Then each waveform represents that it has different energy

226
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,460
So this is a very, very superficial way of speaking.

227
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,720
Then I think everyone probably has an experience

228
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,920
For example, you've probably all seen a violin, a cello, or a guitar.

229
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,620
when you want to change the sound

230
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,620
You just change the length of the vibration of the string

231
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,180
right, according to different places

232
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,180
When the length is changed, its frequency changes

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
Above Quantum Law

234
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,880
its that frequency

235
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
The frequency of that wave content

236
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,720
is its energy

237
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,440
So if we put a direction

238
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,240
so restrict later

239
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,160
it has changed a lot

240
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,320
that when we are in this

241
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,120
What about the middle of this quantum confinement?

242
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,640
can have different limitations

243
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,600
For example, we usually

244
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,400
We are a three-dimensional space

245
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,960
then we are in a certain area

246
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,520
One direction confines it

247
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,680
We become a two-dimensional system

248
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,320
We call this two-dimensional nanomode

249
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,800
it is one piece

250
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,560
Nano means its thickness

251
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,440
It's about a few nanometers

252
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,880
Then if we say

253
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
If it is restricted in another direction

254
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,920
we'll see these

255
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,880
This is one-dimensional into nanowires

256
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,440
This has both directions restricted

257
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,520
If we are restricted in three directions

258
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,920
i become a thing

259
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,360
We are 0D

260
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,240
GLD

261
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,000
0-dimensional nanoparticles

262
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,200
In this case it's in our nanoscience

263
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,000
see different systems

264
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,500
Then steal them they will belong to one of these

265
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,900
from zero to one to two

266
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,200
What about the element carbon?

267
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
What I'll mention later is that

268
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,000
It actually has all three

269
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,200
We'll see zeros like this

270
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,800
this is a nanosphere

271
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,200
Carbon is made up of carbon

272
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,800
This is a nanometer carbon tube

273
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,400
Each is a carbon atom or a binary

274
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,600
This is the graphite west we want to mention today

275
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,700
The so-called Graphene

276
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,100
It is a dual system

277
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,000
That's so wait a minute we'll all be back to this

278
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,100
in each case i will mention

279
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,900
where are we in nanoscience

280
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,600
I want to clarify it again

281
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,600
because it is a basically an emerging

282
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,500
interdisciplinary science

283
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,800
Because whether in chemical physics or biomaterials science

284
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
There are many engineering disciplines

285
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,000
We are all slowly getting in touch with this aspect.

286
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,500
will also use some of the properties of nano

287
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,000
come and go on some of us

288
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,500
That is to say, to learn and explore some of its features

289
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,500
It has some emerging material properties

290
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
I probably want to wait for this

291
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,500
maybe mention an example or two

292
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
we study nanoscience

293
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,500
We also need to develop new measurement and control tools

294
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
into what I just said

295
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
we're going to a very small place

296
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,000
If you can measure something very accurately

297
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There are many tools that must be developed

298
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Then Nano can now also be applied to some

299
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
health care energy or electronics

300
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,560
Some technology and design above electronic science

301
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,760
these are in progress

302
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,720
Then usually we are in this nano

303
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,160
inside the field

304
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,320
very important also

305
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,160
it takes a lot of time

306
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,080
is to understand the interaction between matter

307
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,320
especially in such a small

308
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,440
in that length

309
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,200
What about this whole science?

310
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,200
still in development

311
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,360
We have several practical application strengths

312
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,000
wait might mention it

313
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,720
most research and development projects

314
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,200
still in progress

315
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,400
I think what you can expect is to say

316
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,040
The future is in five or ten years

317
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,600
You will continue to hear that

318
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,200
There are many new applications of nano

319
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,160
or nano

320
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,200
that emerging technology

321
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,920
in development

322
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So this is a very simple generalization

323
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
How will nanotechnology affect our lives?

324
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm just starting out here and I want to use a couple of examples

325
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
This is not directly related to the carbon we are talking about today.

326
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But I think there are a few more interesting situations

327
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The first one is to say that this is already being done

328
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
We all know that pitch first

329
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Everyone knows that you take a peach

330
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That surface is furry, isn't it?

331
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So for this thing, you drop a water on it

332
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
it won't stick

333
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The water turned into pieces and slipped away.

334
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Then we usually wear clothes

335
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
you go to something

336
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
have a drink

337
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What you are most afraid of is that the drink is spilled on you

338
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
then get naked

339
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
if there was a way to say something to you

340
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
As soon as these liquids are sprinkled on

341
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
become like this ball

342
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and then go away like this

343
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
won't get it wet

344
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
that's not a very good thing

345
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
If you sprinkle it, you will pat it

346
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
it just shoots and it goes away

347
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I wouldn't say that I stained that dress.

348
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So now there are some techniques that say

349
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
We can use 10 nanometer

350
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The carbon one that is so long

351
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
that little kind of fiber

352
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What about this kind of thing?

353
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It will be the same as the cotton fiber in our place

354
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
that is to say it fits together

355
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
In this way, on this surface

356
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
formed

357
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Like our pick a peach on the surface

358
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
that furry

359
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Except you can't see that furry now

360
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
because that thing is so small

361
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
In such a situation

362
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
it will generate say on this surface

363
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
those with some very small air

364
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
with those on these fibers

365
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
there will be one separated

366
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So when those liquids fell on top

367
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It turns into a ball like this

368
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
and you'll be gone

369
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,840
things already done

370
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,140
called fancy pants

371
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,740
This is called stain resistance

372
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,000
just won't stain

373
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,840
that's something that's been done now

374
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,640
Of course, what is the real principle behind the application here?

375
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,640
It’s just a lot of things that Lu Yuan can’t see now.

376
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,580
very small inside

377
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,940
carbon fiber

378
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,840
fibers that can be compared with cotton

379
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,440
can be held together tightly

380
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,880
Of course, this is what we want if we say

381
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Do many, many dives with a very powerful baggage machine

382
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,020
Then the surface will inevitably come off

383
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,880
slowly it will get wet

384
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,020
wet some of these features

385
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,580
The basic principle of this design is

386
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,420
is to imitate

387
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,920
the surface of our peach

388
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,580
Let's see if those fluffy ones can do it

389
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,020
man-made structures

390
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,680
What about another example?

391
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,780
This is probably now probably a

392
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,820
Compare a Vision of Yuancheng

393
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,980
hope it can be done

394
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That is to say, we take the very small particles of Nimi

395
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What we call Nano-crystal is a very small crystal

396
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The four particles of ordinary people are Cadence Selenite, which is a composite

397
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
it's very very it has some special properties

398
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That is to say, when it reaches very small particles

399
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
like we can follow its size

400
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Then it has different levels of different energies

401
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So in this is a photo just say

402
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
If we shine a light on it and it shines some ultraviolet light

403
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
after absorbing the light

404
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
it has different energy levels

405
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
so it shines

406
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The colors of these radiances are based on the difference in energy levels

407
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The years are determined by size

408
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So in this is an experiment just say

409
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,760
If placed in some agriculture

410
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,160
Then shine these dead lights

411
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,500
Then you will find that it has different colors

412
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,600
so according to the color

413
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,500
You know what size it is

414
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,500
That kind of example is very small

415
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,900
Now someone is thinking about saying

416
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,000
Because this thing can hear the human body

417
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,160
can penetrate many things in your studies

418
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,300
So and it superficially can

419
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,300
we can put some antibodies on it

420
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,300
put something that is not external

421
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,300
Then it can carry the body of this station

422
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,800
walk through school

423
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,300
that this is an experiment

424
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,300
Let's say it puts some

425
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,800
These antibodies antibody

426
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,300
It interacts with proteins emitted by certain IC packets

427
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
They serve the function

428
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,600
So after it enters the human body

429
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,300
it goes where it likes

430
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,300
with those proteins

431
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:59,300
When we take these little nanometers for example

432
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,800
to the female part of the animal

433
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,960
In the vicinity of inflammatory needle cancer cells

434
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
it just stays there

435
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,800
If so

436
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,300
If we shine another UV light outside

437
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,400
Then the light is absorbed by it

438
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,160
Then you start to shine over there

439
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,120
so this is an experiment

440
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,600
experiment with mice

441
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,800
Then it will also be able to detect

442
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,200
where the cancer cells are

443
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,160
So this is of course what to do in the future

444
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,800
Hope to use this technique

445
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,600
It can be said that there are these detections of this cancer

446
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,400
Tell me where the cancer cells started to grow

447
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,800
So of course it's a very long term one

448
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,800
hope to achieve something

449
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,000
Also this is

450
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,600
This is relatively new

451
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,200
a result of last year

452
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,600
That is what we call artificial skin

453
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,000
artificial skin

454
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
we shine in our skin

455
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,800
has a very important special function

456
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,200
that is

457
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You can feel it when you touch it

458
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,500
right

459
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,000
Because we feel pressure after we touch it

460
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So if say

461
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
We're going to take an artificial skin

462
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,500
you have to touch to put pressure

463
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
what about stress

464
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
to convey

465
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,000
words expressed by some signals

466
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
you have to amplify those signals

467
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and then with some current

468
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
convey it

469
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,500
So when people study and say

470
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,000
What to do when taking photos of these artificial skins

471
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,500
It actually uses some

472
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Zoomed out here are some rice noodles

473
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Here

474
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Because of rice noodle it has some functions

475
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,000
That is, it can be used as an electrolytic body

476
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
it amplifies a signal

477
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,500
So in a layer

478
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,000
It bought a lot of rice noodles

479
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,500
Then these artificial skins

480
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
it is very it can bend

481
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Then it can have a layer on top of that

482
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,000
something that detects stress

483
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and pass that signal down

484
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Then use this rice noodle

485
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Send out the signal of this current

486
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
so we know

487
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So measure the pressure everywhere

488
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
so this is a

489
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
can now

490
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,960
a situation that does

491
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,400
Then it needs that very low voltage to operate

492
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Sometimes you need other systems

493
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,840
May require a lot of voltage

494
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,000
so not ideal

495
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,200
So how many

496
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
There are several applications of this

497
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,300
after our course

498
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,300
I want to spend the next five to ten years

499
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,900
You will still hear a lot of new things coming out

500
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,400
OK

501
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:24,900
All right

502
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,800
ok now let's get back to the topic

503
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,000
Let's talk about the role that look plays in this nanoscience

504
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,600
OK

505
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,700
if you still

506
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,800
Probably everyone should have heard of the periodic table of the elements.

507
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,300
right

508
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,500
Look at the elements

509
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,300
Here

510
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,300
it is there

511
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,000
Its atomic sequence is six

512
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,200
There are twelve electrons

513
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,800
right

514
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,500
it's not a metal

515
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,600
It's right on top of the Sircum department

516
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,300
that they have the same

517
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,000
very similar electronic structure

518
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,900
There are many, many on our planet

519
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,100
inside our body

520
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
big pile

521
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,240
eat every day

522
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,260
fetal water compound

523
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,960
then physically

524
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,440
all those molecules

525
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,640
A lot of them contain fetal atoms

526
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,080
Then our entire organic chemistry

527
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,400
It's the fluid element

528
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,440
That 20% of the human body is actually fetal atoms

529
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,640
but the fetal atom it is a

530
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,000
kaleidoscopic elements

531
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,440
because it has many

532
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,000
it can do many, many things

533
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,640
We take the fetal atom out like this

534
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,840
put it together

535
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,000
It wants it to form very different images

536
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,240
Everyone knows the first diamond

537
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,240
diamond is tire

538
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,000
In fact, fetal element is in it

539
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,240
or stone wood

540
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,240
It's still the black one in the pencil

541
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,000
That's a tire

542
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,640
placenta

543
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,240
Those two are completely different situations

544
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,200
that's inside the nami structure

545
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,000
placenta will be formed

546
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I can even mention Naimi's carbon

547
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,700
it is spherical

548
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,500
or carbon nanotubes

549
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,800
And now the latest material

550
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
graphite west it is a flat

551
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
There are already two

552
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Liu Boer talked about a chemistry

553
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
carbon nanospheres

554
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,200
then one is physical

555
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,200
Said it was last year's graphite west

556
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,200
I'll put this over here later

557
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Let me talk about it a little bit

558
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
so our

559
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,800
now everyone's

560
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,500
just like that

561
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,200
What about carbon?

562
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,200
In fact, in our

563
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
that nano

564
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,700
Inside the Science of Nanotechnology

565
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
actually very very important

566
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,700
Member of Parliament

567
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,200
then let's go back first

568
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
look at this

569
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,700
diamond and graphite

570
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,200
let's get to know

571
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
it is at

572
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,700
our kind

573
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,700
before going to nano

574
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,200
what kind of properties will it have

575
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,700
If you have taken chemistry in high school

576
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,700
I don't think anyone is unfamiliar with this

577
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,700
because in carbon

578
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
we usually talk about that

579
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,800
when the electronic structure

580
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,600
We have two different energy levels

581
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,640
Then this is our tree feather

582
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,000
Then there are 2S and 2P

583
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,240
An A4 and P

584
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,040
two different tracks

585
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,200
that in its ground state

586
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,840
The ground state is the lowest energy situation

587
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,080
We have to consider four electrons outside

588
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,080
So these two are in the track of A4

589
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,680
The remaining two are in the P orbital

590
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,120
So this is the lowest energy

591
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,280
But since the two are quite close

592
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,360
so sometimes

593
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,520
it goes to a higher level

594
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,360
a comparatively excited state

595
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,520
Then move the electron up again

596
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,720
One on A4 and three on P

597
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,920
So in this case

598
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,320
the two of them will

599
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,560
probably mixed up

600
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,760
we are called

601
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,560
In chemistry it is called hybridization

602
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,360
put the two together

603
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,080
that becomes four together

604
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,320
called SP3

605
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,960
if four together

606
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
If we paint this out

607
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,240
A4 is usually a spherical

608
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,240
It is directional, up, down, left, right, front, back

609
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,000
So when added together like this

610
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
The hybrid orbiton of sp3 has a directionality

611
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,300
Then this directionality means

612
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,840
There are four outside the middle one

613
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,000
So if this is the case

614
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,640
In the formation of the structure of most so-called diamonds

615
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,440
That is to say, any climbing atom

616
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,640
There are four climbing atoms nearby

617
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,600
Then this structure is a very, very stable

618
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
then very very

619
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,740
That is to say, it will not be accepted by outsiders

620
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,240
a structure of interference

621
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,000
that's very very strong

622
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,240
That kind of chemistry is made up here

623
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,340
the structure like this

624
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,200
That is, it is in our visible light

625
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,600
It does not absorb visible light

626
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,540
So let's say we see transparent diamonds

627
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,140
and then the whole thing is very, very hard

628
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,740
because it's hard to compress it

629
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,500
so it's just

630
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,640
Because of its arrangement

631
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,700
and because of it this

632
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,940
the number of electrons it has

633
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
and decided to say that a physical property of it like this

634
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,600
of course this

635
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,200
This is the distance between its atomic rulers

636
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,400
Of course it's small

637
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,200
Also on the Nano side

638
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Calculated in temperature nanometers

639
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,800
so this is in

640
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,600
Because of this arrangement

641
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,200
Put Taiyuan Quality Sauce Together

642
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,800
it turns into a diamond

643
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,600
If we say we are too primitive

644
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,200
another arrangement

645
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,400
becomes

646
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,600
turned into stone membrane

647
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
become the stuff in our pencils

648
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,200
Also Taiyuan

649
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,000
But what?

650
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,200
We when we got to this house to stimulate the tires

651
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,000
i don't take it all

652
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,200
Three plus three and four all put together

653
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,600
I take the top and take two

654
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,000
Take one here and turn it into SP2

655
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
Then leave the other one there

656
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
no matter where it is placed

657
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,800
It does not interact with others by itself

658
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,000
If you make it like this

659
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,400
SP2 is an S is an original

660
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,500
What about the other two P's?

661
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,000
One is horizontal and the other is heavy

662
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,200
So to combine it becomes one

663
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,400
called sp2 becomes an angle of 120 degrees

664
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,960
so it you turn things 120 degrees

665
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,200
Then line up the words

666
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,000
It's a Ginger like this

667
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,200
It has three per atom

668
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,400
it's in the booth atom it to the neighborhood

669
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,600
Then they form an angle of 120 degrees

670
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,800
a plane like this

671
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,200
line it up

672
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,200
Because we live in a three-dimensional space

673
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,000
So all matter is three-dimensional

674
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,600
If they are lined up, they will become the graphite kilometer stars we are talking about.

675
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
In fact, there are stalls inside

676
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
everything is the same

677
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,000
So the complete foundation is built according to its arrangement

678
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,600
Its electronic structure will be different

679
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,600
And on this plane

680
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,400
Its layer-by-layer effects are very weak

681
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,200
Most of the strong action is on this plane

682
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,200
So it's a very soft thing

683
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,000
We can use it as kilometers

684
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
you write on paper

685
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
why does it get out on paper

686
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,640
Because the relationship between them is too light

687
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,040
So the layers will peel off

688
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,640
That's why it has properties like this

689
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,360
This is what we see in these

690
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,840
matter that existed

691
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,120
something in nature

692
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,400
That's the nano world

693
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,320
we have to make it

694
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,920
Rearrange these electrons from scratch

695
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,520
The only possibility is

696
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,520
The whole nature has only two kinds

697
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,440
SP2 is arranged in a plane like this

698
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,760
Or like that diamond we just saw

699
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,840
This is an arrangement of measurements

700
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,480
In fact, only these two

701
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,840
So let's say that in this

702
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,480
throughout the development

703
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,240
Now this is 1996

704
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,440
in the lab

705
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,480
there are three scientists

706
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,880
They made a new one

707
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,740
The quest for materials called nanometers

708
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,580
basically

709
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,580
take sixty atoms

710
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,740
put it together

711
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,580
Then form a structure

712
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,420
like a ball like this

713
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,660
The so-called Buddy ball

714
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,660
what about this thing

715
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,260
the football we all know

716
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,740
Take a football and have a look

717
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,420
it's the exact same thing

718
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,340
We are at this time when everyone is doing football

719
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,380
have found that

720
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,180
This way you can make a spherical thing

721
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,660
let's look at this thing

722
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,540
you will find that say

723
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,020
how to see it here

724
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,580
This side is a hexagon

725
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,420
That black place is a pentagon

726
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,380
Then each dot is a bomb atom

727
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,820
So for any bomb atom

728
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,860
it has three bomb atoms next to it

729
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,540
Live because

730
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,780
flat time

731
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,980
each is three

732
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,980
So everyone is equal

733
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,020
when you hear this

734
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,140
if i were to bend it down

735
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,460
i must have a place

736
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,700
less than six

737
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,060
so just

738
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,300
It's all pentagonal

739
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,200
so you can go back and get

740
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,460
If you are interested, you can take a picture yourself

741
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,100
this is a quest

742
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,700
then at this time

743
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,260
When everyone is doing it in the lab

744
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,360
It's just a picture bar that puts a bunch of suns together

745
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,000
formed between them

746
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,360
found a special structure like this

747
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,460
Then a structure like this is a new form

748
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,800
Because everyone thinks that

749
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,360
we never saw this thing

750
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,100
Thought we made it in the lab

751
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,760
This was in the 90s

752
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,700
By the time of 2000, two thousand years

753
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,060
There are many, many applications

754
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,260
You have done a lot of research

755
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,500
that last year

756
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,720
only found out in astronomy school

757
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,260
Possibly far, far away in outer space

758
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,660
inside these nebulae

759
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,100
Discovery of a nebula 6,000 light-years away

760
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,020
Maybe something like this already existed at that time

761
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,760
That's why I found out

762
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,920
This stuff maybe not that we hear

763
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,600
first made

764
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,100
a structure like this

765
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,800
What kind of a property will there be

766
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,200
why they won the nobel prize

767
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,600
to make something like this

768
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,600
because yes it is very very

769
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,200
very very strong first time

770
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,800
Because these chemical circles are not easily broken

771
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,900
So basically the ball is very stable

772
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,400
very stable ball

773
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,100
Ordinary people please imagine

774
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,600
This surface can attach some

775
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,900
many other things

776
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,100
For example, the molecules of some drugs

777
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,300
can put it on top

778
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,500
Then everyone was imagining at that time that

779
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,900
I can put this thing in my studies

780
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,900
It can take things to where you tell it to deliver

781
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,600
because this is small

782
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,900
it doesn't work with anything else

783
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,700
Then it might be able to cross those cell membranes

784
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,100
or some places

785
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,000
So for something like this is equal to a unit

786
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,300
we can bring

787
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,500
Just say Manupay

788
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,200
use it to do

789
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,800
do something

790
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,620
That is about after this discovery

791
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,960
late 90's

792
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,460
or 10 years ago

793
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,620
That stuff is pretty, really hot

794
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,900
everyone told him

795
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,860
this is a new thing

796
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,220
we all have to think about it

797
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,420
what kind of that thing can we use

798
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,180
It can be found that it has some functions

799
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,020
or for special applications

800
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,180
so this is the first

801
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:31,180
Judgment-related refugee structure

802
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,140
what about later

803
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,340
Next step

804
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,820
What we found was that

805
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,540
We can use the structure just like that

806
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,980
not make a ball

807
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,860
i can make him a pipe

808
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,140
roll it up

809
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,500
make a pipe

810
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,060
When making pipes like this

811
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,220
depends on how you roll

812
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,620
have different directions

813
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,660
So after that we have some terms

814
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,660
this is called

815
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,660
pull towards CZAC like a chair

816
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
That is to say, in a different direction

817
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
their nature will be different

818
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
some will be semiconductor

819
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Some will be very conductive

820
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So if say we take a

821
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
A carbon nanotube

822
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And what about these

823
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It can go to the surface to absorb some

824
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
other molecules

825
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Then we can go and measure these conductivities

826
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Then those molecules change the conductivity

827
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
So these carbon nanotubes

828
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
can become a

829
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
become a sensor

830
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
That is to say very sensitive

831
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
some can go to measure some

832
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
A tool for other molecules

833
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and at the same time

834
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
We also made some

835
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Flight Panel Display

836
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
The screen you made

837
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Everyone has to make it thinner and thinner

838
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Then use less power

839
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
What about carbon tubes?

840
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's actually a good material

841
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
it can be released in some of the

842
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,400
The release of electrons under voltage has many effects

843
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,340
It is said that some electronic companies are already making such products

844
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,960
So this has only had two covers in the past

845
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,920
This is our first science magazine

846
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:20,320
Usually there are many, many articles about these stamina probes for a while

847
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,960
So this was probably before this 2010

848
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,840
to every scientific federation

849
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,720
Lots and lots of discussion about this material

850
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,600
These are the words that probably speak to us

851
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,320
It's already the first wave

852
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:50,480
In 2006 five or six years ago

853
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
Everyone started to find out

854
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,320
In addition, there is another thing

855
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,080
This is what I've been looking for

856
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,400
The so-called graphite west

857
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,640
This piece of stuff is taken out of the graphite

858
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,400
Then it will be a very good two-dimensional nanostructure

859
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,080
That's because it's only one atom thick

860
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:18,180
So if other probes that we see like this nano

861
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,420
or probe

862
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,160
In fact, it is to take this part to roll up

863
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,720
or wrap it up like this

864
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,680
Or we take layer by layer what we call graphite

865
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,000
So this is something that people are looking for

866
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,960
Probably hope to be able to separate it

867
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,320
Then I hope to be able to use it for another goal I want to achieve

868
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,160
Then we call a structure like this Graphene

869
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,280
As far as graphite is concerned, it has SP2 as we just mentioned

870
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,280
So the angle of each of them is 120 degrees

871
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,840
Remind me like this again

872
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,440
The Graphite West Phenomenon Since 2004

873
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,080
Everyone has the first article introduction

874
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,760
For example, say that I can do this

875
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,360
This is the paper that everyone will publish in the future

876
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,200
Papers published worldwide

877
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,960
So you can see that this increase is unwilling to rise

878
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,400
So this trend is pretty pretty amazing

879
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,840
this paper daily paper

880
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,760
You can imagine that there are many students

881
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,680
Or a researcher working in a lab for a few months

882
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,760
Then take this result and write it out

883
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,840
I finally wrote a paper

884
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,960
In the past few years has been in this

885
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,480
This is a Xinjiang with more than a few thousand

886
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,320
Eight thousand papers have come out

887
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,480
But many, many people from different fields

888
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,200
all wanting to find in it says

889
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,680
there's something in here

890
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,680
We can research and use it on my topic

891
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,080
So throughout the development

892
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,760
in a column

893
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,840
He just said something like this

894
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,120
他說Graphic Mentor to be Lady Gaga of Materials

895
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,120
say that for the material

896
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,040
it's possible

897
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's a goddess, everyone knows why

898
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
like this he said

899
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
seems to be from

900
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It seems to come from nowhere

901
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
He came out of nowhere

902
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Then

903
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
everyone is talking about him

904
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Then what

905
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
not long

906
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
He is going to be absolutely everywhere

907
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
you are not eating

908
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
see him everywhere

909
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
so we all the world

910
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I see this news everywhere

911
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So for now

912
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
This is a

913
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
That is to say, many, many researchers

914
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
found some special

915
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
special subject

916
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
the whole

917
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
the whole trend

918
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
The whole phenomenon started in 2004

919
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
that's the first paper

920
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
these two

921
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
is now the first two

922
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
The first two were taken later

923
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
These two Nobel Prize winners

924
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
British scientists

925
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Then this place this article

926
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
is talking

927
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
This thing is actually a transistor thing

928
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
他說atomic to the thing carbon films

929
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
everyone understands this

930
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
which means it's very, very thin

931
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It is a two-dimensional thin film

932
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
He said he separated it

933
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Why can't I get it?

934
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
That's mainly because it mentions one thing here

935
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That is to say, this article confirms that

936
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
We can use it as a material for transistors

937
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Everyone knows that transistors are a very important

938
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
on electronic circle

939
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
important things

940
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I'll talk about it later

941
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Why do you think this is

942
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Will do transistor material

943
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
will be so so so important

944
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Then it is here to say

945
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
they found out

946
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
This can be used as a feel effect transistor

947
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Then it can be used with

948
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It can do some switch

949
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
that is, the one that changes it

950
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
The thing that replaces the charged particles inside

951
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
can have a great function

952
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
and the reason it won the prize

953
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
because it

954
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,600
Can be equal to a new field of innovation

955
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,560
they mean

956
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,240
words displayed

957
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,600
This thing has big, big potential

958
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,700
Then they are the first to be able to

959
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,740
able to make the first measurement

960
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,640
It's actually a very, very simple experiment.

961
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,500
Everyone thinks that physicists need very complicated and complicated instruments to do experiments.

962
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,200
or to do

963
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,100
In this experiment it is actually very simple

964
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,400
That is to say, after this article comes out

965
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,600
In fact, many, many laboratories can

966
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,900
do this next

967
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:43,700
In fact, this lab in many schools

968
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,800
also started to be able to make it out

969
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,000
Because the procedure in this lab is actually very simple

970
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,600
Of course now slowly everyone wants to take that

971
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,500
The system is getting cleaner

972
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,000
there is a new way

973
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,500
OK

974
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,800
Then see the dashboard

975
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,960
Before I get to the following

976
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
because how to do this experiment

977
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,460
This is a very interesting phenomenon

978
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:13,300
I usually show this to my students, which means

979
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,200
It will tell you how to do it on YouTube

980
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,160
So what he did was simple

981
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,800
get one of your tapes

982
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,600
then you take a

983
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,360
Pick out that pencil heart

984
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,560
on top of the tape

985
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,160
You know the pencil has many, many, many layers in its heart

986
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,560
Every floor is very close

987
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,860
usually you take a small one

988
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:40,260
There are about a few million layers in mm

989
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,560
But it doesn't matter, he just uses tape like this

990
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,360
don't want to be like

991
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,660
inone to stick together and separate

992
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,960
He is like saying that I have split several layers

993
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,860
look like this

994
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,460
really really really they do it

995
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,660
can do some measurements

996
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,960
it's not fake

997
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,460
So he breaks up and repeats it several times

998
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,460
Every time he weighs it

999
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Make it thinner without touching it once

1000
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
at the end

1001
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It takes a piece of Silicon

1002
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It's like something we use to make the bottom

1003
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
put this thing on it

1004
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
scrape it off

1005
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
spread to the surface

1006
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Then if you find the thinnest layer

1007
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
The thinnest seems to be very close to transparent

1008
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
very thin very thin on top

1009
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
then remove

1010
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
There is a little bit when it is removed like this

1011
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
will stick to it

1012
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
then put this thing

1013
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
get an optical microscope

1014
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
it's more complicated

1015
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
This family does not have

1016
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
to light microscope

1017
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
then go to

1018
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Find an assistant for every college student in school

1019
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
you can find

1020
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
then just look for it

1021
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Here is a thin

1022
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Can't see clearly

1023
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
because it's here

1024
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
it seems to be transparent

1025
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
It seems that this place is opaque

1026
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
then carefully measure

1027
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
That's one or two layers

1028
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
shixi is there

1029
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
So this is

1030
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
when this thing comes out

1031
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Everyone thinks I can do it right now

1032
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,400
I'll be able to take some measurements right away

1033
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,040
So everyone this is a

1034
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,560
It's like saying that it's a rare opportunity to say

1035
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,560
you can produce these things

1036
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,760
At the beginning, these two people did this because they

1037
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,640
to measure and they speak in Double

1038
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,040
so

1039
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,440
ok now

1040
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,240
Why

1041
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,320
This is a

1042
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,840
an important breakthrough

1043
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,600
Because it seems so simple

1044
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,760
one by one

1045
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,760
one slice

1046
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,400
A membrane of a nanometer

1047
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,040
something amazing

1048
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,880
That's mainly because

1049
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
in our electronics industry

1050
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,920
everyone has heard

1051
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,480
Selick

1052
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,080
All our iPhones

1053
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,520
everything inside the computer

1054
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,720
now everything is

1055
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:41,880
made with fine

1056
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,120
That's an entire industry

1057
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,440
since 1948

1058
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:46,880
Then

1059
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,560
These transistors are

1060
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,880
was found out

1061
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,760
invented

1062
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,760
1948

1063
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,720
Then what

1064
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,880
we were

1065
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:55,880
selected

1066
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,880
The elements of drama are those of us

1067
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,080
these enemies

1068
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,000
so we had

1069
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Single Crystal is a single catty system

1070
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,500
principle we start mass manufacturing

1071
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,160
Then this happened

1072
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,000
invented these commercial

1073
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
This is Pian Junking

1074
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Some form of these transistors

1075
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,500
and then in the next

1076
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,700
Birth of the collective line 1958

1077
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,660
It was many years ago

1078
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,000
But after this collective circuit is produced in this way,

1079
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,800
we can mass

1080
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,500
make things more and more complicated

1081
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,500
and then the features get better and better

1082
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,300
everybody knows

1083
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,800
Then around 1965

1084
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,800
There was a man named Gordon Moore

1085
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,300
He made a statement

1086
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,300
That is to say, he saw

1087
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,300
The development of the whole manufacturing industry

1088
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,300
Then he predicted

1089
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,300
us transistors

1090
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,300
Or these processors will get better and better

1091
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,300
Then his development trend is to say

1092
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:54,300
We are on a CPU in a

1093
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,300
What are those on the component called?

1094
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,300
Number of transistors

1095
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,300
U.S.

1096
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It is estimated that it will double every two years

1097
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,600
doubles every two years

1098
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,800
So it was painted from 1971 to 2001

1099
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,000
This is the number of our transistors

1100
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,400
You take one of our internal GPUs

1101
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,400
Inside the Central Process Unit

1102
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,400
The number of transistors on your

1103
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,000
I can probably see it from behind. I can't see clearly

1104
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
This is Painting 4

1105
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Everyone remembers that in 2001

1106
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Painting 4 probably has

1107
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
It's about 10 million here

1108
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Thousands of transistors are on it

1109
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
on the latest computer

1110
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
You see Painting 4

1111
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
The value of your computer has already arrived

1112
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
A, say, a billion transistors on top of

1113
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So so many transistors have to be placed on it

1114
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Each must be functioning normally

1115
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
your computer will be accurate

1116
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
no problem

1117
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
So in this situation

1118
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
You can find this thing is

1119
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Getting smaller and smaller

1120
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,760
And what about this line

1121
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,700
It is a

1122
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,720
our side is

1123
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,760
is not a Linear

1124
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,760
is a Lock-Rismick

1125
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,160
It's that Lock-Scale

1126
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,160
So if this is the case, it will always be double and double

1127
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,260
So if this is the case

1128
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,360
Impossible to keep going up

1129
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,560
we are looking for

1130
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,560
in the fine element

1131
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,760
This thing is almost at a bottleneck

1132
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,760
that's there

1133
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,860
in such a development

1134
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,760
This is actually a history of the twentieth century

1135
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,360
is a very very very special situation

1136
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,360
because you probably said

1137
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,760
We probably only buy computers

1138
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,160
every year every two years

1139
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,760
things are getting better

1140
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,760
price did not increase

1141
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,960
It's outdated after a year or two

1142
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,560
you can imagine you buy a car

1143
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,560
We are twenty or thirty years from now

1144
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,560
Your car's speed is about the same

1145
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,560
you never said

1146
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,760
There is room for improvement like this

1147
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,760
so

1148
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,260
The result of that

1149
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,260
that is

1150
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,260
price has been

1151
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So the price of each Processor

1152
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Per transistor cycle

1153
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
you do the same buy the same

1154
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
computer for the same money

1155
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
faster and faster

1156
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
more and more

1157
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
In 20, 30, 30, 40 years

1158
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
this is big

1159
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
for the progress of our species

1160
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
The development of many things is very, very

1161
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
the impact is very far-reaching

1162
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Although with your mobile phone

1163
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Features in smartphones

1164
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
is very advanced

1165
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
about twenty or thirty years ago

1166
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
you need a big computer

1167
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
one does the same thing

1168
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
So say in

1169
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
such a progress

1170
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
everyone will find out

1171
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
this can't go on

1172
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So at that time everyone wanted to say

1173
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
is having a...

1174
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
This just that Law

1175
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
maybe...

1176
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
one day will stop

1177
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
why

1178
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
We do this when the current motor body is loose

1179
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
there will be many...

1180
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
a lot of problems happen

1181
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Plus when you have so much stuff in there

1182
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
When a lot of electrons are flowing around inside

1183
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
you generate a lot of heat

1184
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
lots of resistors

1185
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Then we'll have some

1186
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
the problems in these

1187
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
then it's all over that

1188
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
The thickness of the Jetplasma

1189
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Then we can't put something

1190
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
keep shrinking

1191
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
You also shrink to the end to get to the original

1192
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
So in an industry like this

1193
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Under such a big and such a big industry

1194
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
everyone is thinking

1195
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
what to do next

1196
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
so in

1197
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
So at this time everyone is

1198
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I want to ask what is an alternative

1199
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
tie this element

1200
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
because we almost

1201
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
entire electronics industry

1202
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
It's just one industry in one department

1203
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
a lot of material

1204
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
ever been considered

1205
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
like this is a

1206
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
A semiconductor of the so-called III-V group

1207
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
There are these different

1208
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,620
these elements

1209
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,120
that they have some good properties

1210
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,000
There is something called this Mobility

1211
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,160
Mobility basically means

1212
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,920
when you test the voltage

1213
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,200
how fast can your electron go

1214
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,600
you can imagine

1215
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,120
or its

1216
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,160
its frequency

1217
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,880
that is to say it can make

1218
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,680
Those are the frequencies of the components

1219
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,600
That's what it uses

1220
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,920
Might have some better effects

1221
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,000
but these things are very rail

1222
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,600
Then there are some problems

1223
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,160
The middle insulator is hard to find

1224
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,800
at the same time

1225
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,240
also thought of some

1226
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,040
other bigger

1227
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,840
These semiconductors of BangGap

1228
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,880
those like

1229
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,520
Even the Diamond itself

1230
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,640
has also been considered

1231
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,760
Of course they have their benefits

1232
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,680
we have some

1233
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,200
like ibm

1234
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,080
that was 몇 years ago

1235
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,240
made a big investment

1236
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,040
Then decided to say that there is no way to get a good product

1237
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,300
There's a downside to all these things

1238
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,840
That is not very cheap

1239
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,300
then on production

1240
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,740
If you want to grow a good body

1241
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,540
it's not easy

1242
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:20,100
So in the entire electronics industry

1243
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,100
Been trying to say we're looking for a new material

1244
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,100
new material

1245
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,540
So when this graphite west thing came out

1246
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:31,540
Everyone became very talkative

1247
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,940
think it's a big thing

1248
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,180
then why

1249
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:39,680
This incident started when we explored the museum in Nano

1250
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,640
everyone can see

1251
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,040
it has a nice nature

1252
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,080
This nice property means that

1253
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,280
its

1254
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,780
For example, you take a copper wire or something

1255
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,540
you pass the current

1256
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,940
You're going to measure its resistance later

1257
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,780
that's usually the longer words

1258
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:56,640
The resistance will be larger

1259
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,380
Because electrons have to travel such a long route

1260
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,680
As for nanoprobes or other similar structures

1261
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,640
this is an experiment

1262
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:12,060
That is to say, these conduction numbers and lengths

1263
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,520
that's almost irrelevant

1264
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:18,320
is a flat one line here

1265
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,160
means that I increase its length

1266
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,680
I don't increase its resistance

1267
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,560
Then this is a very, very good image

1268
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,360
That is to say, its resistance is very small

1269
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,840
it doesn't lose much heat here

1270
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:35,400
The reason for this is in its electronic structure

1271
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,000
In its SP2 arrangement

1272
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,880
Then there is a more advanced theory

1273
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,960
to explain it in very physical terms

1274
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,440
actually go figure it out

1275
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,800
I will not go through those for now

1276
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,720
Because it has something to do with some very interesting physical phenomena

1277
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,760
You can see it in this article where it says

1278
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,480
It is notation and neutrino like particle

1279
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,400
It's those high energy ones

1280
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,240
Some Particles in Ratvistic

1281
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,340
so it's in this

1282
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,680
some of it

1283
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:12,040
When the mathematical structure and that describe some properties

1284
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,080
It has something to do with these

1285
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,840
So for a physicist

1286
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,540
it's an interesting material

1287
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:21,840
Then there are some deep physics in it

1288
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,280
how to calculate it how to understand its nature

1289
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,000
What about practically?

1290
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,200
It is a good electronic material

1291
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,400
Then this time was when I was exploring the museum in Nano

1292
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,900
has been discovered

1293
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,000
That's just to say that nanometer exploration is not easy to master

1294
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,900
not working well

1295
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:43,140
So when the two-dimensional space

1296
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,700
The one with those British scientists in 2004

1297
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,000
lab found

1298
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,300
you can make this piece of stuff

1299
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:53,700
Like that video on YouTube I just had

1300
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,300
It is convenient for everyone to make it

1301
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,600
Then everyone thinks

1302
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,100
this is a very very good trick

1303
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,880
here in this one

1304
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,240
I guess it's probably the only place

1305
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,880
you can see an equation stone

1306
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,680
So this is our structure

1307
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,040
So this thing was actually in the 1940s

1308
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,880
Everyone thought of it in the 1950s

1309
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,040
a theorist thinks

1310
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,680
If there is a thing like this

1311
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,440
what kind of nature will it have

1312
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,280
At that time, I already counted some

1313
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,280
the nature of this

1314
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,840
this is a picture

1315
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,440
I draw here and this side is energy

1316
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,000
Here it actually says something like

1317
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,560
momentum is momentum

1318
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,240
electronic one

1319
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,280
Usually in any solid structure

1320
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,480
or inside the structure

1321
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,600
We usually look at the so-called energy levels like this

1322
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,480
The special place is in this part

1323
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,560
Because this part of its energy and its momentum

1324
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:55,840
There is a direct contrast between

1325
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,400
because we are in different

1326
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,160
inside the usual electronics

1327
00:53:59,320 --> 00:53:59,840
its

1328
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,360
Its engineering equation should look like this

1329
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,880
In ordinary gene numbers, ordinary semiconductors

1330
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,560
This is actually a

1331
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,400
Momentum P-Square

1332
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,860
stored energy multiplied by 2

1333
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,200
I think you think high school physics

1334
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,380
is the momentum squared

1335
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:18,640
Stored by mass multiplied by 2

1336
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,000
will get your momentum

1337
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,280
so it's basically the same thing

1338
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,680
But if this is the case

1339
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,840
such a description

1340
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,680
is a completely different one

1341
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,800
a structure of electrons

1342
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,320
in such a nature

1343
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,720
so

1344
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,080
everyone has one

1345
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,120
understanding is

1346
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,720
it is a very special substance

1347
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,520
then we are in

1348
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,120
You've probably heard one

1349
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,160
a term like this

1350
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,000
That is to say, it looks like this

1351
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,200
A relationship of linear

1352
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,360
will get

1353
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,800
here will get some

1354
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,520
very different electronic structure

1355
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,240
so i think

1356
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,440
That's probably all I'm talking about here.

1357
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,480
won't go down that

1358
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,200
If you are interested

1359
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
If you are interested, we can discuss it again

1360
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,440
its main benefit

1361
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,640
It is the so-called Mobility that I just mentioned

1362
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,840
That is to say, after you add a voltage

1363
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,440
How can electrons move freely?

1364
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,600
Still bumping into some big resistors

1365
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,040
That is for Graphene and Smootc

1366
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,500
We usually use a Mobility like this

1367
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,740
something like this to represent

1368
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,040
it is quite large

1369
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,040
Usually Silicone is

1370
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,240
Like Graphene

1371
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,080
This is probably more than

1372
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,640
Many, more than 100 times

1373
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,640
So this is a very good property

1374
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,040
This means that

1375
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,880
When our electrons flow here

1376
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,640
it's been a long time

1377
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,840
About a few microns

1378
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,200
The micron is about 10 of -6 when it is released

1379
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,600
there will be a collision

1380
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,400
Its Linfree Path is how long it is

1381
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,680
How long does it take to collide

1382
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,480
this is very long

1383
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,040
So this is very important for making electronic components

1384
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,400
very very good thing

1385
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,600
so this matter

1386
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,600
Everyone has already measured such a number

1387
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,960
Then I think it's a

1388
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,520
A goal worth pursuing

1389
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,000
Scientists all over the world are trying to find a way to say

1390
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,440
How do I grow the best form out

1391
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,600
because we just saw that

1392
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,440
you can be very simple

1393
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,720
use duct tape to get something out

1394
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,080
But the pollution inside

1395
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,160
It is not mass-manufacturable

1396
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,840
The goal now is to say

1397
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,320
how to make a like

1398
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,040
It is very big in the silicon industry

1399
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,280
size

1400
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,080
capable of mass production

1401
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,680
so everyone

1402
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,440
many many laboratories

1403
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,600
now all are chasing

1404
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,280
This is a

1405
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,120
a big one

1406
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,240
A major goal to be recognized by all

1407
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,640
Now this is about last year

1408
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,280
in 2010

1409
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,640
They can grow on metal surfaces

1410
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,880
can grow to a

1411
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,240
probably at

1412
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,880
you want this 0.2

1413
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,920
millimeter

1414
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,840
this is so

1415
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,120
so it grows to a fairly large

1416
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,200
A Grapin sheet

1417
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,400
There are hundreds of micron in size

1418
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,280
So I'm still searching

1419
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,160
so maybe i think in the past

1420
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,360
next few years maybe

1421
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,320
Sometimes I hear in the news that

1422
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,720
so-and-so laboratory

1423
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,400
did something

1424
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,880
that is likely to be with

1425
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,080
how do they make

1426
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,240
how to produce

1427
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,920
think of a way to

1428
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,920
find a good sample

1429
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,360
There is a way to mass-produce

1430
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,520
There are many, many ways

1431
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,880
One of them is of course

1432
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,640
Of course it doesn't mean to explain it.

1433
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,720
they can grow on a

1434
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,640
related to semiconductor

1435
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,040
像Silicon Carbide

1436
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,200
How do you translate it in Chinese?

1437
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,080
put on it

1438
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,920
then heat

1439
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,640
Then the sucker runs away

1440
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,080
the remaining carbon atom

1441
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,880
so it can grow to be different

1442
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,840
On the Grapin of the different layers

1443
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,280
that in such a long way

1444
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,000
has now started

1445
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
got some results

1446
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,540
So this just says

1447
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,000
results in last year

1448
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07,000
Might be able to make some transistors out

1449
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,160
It's the size of 34mm

1450
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,160
probably grown to

1451
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,800
a lot of that

1452
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,720
ten thousand of that

1453
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,440
Transistors are now starting to do this

1454
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,160
such a point

1455
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,640
So of course there is still a long way to go

1456
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,440
But we slowly start

1457
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,720
it will be like this

1458
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,840
probably in the near future

1459
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,800
everyone can see say

1460
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,080
some results came out

1461
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:33,640
certainly

1462
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,160
people will ask

1463
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,920
Our current computer is so good

1464
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,600
so convenient

1465
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,120
i do something every day

1466
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,760
Receive some emails directly

1467
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,800
take a look online

1468
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:46,560
I don't need that big function

1469
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,040
OK

1470
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,160
so nothing wrong

1471
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,320
This I think probably this thing is

1472
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,360
some things you will need later

1473
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,160
compare special features

1474
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,040
that special thing

1475
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,200
this is still

1476
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,760
That is to say, common things still exist

1477
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,720
then this may be another development

1478
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,800
That is to say, the development of computers with high performance and special functions

1479
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:16,800
It may be necessary to find some new materials to do this

1480
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,600
so we'll see

1481
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,760
maybe in the next few years

1482
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:26,000
I know several big companies like IDM or

1483
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,400
What about Texas Instruments?

1484
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,400
Some of us are heavily invested

1485
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,400
Hope to be able to not lag behind in this field

1486
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,400
But there's still a lot of it

1487
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,400
scientific problems to be solved

1488
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,400
Now I want to summarize

1489
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,400
The graphite west area we just talked about

1490
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,400
look at the atom

1491
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,400
It's the thinnest material we know of

1492
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,400
because it's only one atom thick

1493
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,400
then what about it

1494
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,800
Has great Electron Mobility

1495
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,080
Its battery movement is pretty good

1496
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,040
At least 100 times better than Silicone

1497
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:13,600
Now continue to improve the material may be even better

1498
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,720
And it's a very, very special material

1499
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,120
because it has other features

1500
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,600
This Silicone is not available

1501
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:28,440
For example, its electrical conductivity is also very good.

1502
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,040
so what happened to you hot

1503
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,560
Let it go and you'll spread the word

1504
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,640
this is a strange thing

1505
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,680
It's very nice to have pine silver already metalized to heat

1506
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,120
It puts silver 10 times better than silver

1507
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,400
so heat doesn't build up

1508
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,040
will spread

1509
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,040
Then it is also a strong

1510
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,960
very strong material

1511
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,400
Because their carbon atoms follow the carbon atoms

1512
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,280
Chemicals are strong

1513
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,680
So it's also hard to tear it apart

1514
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,000
Usually we know that very strong materials

1515
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
For example, steel

1516
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,000
He will be two hundred times stronger than him

1517
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
That is, if we pull it up

1518
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
just put so much pressure

1519
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
he still won't break

1520
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
so he is a

1521
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
On the other hand, it is also a strange

1522
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
have very special properties

1523
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Then this is physically and engineering

1524
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Compared with such considerations

1525
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
But in chemistry

1526
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
We also found some very strange

1527
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
very special news

1528
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Because it's a piece of this thing

1529
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
So we can put a lot of different

1530
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
chemical molecule on top

1531
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
then change its properties

1532
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
so many many chemists

1533
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
or the chemistry industry are doing different research

1534
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
wish to change its nature

1535
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
take say put some different molecules

1536
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
put it on top

1537
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Adsorbed on it

1538
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
then change its properties

1539
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
at the same time on the optical

1540
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
This is the one I want to pursue now

1541
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
It also has some optical properties

1542
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
we can use

1543
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Usually in this so-called

1544
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,120
The one that SpinTronics uses that electron

1545
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,280
Spin word spin above it has some

1546
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,840
Those functions of magnetic

1547
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,760
It is also very likely that there are some

1548
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,000
The application space is inside

1549
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,560
So this is why there are so many papers

1550
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,000
Because everyone will find different places in it

1551
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,240
do things differently

1552
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,680
That many people now think of its application

1553
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,440
that in this thing is just in

1554
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,800
This is from that YTPD

1555
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,760
because everyone this place

1556
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,200
Everyone can put different things on it

1557
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,840
that can be found saying

1558
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,040
Let's say you cut it into a

1559
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,400
ribbon thing

1560
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,320
In addition there is another

1561
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,640
Give it another direction

1562
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,360
Confirmation is limited to

1563
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,280
you will find that say

1564
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,600
Hey, you can change some electronic structures

1565
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,400
So this is called Natal Rehab

1566
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,400
So many laboratories are doing this kind of work now

1567
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,040
Then it can do a

1568
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,040
molecular gas detector

1569
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
You put different molecules on top

1570
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,680
you find it conductive

1571
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,000
or those inductions

1572
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,600
you can measure it

1573
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,880
Then of course we've seen

1574
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:10,800
Groger's Transistor

1575
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,280
can already be made

1576
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,280
Integrate Circuit

1577
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,200
Integrated circuits start slowly

1578
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,680
You can put a lot of transistors on it

1579
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:21,400
Then we saw that someone wanted to use it to do

1580
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,680
The function of that solar cell

1581
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,840
Because it's something in this area

1582
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,480
can make good electrodes

1583
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,480
Then some Bio-Device

1584
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,960
Then found out that bacteria don't like

1585
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,480
This M-Pack Bacteria Stuff

1586
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,080
bacteria don't like this stuff

1587
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:38,280
So you can consider saying

1588
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,280
This can be done for applications in Bio-

1589
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,280
So after this thing comes out

1590
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,680
All scientists develop independently

1591
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,480
everyone's imagination

1592
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,080
Then hopefully it will find that say

1593
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:54,280
how things would be different

1594
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,280
can happen

1595
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,280
can create the one that will find various applications

1596
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,500
right

1597
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,340
good

1598
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,840
Come again, I want to go back to the end

1599
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,500
That is to say our original one of course

1600
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:10,840
Morse that Roll

1601
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
let's go back to that

1602
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:15,500
I might go back to that picture just now

1603
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,860
That is to say, this thing

1604
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,700
keep going up

1605
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,900
our e-sports

1606
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:25,040
On that CPU more and more

1607
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,340
computers are getting faster

1608
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,540
that's possible

1609
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:28,500
what about this line

1610
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:29,500
This is Silicon's line

1611
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,800
Maybe it's going up all the way to the end and it will definitely hit HIT

1612
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,660
must reach this limit

1613
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,840
What about before reaching this limit?

1614
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,160
we can imagine

1615
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:41,660
Maybe change a thread or use another material

1616
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,660
that could be the one

1617
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,660
The whole limit might be different

1618
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:50,040
that's what we want to do right now

1619
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:54,040
Then Guo Renmu put this

1620
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,660
when making this prediction

1621
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,840
He also imagined that when

1622
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,180
such a degree

1623
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,760
This is a so-called Explonational Growth

1624
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,840
But it just can't be Forever

1625
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:11,440
So he finally proposed in 1965 that year after

1626
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,240
in his 50 years

1627
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,240
I put him in the last one

1628
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:25,240
on his 50th anniversary

1629
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:30,240
he mentioned

1630
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,240
No explanation is forever

1631
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,240
it's impossible to go all the way up

1632
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,240
but

1633
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,240
Ok, Delay forever

1634
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,240
Just change that forever

1635
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:43,240
So everyone hopes to find new materials

1636
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,240
be able to develop another way

1637
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,240
I think a lot this time

1638
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,240
Scientists in the world are now a goal to strive for

1639
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:55,240
Like I'm coming to an end today

1640
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,240
Then

1641
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,600
I'll see if you have any questions

1642
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,400
Thank you Director Zhou for your wonderful speech

1643
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,800
we have a lot of time

1644
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,800
is there anyone here who can

1645
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,700
Ask Director Zhou

1646
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,300
you just mentioned that

1647
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:22,900
Graphite sita is ten times better than winning

1648
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:26,800
Then I will ask Director Zhou

1649
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:33,600
Is it possible that Moxi West can expect to win at all

1650
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,400
The second question is

1651
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,400
The cost of graphite west and the cost of winning

1652
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,600
How much is the difference? Thank you

1653
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,900
OK he's ten times better than winning

1654
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,500
That's his thermal conductivity

1655
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:51,500
To win has his function

1656
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:55,200
Winning him is a very expensive thing

1657
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,000
why is it expensive

1658
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:59,100
because he's almost he's a precious metal

1659
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,200
he is not easy

1660
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,600
Not easy to oxidize, right?

1661
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,440
like gold

1662
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,440
Pure gold is also not easy to oxidize

1663
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,320
Feature Stick Metal

1664
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,820
it has its special form

1665
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:10,320
Although the meaning of replacing the battalion is to say

1666
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,820
you may be in some

1667
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,020
Let's say I need to be very thermally conductive

1668
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:17,820
Of course we have some contacts

1669
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:20,320
Where do you go in two years?

1670
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:24,260
Metal Has Its Benefits

1671
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:25,860
it can melt with sweat

1672
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,260
Then glue it on like that

1673
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:30,260
What is actually a two-dimensional thing

1674
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:33,260
So it's only partially possible

1675
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:34,660
no way completely

1676
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,560
cannot completely replace

1677
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,460
because every material has

1678
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:39,960
The benefits of each material

1679
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,960
Give plastic the benefits of plastic

1680
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:44,460
Glass has the benefits of porcelain

1681
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,760
So we use it for something

1682
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,760
is the best place to use it

1683
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,260
That high thermal conductivity

1684
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:52,560
have a comparative advantage

1685
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,460
For example, many of us

1686
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:55,460
you are in the computer

1687
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:56,660
Normally you would think this place

1688
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:59,160
The CPU is very hot

1689
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,160
next to

1690
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,760
Add a fan to send the heat out

1691
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,600
sometimes you are opening to see

1692
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,000
one place it has a copper shelf

1693
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,640
over there for heat dissipation

1694
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,440
So if you use something like graphite

1695
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,600
It's no problem to dissipate heat.

1696
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,040
so it's a benefit

1697
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,560
so it dissipates heat quickly

1698
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,160
yes it will spread the heat

1699
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,680
it will spread

1700
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,320
when it works by itself

1701
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,240
doesn't generate a lot of heat either

1702
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,240
because it's that

1703
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,640
great mobility

1704
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,160
so it doesn't say

1705
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,160
The heat is because we have resistance

1706
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,920
Resistance is where electrons pass through

1707
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,120
I'm about to collide with someone

1708
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,000
hit it hit it hit it

1709
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,040
generate a lot of heat

1710
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,480
It has to go a long way before colliding

1711
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,480
So yes it's good here

1712
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,240
Yes, there may be some possibilities in the future

1713
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:52,240
Of course if we say good

1714
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,800
thermal conductivity

1715
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,800
then design these

1716
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,480
These heavy heads these electronic components

1717
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,000
about to be redesigned

1718
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,080
Redesign him to take full advantage of his benefits

1719
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,140
Thanks

1720
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,940
What about the second question?

1721
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:08,960
his

1722
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:10,760
his cost

1723
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:12,040
cost

1724
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,820
Cost is hard to say now

1725
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:14,840
Because now

1726
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,400
us

1727
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:19,980
you imagine this

1728
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:22,280
Silicone industry this industry

1729
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:23,300
from

1730
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,340
take off in the 60s

1731
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:26,620
until now

1732
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,700
40 years 40 years 50 years this

1733
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,540
decades down

1734
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,340
everything is already

1735
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,120
completely

1736
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:36,660
developed

1737
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:37,940
so

1738
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,500
For Smoji his

1739
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,040
how to make the first

1740
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:43,060
Now

1741
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:47,920
Is it still in a stage of scientific research

1742
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:51,000
Because we still want to find the best way

1743
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:54,580
The cheapest way to manufacture in large quantities

1744
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,620
and then made his

1745
01:09:56,620 --> 01:10:00,220
the extent of his limit

1746
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,600
not too many impurities

1747
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,240
So this is what we just mentioned

1748
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:07,200
Scientists almost all over the world think that

1749
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,880
It's a very, very clear goal

1750
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,000
you know who can find a best way

1751
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,400
He may be the next number

1752
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,600
so he knows

1753
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,240
This is a very important topic

1754
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,240
Then if it can be solved

1755
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:26,400
The impact on the future is very heavy

1756
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,560
So in the end how expensive he will be

1757
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,520
or how

1758
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,120
now we have no idea

1759
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,160
because how is this

1760
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,520
Everyone is still playing

1761
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,560
say who can find the best way

1762
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,800
So how much will it cost him?

1763
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,600
we don't know now

1764
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,640
silver is expensive

1765
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,560
we know silver is expensive

1766
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,600
so

1767
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,320
So it's hard to predict what the future holds

1768
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,880
For example, you go back to 20 years ago

1769
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,920
then someone tells you

1770
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,880
you can hold a phone in your hand

1771
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,600
you can hold a phone in your hand

1772
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,640
20 years ago there were mobile phones which were very big

1773
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,000
still on the car

1774
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,160
because of the contact

1775
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,200
So now like this little phone

1776
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,560
told you 20 years ago

1777
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:10,920
I have a call after you sign

1778
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:11,960
You can also access the Internet

1779
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,720
At that time, I didn't know what the internet was

1780
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:17,920
So what will happen next?

1781
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,880
This is difficult for us to predict

1782
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:26,000
That's just to say that each of these research breakthroughs

1783
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,840
will give us some new hope

1784
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,400
in cash

1785
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,440
The gap between graphite and rock

1786
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,400
Now look at what kind of graphene

1787
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,640
you can make it yourself from the account

1788
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,240
or are you going to buy

1789
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,440
someone can grow

1790
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,240
There aren't many that are really on sale right now.

1791
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,480
because everyone is developing

1792
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,200
Today I said I can sell you a little today

1793
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,360
There is a new method coming out tomorrow

1794
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,600
That is to say, there are constantly new

1795
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,360
Every month, you will see new papers coming out

1796
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,240
i want to do this

1797
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,340
It will take a while before we can decide who will eat it

1798
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:06,780
or what is the best way

1799
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:08,620
Thanks

1800
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:09,420
Thanks

1801
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:13,420
Watch the news slowly, maybe in the next few years, you will see some in the news

1802
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:15,720
Said that agricultural scientists discovered something

1803
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,380
Let what is related to the real ink system

1804
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:20,060
There should be a lot of news about this

1805
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:21,820
Thank you so much

1806
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:23,740
Who

1807
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:28,100
Ask Director Zhuo

1808
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,100
It is because of the Lanometer part

1809
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,100
In our natural world

1810
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,700
did it happen naturally

1811
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,040
I mean say for example

1812
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,200
Galaxy T

1813
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:42,400
Then we will develop to a certain point in the future

1814
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:43,980
our natural world

1815
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:47,380
Because the industry has used a lot of Lanometer

1816
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:52,180
There is no way for nature to consume these things that come out

1817
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:54,880
Then if we prevent these phenomena

1818
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,580
now a subject

1819
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:00,080
means sell your stuff

1820
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,460
Is it harmful to the human body

1821
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,860
because you know small things can go through

1822
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:08,660
So while some people do some research

1823
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:11,340
that is to say, what harm will

1824
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:16,380
That thing is not very clear now

1825
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:19,820
because something like

1826
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:22,400
Something like that Carbon-6-6-6

1827
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,300
not very reactive

1828
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,620
It is not easy to reflect with many things

1829
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:32,020
So the comparison probably won't do much harm

1830
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:35,860
you are right

1831
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:38,860
Naturally, there are some like that nano-explorer

1832
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:40,260
found out later

1833
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:41,980
when it heats like this

1834
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:43,900
As far as everyone finds out, those who say black

1835
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:44,980
Inside those things

1836
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:46,620
Maybe it was before

1837
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:48,460
It's just that people didn't find it

1838
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:53,060
But more and more man-made examples of these nanometers

1839
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:57,460
Of course, you have to be more careful what kind of elements you look at.

1840
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:00,060
At least for now there will be

1841
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Haven't found a big big one that hurts

1842
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,960
But this is in the engineering school

1843
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,640
about environmental engineering

1844
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,640
This is a very important subject

1845
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,920
That is to say, considering the problem of environmental pollution

1846
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,120
or harm to the human body

1847
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,640
This is something everyone is considering now

1848
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,400
a subject among some

1849
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,880
that said in nature

1850
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,800
like i said far away

1851
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:32,520
There is actually that desire in my luck

1852
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,160
it's surprising

1853
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,840
Maybe we've had it on Earth before

1854
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,800
It's just that everyone didn't try to find it out.

1855
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,160
so

1856
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,760
I think a very short answer

1857
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,760
Probably what I just said

1858
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,920
This is a subject currently under study

1859
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,160
It is also an important subject

1860
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,640
What kind of harm will it do to humans?

1861
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,800
will it hurt

1862
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,240
it's not clear yet

1863
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:08,240
maybe for some elements

1864
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,800
It is because some elements are more poisonous

1865
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,440
If it becomes endurance

1866
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:17,040
when it penetrates the skin or something

1867
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,880
That may cause more damage

1868
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,640
For charcoal

1869
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:26,240
It compares if it doesn't work as well as others

1870
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:29,080
then it might not be that big

1871
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:33,680
But this time Liu Dai said that scholars and experts should study it carefully.

1872
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,400
thank you for a very good speech

1873
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,960
Two questions for Chief Zhou

1874
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:47,280
the first one is very

1875
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:52,600
A while ago HITC Superconductor was a very, very popular topic

1876
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,280
But then there are several technical problems

1877
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,480
Of course, the most important thing is that there is no way to mention three things and four temperature

1878
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,600
if say

1879
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,340
If one day Superconductor ITC can be raised to room temperature

1880
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:09,660
Which one do you think is more effective than this one?

1881
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,460
or better

1882
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:12,900
This is the first question

1883
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:14,540
The second question I want to ask is

1884
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:17,940
Most of his people so far speak Electronics

1885
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:20,100
Talk about the Golden one just now

1886
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:24,860
If the Golden Model seems to be 2Dimension

1887
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:27,900
Have you thought about 3Dimension

1888
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:30,940
Use Optical and Transparent

1889
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:32,860
In fact, he only needs to add a Dimension

1890
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:35,260
He can increase quickly

1891
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:37,540
thousands of times millions of times

1892
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:41,980
Is this another way to get around that limitation

1893
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:42,860
Thanks

1894
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:43,300
OK

1895
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:44,980
very good question

1896
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,100
first question

1897
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:49,740
Hitc superconducting high temperature superconducting

1898
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:56,300
The benefits he wants to solve or can get

1899
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:57,540
not like this

1900
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:00,140
His main thing is that he just wants to fight

1901
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,300
will not say

1902
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:04,460
But it is not a

1903
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,620
But semiconductors are not a

1904
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,460
make that electronic component

1905
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:09,460
it can be used

1906
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:11,460
That is to say, some parts can also be used in the middle

1907
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:12,620
make wires what?

1908
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:15,620
But it doesn't have the structure of these semiconductors

1909
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:17,060
have these good qualities

1910
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:19,180
This is what we need to make a

1911
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:23,660
Materials used to make a computer like this

1912
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:26,620
That high temperature superconductor is now

1913
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:29,460
That is to say, there are some technical problems

1914
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:30,920
after it reaches a certain stage

1915
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,420
just stop there

1916
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:35,720
the temperature won't go up

1917
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:38,920
Of course this means

1918
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,420
one suddenly has a breakthrough

1919
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:42,460
then stop there

1920
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:43,660
many many years

1921
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:46,620
Everyone can't find a way to break it

1922
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:49,920
This will say to wait for the next wave

1923
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,660
Now a lot of people are finding new material

1924
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:54,820
The temperature is not that high

1925
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:59,160
But the more we learn about this substance

1926
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
We know better which direction to look for

1927
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,360
So there is no basis for this

1928
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:09,160
The two problems solved are different

1929
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,160
The two solutions are not the same

1930
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,160
that physically speaking

1931
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,160
they are very

1932
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,160
Both are a very challenging

1933
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,660
one of those subjects

1934
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:22,160
That is, if someone can figure it out

1935
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,160
This is

1936
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:26,160
That is to say, a very big contribution

1937
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,160
That

1938
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,920
Just the second question

1939
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,920
so far

1940
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,920
to this 2 reps

1941
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,920
2 reps

1942
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,920
right

1943
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,920
exist

1944
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,920
before this

1945
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,920
while everyone is discussing that

1946
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,920
When Morse Law

1947
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,920
there is a direction

1948
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:50,920
The transistor that walks in 3D

1949
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,920
was that time

1950
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,920
And there are still some people

1951
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,920
Continue to pursue making it 3D

1952
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,920
make it flat

1953
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,920
inside too

1954
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,280
encountered some difficulties

1955
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,840
That is according to the material

1956
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,880
You just mentioned another

1957
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:09,220
That is to say, from the optical way

1958
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:10,500
to interact with him

1959
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:14,080
That's the direction everyone's been thinking about for many years.

1960
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,120
Because in the silicon base

1961
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,920
What we call optical electronics

1962
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,460
we hope to have some

1963
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,760
Silicon can follow

1964
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,800
Those laser beams or some optical ones

1965
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:24,840
some coupling

1966
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,880
which can then be put together

1967
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,960
Not just conductive electronics come out

1968
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:32,260
Then follow this outside optical

1969
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:34,820
The probes are somewhat associated

1970
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:36,860
so that was a very

1971
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,920
That is to say, a big subject

1972
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:40,460
many people are chasing

1973
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:43,020
It's just that at that time

1974
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,800
silicon with

1975
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,640
Because it is it does not absorb light very well

1976
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:52,240
Because it is the so-called indirect gap

1977
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,540
Its direct gap is relatively large

1978
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,840
its absorbing light

1979
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,120
this or that

1980
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,680
It means about three or four ED

1981
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,240
will have a lot of absorption

1982
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:06,440
So that's a really big specific

1983
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,480
That is how to follow

1984
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,200
The Silicone Base Electronics

1985
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,480
with some of these Optical

1986
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,080
can be combined

1987
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,600
This is many, many, many years of hard work

1988
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,000
not yet fully achieved

1989
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,280
So for Silicone

1990
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,200
This aspect is relatively weak

1991
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,280
Of course, if you change to other materials

1992
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,840
maybe there is another possibility

1993
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,600
This can have another

1994
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,680
Follow Optics and Electronics

1995
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:38,200
can have a better combination

1996
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:43,760
So this is also in these semiconductor industries

1997
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,120
Some problems that everyone has been trying to solve

1998
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,720
It is also the direction of development

1999
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,040
It's just that there are no good results yet.

2000
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:56,520
total maintenance

2001
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:59,080
this is

2002
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,000
i want to talk

2003
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,560
has great usage

2004
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,040
i think it's ok

2005
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,100
i think we can

2006
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,420
think about it

2007
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:10,700
we need to talk to us

2008
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,440
of this object

2009
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,700
Need to consult with us

2010
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:16,280
Congratulations

2011
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,620
Congratulations

2012
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,400
That is to say before Bucky Bull was

2013
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,200
When carbon 60 came out

2014
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,200
In fact, he had many different applications at the beginning.

2015
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,600
But it doesn't seem to have seen anything yet

2016
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,400
practical application in life

2017
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,800
I don't know if he was later

2018
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,700
where did one meet him

2019
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:18,000
the solution of development

2020
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,500
That's compared to Graphite Creek now

2021
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:23,600
Is there any place for reference?

2022
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:24,400
Thanks

2023
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:29,100
OK, the original carbon 60 because it is one by one

2024
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:32,200
So if you want to use

2025
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,100
I want you to find a way to get to the area

2026
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:39,500
be able to use it to do something

2027
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,600
and put it together or do

2028
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,000
OK Carbon 60 over there

2029
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,200
In fact, it will be discharged into a solid carbon 60

2030
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,800
Each unit is carbon 60

2031
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:53,400
Then there are some nice properties in that

2032
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,300
you can talk to another one

2033
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:57,500
Echoline Metals to put in

2034
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,600
make some new some

2035
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,540
image of object

2036
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:04,040
But the real use

2037
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,400
That is to say, one by one

2038
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:06,500
how are you going

2039
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,840
how do you grab one to do something

2040
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,700
put it back

2041
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:11,640
This thing is more difficult

2042
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,840
That graphite west side

2043
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,640
Everyone will feel a little hopeful

2044
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,140
wish it was such a large piece of long

2045
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:21,140
grow out of the bottom

2046
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,900
Then a large piece of it is produced in large quantities

2047
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:25,960
Then use some more from above

2048
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:27,140
we have those now

2049
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:30,340
Lysograph's method to cut

2050
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,640
or make those three mouthfuls

2051
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,040
it's easier this way

2052
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:36,140
easier to make things

2053
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:37,200
the shape you want

2054
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,960
or whatever you want

2055
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:41,840
because of the carbon talc stuff

2056
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,100
You said you were going to grab one

2057
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:45,140
how do you catch

2058
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,000
such a small thing

2059
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:50,200
there's no way you can grab it with anything

2060
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:51,600
or to adsorb

2061
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:52,100
or you put it

2062
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:54,100
At best, stick it to the surface

2063
01:22:54,100 --> 01:23:00,060
to make some control changes

2064
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,840
Like that, so the above is a bit higher in terms of difficulty.

2065
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:06,240
So if you really go

2066
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:10,000
Is there really any good application for Greedy Stone?

2067
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,940
that might be in science

2068
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:15,500
But it doesn't seem to say that it is made into a product

2069
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,540
It is a product of Tanyoushi.

2070
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:18,540
i don't know if

2071
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:23,140
I'm not entirely aware of recent developments

2072
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:24,940
So I can't talk about this place

2073
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:25,740
That's it

2074
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:29,140
At that time, Moxi was mainly because he combined the previous

2075
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:31,980
everyone on this surface

2076
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:35,280
The semiconductor industry is doing this on the surface

2077
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:36,780
how to grow film

2078
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:40,140
How to do these layer by layer

2079
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,940
There is a lot of experience in this area

2080
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,880
So his two-dimensional thing

2081
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,380
He can be more easily controlled

2082
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:49,840
easy to set it up

2083
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,380
then become something

2084
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:52,980
Layer Shelf or Shera

2085
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:55,640
Or design some other structure

2086
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,340
it's easier stuff

2087
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:59,380
Now the most important thing is to say

2088
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,580
how can you grow well

2089
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,540
and then be able to control it

2090
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,080
can then be mass-produced

2091
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:10,880
then also very cheap

2092
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,540
It's not that there are only a few places where it can grow

2093
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,040
OK and then when it's over

2094
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,880
you can understand its nature

2095
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,780
Then redesign what kind of circuit you want

2096
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:21,540
OK, the design

2097
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:23,580
Maybe it's not the same as before

2098
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:25,380
Because of its electronic nature

2099
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:27,380
The electronic structure is different

2100
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:29,380
ok so then what to do

2101
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:31,420
When it is possible to make a transistor

2102
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:34,120
you put those oxides on it

2103
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,220
or how are you going to do your

2104
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:37,940
get your electricity

2105
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:39,980
Other different types of transistors

2106
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:42,680
So it still needs some

2107
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,380
development over time

2108
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:50,540
So the Norval value of this physics means

2109
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:52,340
We seem to have a

2110
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,140
There is a direction like this

2111
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:56,780
that can really make something

2112
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:58,380
still take a while

2113
01:24:58,540 --> 01:24:59,740
not so fast

2114
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,160
So this thing is

2115
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,160
Just to say that now I seem to see a

2116
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,760
Seems like a pretty promising thing

2117
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,000
At least after trying many, many materials in the past

2118
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,000
we may see there is a hope

2119
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:17,600
Well, these are like a lot of US military

2120
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,160
invested a lot of money

2121
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,660
that's what this development says

2122
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:25,760
It is the kind of High-end is a special function

2123
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:30,220
Then some special electronic components

2124
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:32,480
no you probably wouldn't say

2125
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:33,880
bring this price down so low

2126
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,920
Because we are so computerized now

2127
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:41,220
it's pretty cheap now

2128
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:43,920
also very very very

2129
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,420
Very powerful thing

2130
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:48,380
So the words of the general public

2131
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,060
still the one that lasts so long

2132
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:55,260
Silicon inter-suit will not disappear completely

2133
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:58,640
that just means we have another chance

2134
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,100
go find something better

2135
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Thanks

2136
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:09,000
Two questions. One is that the director just mentioned that

2137
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,680
There are three types of graphite, one is spherical, the other is tube and the other is flat

2138
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:16,440
I would like to ask some of their physical properties in these three states

2139
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:21,440
For example, if I have a bunch, you don't have carbon balls to put together

2140
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:25,000
Then I use light, is it with a bunch of carbon tubes?

2141
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,400
With lighting he has a different sheen or something

2142
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,360
and their properties, for example, in the six bodies

2143
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:34,560
Or is there any difference in physical properties such as conductive poison?

2144
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,960
Then there is the second question

2145
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:43,440
That is, Norbell said that they used tape to layer graphite layer by layer.

2146
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,960
But when we were experimenting

2147
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:48,080
We must control every thickness of him very precisely

2148
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:52,880
How to control the thickness of each layer in the laboratory

2149
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:53,880
Thanks

2150
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,480
OK first question

2151
01:26:55,480 --> 01:27:00,040
He's exploring the pavilion or the ball or the flat graphite

2152
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Its electronic structure is different

2153
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,880
For example, when graphite is a piece, it will reverse electricity

2154
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:08,480
Then if the carbon tube

2155
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,640
Some carbon tubes are semiconductors

2156
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:13,240
Some carbon tubes are metallic

2157
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:15,880
That is, their resistance is relatively small

2158
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:18,000
depending on its direction

2159
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,440
So that aspect can

2160
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,640
Maybe it can be adjusted

2161
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,640
Or you can tune different carbon tubes

2162
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:24,880
jump out that measure up

2163
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,840
may be different

2164
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:30,240
The energy level of the ball

2165
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,840
That is to say, there is a gap

2166
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,680
that is to say itself

2167
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:36,840
that is to say there is a

2168
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,840
energy gap on top

2169
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:40,840
So it's big

2170
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,840
so that

2171
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,840
So its properties are different

2172
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,040
nature is different

2173
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,840
That

2174
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,840
The second question just now is

2175
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:54,240
thickness

2176
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:56,240
How do you say to control it

2177
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:58,240
OK, yes

2178
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,240
You tell me two... actually there is no way to control

2179
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,500
what to do is say

2180
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,340
Later, after many experimenters did this,

2181
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:04,840
I made a lot of them

2182
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:08,340
Then go to the Wangxue Well Weijing to find

2183
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:10,300
I see this seems to be two layers

2184
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:11,440
There seems to be a layer

2185
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,640
you go find students

2186
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,640
you are in a hurry to plan a lot of time

2187
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,840
Just look for it bit by bit for a month

2188
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,840
Look where it says it's a layer

2189
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,840
I'm doing an experiment here

2190
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,540
so it's totally out of control

2191
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:23,540
what did you do

2192
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:24,640
look for what you see

2193
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:26,240
Maybe you can't find this piece

2194
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:28,100
layer by layer that never

2195
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:30,100
If this is expected, you can find it

2196
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,600
If you find it, you can measure it.

2197
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:35,100
So that's pretty much out of control

2198
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:39,800
After that, the more advanced method now

2199
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:42,100
That is to say, if you can grow

2200
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:45,800
You can adjust the situation in the laboratory

2201
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,800
one or two layers

2202
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,800
but only later

2203
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:52,100
So it was just a

2204
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:54,100
a very simple way

2205
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:56,800
there are some samples you can take some measurements

2206
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,800
Then after taking measurements, it was found that

2207
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,800
this seems

2208
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,200
This is of good nature

2209
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:06,700
the whole can repeat

2210
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:09,940
These things don't hit the nail on the head every time

2211
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:11,100
that's mainly for you

2212
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:13,700
Many, many labs can do the same thing

2213
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:16,800
Those measurements that learn a lot can be repeated

2214
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,140
Then everyone will believe

2215
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:20,700
this thing should be right

2216
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:22,700
is such confidence

2217
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:27,240
i want to ask two questions

2218
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,340
It's the first Smosh

2219
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:31,340
if you pull him a little bit

2220
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,040
Then some of his physical properties will change a lot

2221
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:35,340
The second question is

2222
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:38,040
Why is the Tan-60 called Lingwei structure?

2223
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,840
does he have a story

2224
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:42,140
if you pull

2225
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:44,240
His electronic structure will change

2226
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:47,340
That's just saying someone weighed it down

2227
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:50,140
Then his electronic structure

2228
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:54,140
There may be a small one that can GaP will appear

2229
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:56,740
Of course it would take a lot of changes

2230
01:29:56,740 --> 01:30:00,340
Only then will he change his atom-to-atom script

2231
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,400
Is someone trying to say someone took some measurements

2232
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:05,400
Then do some calculations say

2233
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,900
How much force is needed to make the spicy hot

2234
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:09,800
what happens to it after it's hot

2235
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,900
So this is another thing that can be tuned

2236
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:17,900
So if you want to change its nature

2237
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:21,900
This is a mechanical method

2238
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:23,900
can be changed

2239
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:27,400
The second question is why it is called Lingwei

2240
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:29,200
i was from behind

2241
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:32,000
For example, our three-dimensional space

2242
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
If you have a direction take it away

2243
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,300
let it not let it confine you

2244
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:37,900
We become two-dimensional actions

2245
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,800
Like a face, this is two-dimensional

2246
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:42,800
It can move in two directions

2247
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,800
that becomes a line again

2248
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:48,000
If this is the case, you actually need to snuggle because it

2249
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,200
This direction is completely free to move

2250
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:51,800
Then we don't consider the other side

2251
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,500
it won't come out

2252
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:56,000
That said, get it down like this

2253
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,900
What do you call one when you search for me?

2254
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,300
In other words, this is called Lingwei

2255
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:03,200
Because I can't move in every direction

2256
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:06,100
this is just a description

2257
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:09,200
It's not that what that spirit means

2258
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,400
Just saying that every direction is restricted

2259
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,500
All directions are restricted

2260
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:15,300
so there's nothing left

2261
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:17,500
There is no such degree of freedom left

2262
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,100
So there was a speech like this

2263
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:20,500
It's not that

2264
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:21,300
so

2265
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:28,600
sorry

2266
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:29,800
because I'm not an undergraduate

2267
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,500
i want to ask

2268
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:34,600
Since the previous ratio is also graphite

2269
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:37,000
Then that graphite west is graphite

2270
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
so i heard your speech till now

2271
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,100
it feels like saying

2272
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:42,400
graphite west so so good

2273
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:43,000
so precious

2274
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
simply because it can be a very thin layer

2275
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
big piece

2276
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,800
So our front ratio is many, many

2277
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:51,000
Broken graphite west piled together

2278
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
OK

2279
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,200
It's not broken, it's a very regular arrangement

2280
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:55,800
right

2281
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,100
you

2282
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,800
In fact, if you spend so much together

2283
01:31:58,800 --> 01:31:59,800
it will automatically

2284
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,340
line up because it is the lowest energy

2285
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:07,440
That graphite is what we go to the heart of thousands of miles

2286
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,940
The distance between each layer

2287
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:13,660
Probably, this is less than one

2288
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:15,880
Is a few of the collar three Answeron

2289
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:18,240
That's 0.3 nanometers

2290
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:21,080
That means, you take one

2291
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:22,840
then it lined up well

2292
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:26,160
Sometimes the direction is a little bit wrong, it doesn't matter

2293
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:28,760
But it's layer by layer, well piled up

2294
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:32,760
not to say that standard

2295
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:35,260
Perfect like this, but roughly

2296
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:37,160
this direction, this is

2297
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:39,360
Do it perpendicular to this, there is no problem

2298
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,260
So what about its permutation?

2299
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:42,560
you can imagine saying

2300
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,260
that millimeter

2301
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:46,060
Do you know how much a millimeter is

2302
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,060
It has about 3 million layers

2303
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:49,260
inside

2304
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:52,360
so so well lined up

2305
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:55,560
So, usually you take a piece

2306
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:58,460
Take the heart of thousands of miles down, it's a big piece, a lot of piles

2307
01:32:58,660 --> 01:32:59,760
didn't split it

2308
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:00,760
because

2309
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,680
Why did you say it was made this time?

2310
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:05,080
This is a pretty good situation

2311
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:07,380
Everyone wants to say take it apart

2312
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:10,480
It's not that I can't think of a good way to separate it

2313
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:13,480
Now there are still some chemical ways to separate it

2314
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:15,940
That is to say, for example, if you bring graphite

2315
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:19,480
you put some other molecules in between

2316
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:20,740
Or nourish it

2317
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:24,480
Or put those things in OH to fill it up

2318
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,080
then it swells

2319
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:28,340
Yes, expand it and put it in agriculture

2320
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:31,180
It strips off every layer and every layer

2321
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:33,180
So this is also a method

2322
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:35,140
chemical method

2323
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:36,340
Because I still don't understand

2324
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:36,980
so ask

2325
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:38,380
Since there are many layers

2326
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:41,980
tell me if i ask a stupid question

2327
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:43,780
That is to say, it is layer by layer in nature

2328
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:45,340
Is there no way to say their

2329
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:46,700
the edge of each layer

2330
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,700
Is there any way to connect them

2331
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,380
Because if we can find such a method

2332
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:52,900
not that they are cluttered inside the pencil

2333
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,340
we just break it up

2334
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,780
Then each piece is connected

2335
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:57,080
that's what we want

2336
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
so the problem is heavy

2337
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
But the other is to say

2338
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,500
Since there are diamonds in nature

2339
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,000
Diamonds are also hard to make

2340
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Will there be graphite series in nature?

2341
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Although we humans find it difficult to do

2342
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,500
If nature had a way of forming it like this

2343
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:12,500
maybe find out

2344
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:13,500
we don't have to think

2345
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:14,500
right

2346
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,500
OK, there are graphite series in nature

2347
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:17,500
Just say two pieces together

2348
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:19,000
it will come together

2349
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
because it usually interacts

2350
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,500
Unless you have a layer of graphite

2351
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:24,500
you are on a surface

2352
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:25,500
just stand over there other stuff

2353
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:26,500
don't touch it

2354
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,000
or how does it find

2355
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,500
Now I mean, everyone think of a way to say

2356
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,000
grow it in the lab

2357
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
it's heating or something

2358
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
it grows naturally

2359
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,500
This is what everyone wants now

2360
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:38,500
if nature

2361
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:40,500
It has been achieved that it can be naturally developed into a layer

2362
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:43,000
Then we humans can find this method

2363
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
to develop it naturally into a layer

2364
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,500
Because if many layers collide

2365
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:48,500
become graphite

2366
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,500
Graphite is useless.

2367
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:55,000
because it works later

2368
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,500
it becomes it is a metal

2369
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:59,500
Then it just says less

2370
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
some nice features

2371
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
When you get to the first floor

2372
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
some other features

2373
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
will run out

2374
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
After interaction

2375
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
will offset these things

2376
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
sorry

2377
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
sorry

2378
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
i'll waste a little more time

2379
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
but you just said

2380
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
A pencil is many small flakes of graphite

2381
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
'cause they suck together

2382
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
But every little piece

2383
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
It will always have a beginning from graphite to a small piece

2384
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
but how do you pick out

2385
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
you can't your fingers so single

2386
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
How would you pick out

2387
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
you have to have a very thin

2388
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
something the size of a round paper

2389
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
clip paper to clip it out

2390
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
this is something we didn't do

2391
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
there is no way you have a round paper

2392
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
The size of the paper clip to pick out this layer

2393
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
if it can be done

2394
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Just pick that layer out

2395
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
IPN seems to have AtomTrees

2396
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Then I remember that in biochemistry

2397
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Seems like a technology called LaserTrees

2398
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
There is no way to pull a person like this

2399
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
that is to say already

2400
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
achieve a small degree of graphite west

2401
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
come out piece by piece

2402
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
If you push the trash

2403
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
It is a

2404
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
it can move a large molecule

2405
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
The space is still quite large

2406
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Graphite is an atom

2407
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
So it could have the one with thousands of atoms

2408
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
that thing it can control it

2409
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
push it move it

2410
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
There is still a difference in scale

2411
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
because

2412
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
There is still a difference in scale, the one in nanometers

2413
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
because

2414
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
you might imagine

2415
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
like nanometer

2416
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Now it's what everyone says is the sharpest thing

2417
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Because a small such a small tube

2418
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
That head is very sharp

2419
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
so you use it for some other application

2420
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
The so-called pointed one is its

2421
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
That circle is about a few nanometers

2422
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
is in the nanometer range

2423
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,000
So presumably things will never be smaller than a nanometer again.

2424
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Because smaller than nanometer

2425
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
you are about to enter the atom

2426
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
the size of an atom

2427
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
is the distance between atoms

2428
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
like this

2429
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,640
On the graphite side or in the graphite system

2430
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:07,880
The distance between judgment and detection is 0.14 difficulty

2431
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:11,200
That's probably the smallest distance

2432
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,040
right now we

2433
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,640
if you go again

2434
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:17,240
It's probably going to go into that thing in the yard box.

2435
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,640
So it's chemical

2436
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:23,240
We probably only had a few Ansejangs in mind

2437
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:24,240
on this

2438
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,720
There are plans mentioned in this major

2439
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:35,240
That is, the production of the West Rock Line has reached its physical limit.

2440
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,120
The so-called physical limit

2441
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:37,840
that is

2442
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:42,160
How long will it take you and us to reach that limit now

2443
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:43,960
or we

2444
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:45,760
almost to the limit

2445
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:48,320
But it is very difficult to reach this limit

2446
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:50,080
that could be a long time

2447
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,040
Then everyone has a lot of spirituality

2448
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:55,960
Then we look forward to having new materials to look forward to

2449
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:57,640
ok my so-called limit

2450
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:00,120
That is to say, you have a CPU

2451
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,240
How many legendary stones can be placed on the upper right

2452
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:06,600
In the end let them now be two little

2453
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:08,200
One foot is very close

2454
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:09,280
different in the middle

2455
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:12,680
Like we put some Oxide MRT

2456
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:15,080
Yes, that's already very, very thin

2457
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:16,080
the limit is

2458
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:16,880
you can't

2459
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,240
You are about a few percent thinner

2460
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,440
After a few percent of the round paper

2461
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:21,960
you probably won't be able to go down

2462
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:23,720
further down it will touch

2463
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:25,680
will affect each other

2464
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,920
so say something

2465
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,040
current design

2466
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:32,280
to the current design

2467
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:35,400
Then they probably in a certain situation

2468
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,480
no longer possible

2469
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:37,840
we can't put these things

2470
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,800
further increase

2471
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:42,160
that number for example

2472
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:45,640
The current situation in 2010 now

2473
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:47,040
maybe every one of you

2474
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,520
When each transistor operates

2475
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,280
what a nice electron

2476
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:51,600
what a current

2477
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,680
maybe it's time to say

2478
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:56,520
A dozen or twenty electrons went to operate

2479
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:58,000
so everything will come to an end

2480
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,800
go down like discreet

2481
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,840
I say this because the way it's currently designed

2482
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:08,000
The way everyone built the base to make it

2483
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,000
The purpose of finding new materials is to say

2484
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,040
If the new material has better properties

2485
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:18,500
If it is more powerful

2486
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:20,140
then we can say

2487
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:23,340
Don't go as small as that will achieve the same function

2488
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:27,740
That means doing it in another way.

2489
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:32,000
Then everyone's ballistic body over there

2490
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,840
Everyone in the industry probably has a different view

2491
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,040
that is to say you till now

2492
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:41,600
We now have a new CP coming out every year

2493
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,340
how long then

2494
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:47,740
This is what is said in the past

2495
01:39:47,740 --> 01:39:49,640
about ten or fifteen years

2496
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:56,000
That has already reached the complete limit of physics.

2497
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:59,100
The limit means that two things will meet together and cannot

2498
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:01,300
multiple

2499
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
how much can you say

2500
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,600
You have to have something to do with him

2501
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,000
How many atoms are related

2502
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
That's under several tens of atoms

2503
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
He is still a semiconductor

2504
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Or he still has a Primarch

2505
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:14,000
This is a space for discussion

2506
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,000
i mean that part

2507
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,000
i think today was a really good talk

2508
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Many friends participated

2509
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:45,000
we learned a lot of new things

2510
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
I'm an amateur at this

2511
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,000
So I have nothing to contribute

2512
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
But 20 years ago there was a cartoon

2513
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
It is said that the fastest speed for human beings to send letters in the future

2514
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:59,000
The picture above is delivered by helicopter to the door of the American cargo

2515
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
did not expect

2516
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Then ran out an E-mail out

2517
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Therefore, as the director said just now,

2518
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
how to develop in the future

2519
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
we do not know

2520
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
we will wait and see

2521
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
ok we thank you zhou
