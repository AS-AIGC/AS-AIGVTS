1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
absorption.

2
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,920
Academia Sinica's April Intellectual Education Academy Lectures Begin

3
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,720
We ask Vice President Peng Xuming to host for us

4
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,720
Goodnight everybody

5
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,840
I'm glad that today is the time we miss again

6
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,540
The topic of today's speech

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,140
The Big Sea of ​​Clouds The Science of Clouds and Their Role in the Global Environment

8
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,240
We knew this topic was very knowledgeable and interesting

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,100
Then I think the summary of this speech is for your reference.

10
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,460
Especially if you read this summary after I've heard the speech

11
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,020
will be very helpful

12
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,880
Then let me briefly introduce the speaker

13
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,560
This Dr. Huang Baoguan graduated from Tainan No. 1 Middle School in 1967

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,680
Then in 1971 take this break this meteorology

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,780
It is now the Department of Atmospheric Sciences of National Taiwan University

16
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,360
Then he served in the military for two years

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,460
That was the first year of military service for two years

18
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,780
I look for him for a year and I only support one year of military service

19
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,620
In 1970, I fell to the United States in 1971

20
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,900
1973

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,600
I just came to this UCLA to study for a Ph.D.

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,200
Then get a doctorate in seven or eight years

23
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,200
in atmospheric physics

24
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,600
Then he worked as a postdoctoral fellow and part-time assistant professor at UCLA

25
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,600
From 1980 onwards in

26
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,400
This from the University of Wisconsin Medicine

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,500
This branch served as the beginning of his academic career

28
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,400
Become an associate professor in four years and a professor in four years

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,700
Professor since 1988

30
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:41,400
Then from 1994 to 1997 served as the atmosphere

31
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,100
Dean of the Department of Marine Science

32
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:51,700
Director of the Air Resources Management Program from 1998 to 2002

33
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,800
The beginning of the year January 1, 2013

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,000
Our Central Committee is very fortunate to fight back to be our hospital

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,300
Director of the Center for Environmental Change

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,880
that in his academic career

37
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,940
Been in National Taiwan University

38
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,760
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, we call MIT

39
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,040

41
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,360
University of Mex, Germany

42
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,120
besides

43
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,420

Institute of Chemistry

46
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,520
science professor or visiting professor etc.

47
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,080
once obtained

48
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,120
America's

49
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,160
Johnson's on it

53
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,540
this

54
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,340
Senior Excellence Award

55
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,120
That

56
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,940
used to be his main research direction

57
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,220
is atmospheric physics

58
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,240
especially

59
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,300
Microphysics of clouds and rain

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,080
With the dynamic mechanism

61
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,940
Past Chair of the American Meteorological Society Committee on Cloud Physics

62
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,520
The main and more important thing is that he has a Chinese version

63
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,820
cloud physics

64
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,100
and in

65
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,380
Enthusiastic about science

66
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,620
yes there are many

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,300
popular science works

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,600
like heaven and earth

69
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,400
from Newton Press

70
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,240
Top 10 Open Books of 1996

71
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,580
Then there is a book called moving tea

72
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,360
is the culture of the world

73
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,200
It is the home of the first Wu Dayu Science Popularization Award

74
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,020
Home of the 2002 Jinling Awards

75
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,320
And Wei Sung Dae-kyeom

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,360
by Classic Magazine

77
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,700
The 2005 Jinling Award finalists and so on

78
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,740
So he is also very enthusiastic about this popular science.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,180
together we can have a good day

80
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,600
this speech we all

81
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,900
applaud him

82
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,340
Thank you Vice President

83
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,640
Goodnight everybody

84
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,740
Just now the vice president did a lot

85
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,300
too

86
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,600
It's an honor to introduce

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
not so honorable

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
but glad to have the opportunity tonight

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
let's chat

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm doing a major in one aspect of the research I'm doing

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I mean the speech has to have a nice name

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If I talk about the science of clouds all at once

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Maybe everyone doesn't want to come

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But what did I say about clouds and mountains?

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
i tricked everyone

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
let's talk slowly

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
When the dean of our society came here for an interview,

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
At that time I didn't know whether to come or not

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He told me about you this April

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He will come to us at the end of April to talk about this science in detail.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
so i thought about it

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I didn't know whether to come or not

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Later, I thought about it and said that I had promised others that I would come.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So if you don't come to this ring transformation center

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I can't seem to make sense

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm very happy to finish the show

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I just came here for 4 months

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,760
everything is not very very familiar

109
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,760
What I want to report to you today is

110
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,960
something about voice

111
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
common sense mostly common sense

112
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,460
Of course it will also mention some

113
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,760
We are more professional in the research part

114
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,760
Then my general speech is

115
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,760
I don't like too much shock

116
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,760
so hope

117
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,260
Needless to say we have to wait until all the speeches are over

118
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,020
only ask if you have a question

119
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,520
if you have something in the middle

120
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,520
small questions or relatively short

121
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
hope to understand soon

122
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
I feel free to ask

123
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,020
But if you compare the question

124
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,020
Of course we'll wait until it's all over

125
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,020
But if there is such a

126
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,020
small problem words

127
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,020
I think you are welcome to bring it up anytime

128
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,020
OK

129
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,020
Thanks

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
it doesn't seem to move

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
yes call me yes

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This has

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
yes it's ok

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
oh down ok

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
OK, thanks

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
we start from that

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
not a science start

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
so-called literature

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Or generally we are right

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This impression of the cloud is beginning to speak well

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But I'm in my Zhuzhu

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
in that insight

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
People generally think that literature is not science

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Actually a good writer

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
In fact, this kind of scientific observation has been done very carefully.

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
articles he wrote

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
to reach your heart

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
that's my point of view

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
If everyone uses this mood in the future

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
go see some litterateurs

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
books written by famous writers

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
still

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,840
or article you will find

154
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,040
In fact, they observed very carefully

155
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,200
But because he observes very carefully

156
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,040
What he writes will move your heart

157
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,540
so there's science in it

158
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,540
It's not that literature means that you don't know science

159
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,540
OK, what is our first impression of this cloud?

160
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,440
in our usual words

161
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,440
A lot of Guanye Yun about this choice is very elegant

162
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,560
Or it is very advantageous between some hatred

163
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,800
We often use language called

164
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,040
Flowing clouds and flowing water

165
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,240
On behalf of others, the writing style is very good

166
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,800
Teacher, your article is well written

167
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,000
For example, like the Controversy Exhibition in our area

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Flowing clouds and flowing water

169
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,440
that's the right word

170
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:53,960
The monk who seems to have nothing at all is called Yunshui monk

171
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,320
So this is also a kind of wandering everywhere

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
no homeless kind

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Then I just cite some examples here.

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's us, I think everyone probably

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
read these sentences

176
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
In the description of the cloud in these sentences

177
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What kind of yo-yo are they all using?

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Is that cloud Yoyo?

179
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Of course, we look at it from the eyes of ordinary people.

180
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
indeed Yoyo

181
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
it just hangs there like there's nothing going on

182
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Sometimes it takes a long time to hang

183
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Then it seems to be slightly fluttering with the wind

184
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
but i want to tell you

185
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
that was a wrong impression

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Then you were deceived by the cloud

187
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
In fact, the cloud is very busy

188
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Of course, that's from a scientist's point of view.

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll explain to you later

190
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This shadow of Yin Yun

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
have this impression

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
A few years ago, I went to this to that Italy for a meeting

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
in that so-called

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,640
That Edrisie over there in the Adriatic Sea

195
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,980
I saw this cloud early in the morning before going to a meeting here

196
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,320
Come back at four or five in the afternoon

197
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,360
The same rain is still there

198
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,920
wow that's really relaxing

199
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,020
That place seems to have just the right day and the weather is very good

200
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,360
From this island, one can see that the cloud in the distance is

201
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,900
Strange hanging all day

202
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:33,280
So if you just look at this phenomenon, you should think that the cloud is really leisurely.

203
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,340
It's all right hanging there like that bum sweat

204
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,420
But what?

205
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,280
When I was going to talk about it, it was also an illusion cloud. You thought he was hanging there all the time.

206
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,340
In fact, it's already different

207
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,900
As for why it is different

208
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,940
you will understand later

209
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,260
But your leisure will be punished

210
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,320
Some people also made this cloud

211
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,860
this one

212
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,160
This gentleman is called Laihu

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
that's what he's talking about

214
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Thousands of Lines Looking Forward Rough Sky Hard Water Nagayama

215
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Pian Fu Cong Unlimited Han Miao Ku Yi Bacteria

216
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yoyo, virtuous place, do prayers

217
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
He means that the cloud is in this

218
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
no one sees over there

219
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The place no one cares about is over there

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
change

221
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But some of that

222
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Waterway, some seedlings

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
fucked to death

224
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
he doesn't go to the rain

225
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Still wandering over there

226
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So this is scolding the cloud

227
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
some people don't understand

228
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Thought this was well done

229
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
so hang him there

230
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't know what this is

231
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Actually a curse poem

232
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Cloud of Hell Round Leaf Item

233
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That is to say, the cloud is ever-changing

234
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We usually belong to the saying

235
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Baiyuncanggou

236
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It means that the world is actually changing

237
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
very very big

238
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This source is from this

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
from a poem by dufoe

240
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It is "Heaven Fu Yin Fu White Clothes"

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
poems and songs change like dogs

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
so the sentence

243
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Condensed by us into Hakuin singing dog

244
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
meaning it gets very fast

245
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
another one

246
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The same meaning is the same as the cloud circle of the world

247
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's just that things in the world change

248
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
come and go

249
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So this world is clouded

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It also means that clouds come and go

251
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This is, of course, generally speaking

252
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Observed cloud changes are very fast

253
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Usually if you like to watch the cloud

254
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I myself have loved watching clouds since I was a child.

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So study the cloud

256
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
probably not wrong

257
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Many of you here may like to watch clouds

258
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
i have one thing to say

259
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
please don't look while driving

260
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
very dangerous

261
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
because it's fascinating

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Suddenly found this problem out

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But one of the clouds is very special

264
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That is to say, when you look at you, it is equal to

265
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You just blink and it has become the same

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Do you feel like a fish is growing

267
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
then you might say take a break

268
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Or someone just called you

269
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You spread it out for another 20 seconds

270
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That fish might disappear

271
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
very strange

272
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So some people have been dreaming

273
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
that is to say the fish

274
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
How on earth is it possible to become so fast

275
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Then there is a

276
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
there is a video

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
A small movie can be

278
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You can see how the fish is changing

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
oh

280
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
can't come back

281
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
this is going to be moved above this

282
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You can see the fish have formed

283
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
maybe i see this

284
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
This is like a dog

285
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
like a cat or something

286
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,120
this is changing

287
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,720
sometimes it seems like something out of nothing

288
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,720
Sometimes it pops up out of nowhere

289
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,440
So this of course speeds up the time

290
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,200
This is a kind of time lapse to tell the truth

291
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,920
honestly this movie

292
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,480
But I have to say so you can see

293
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,720
It is said that the change of the cloud is indeed very fast.

294
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,160
and it turns into this

295
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,000
suddenly become like that

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,120
so this is

297
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,360
Why does it cause the so-called world cloud change

298
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,800
such an impression

299
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,120
Then you see this cloud now

300
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,000
Of course, it's mainly chicken clouds on sunny days

301
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,880
that under different weather conditions

302
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,840
Variations of various clouds

303
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,920
Another way

304
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,520
OK

305
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,400
So not just the kind of cloud itself

306
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,000
dynamic changes

307
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,120
Even clouds come in all shapes and sizes

308
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,880
are various changes

309
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,000
like this cloud

310
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,200
like this cloud

311
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,380
Everyone must have seen it

312
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,280
This kind of cloud is called cirrus cloud

313
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,880
It's probably very, very long

314
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,840
so often this slightly acts like a hook

315
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,080
Westerners say this is like a horse's tail

316
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,080
that ponytail cloud

317
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,000
that's true

318
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,080
It's usually shaped like this

319
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,380
very long very

320
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,380
Often the entire sky is filled with a mass of these clouds

321
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,180
That used to be in basic meteorology

322
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,180
Teachers often say that you see this kind of cloud

323
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,180
it means the weather may change

324
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,180
But sometimes I watched for a long time

325
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,180
The weather may not change

326
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,180
Weather, if you only look at clouds

327
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,180
This is not very accurate

328
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,180
That thing has changed a lot

329
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,680
But what about this cirrus cloud?

330
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,180
Cirrus clouds are actually high-altitude clouds

331
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,980
it's very high

332
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,980
usually very thin

333
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,380
What I mean by thin is thin

334
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,380
But it's not thin in terms of thickness

335
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
its possible after a few kilometers

336
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I generally think that

337
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
This seems to be within a few hundred meters.

338
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Actually no

339
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
cirrus clouds may be several kilometers away

340
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
but it's thin

341
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
so you can see right through it from the ground

342
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
so it looks like

343
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
when the sun shines

344
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
it's very very bright

345
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Because it's mostly ice crystals

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
so this kind of thing

347
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
cirrus

348
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
This is more familiar to everyone

349
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
cirrus cloud

350
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Of course there are small and big cirrus clouds

351
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
that movie we just had

352
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That is called sunny cirrus

353
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
because it was sunny

354
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
cirrus clouds

355
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
this one is bigger

356
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
This is from that accountant

357
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
founding out

358
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This is what we call dense cirrus cloud

359
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
because it grows a bit bigger

360
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Then you can see the shape

361
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I think of when you eat

362
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The kind that eats that cauliflower

363
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,240
You see cauliflower, this is gene

364
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:10,880
If you like Niu-Stopology and you see this thing, this one is convection

365
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:18,380
Why convection? There is this relative movement between the air outside and the air inside

366
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:25,780
So there are a lot here, if you look at them carefully, it looks like a small team bag

367
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,780
keep moving

368
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:33,020
I saw it when I was a kid, I practiced this reservoir very early

369
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,180
This is Yun Zhongjun from Chuchi Nine Brothers

370
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:43,660
This is one of the ancient cloud gods

371
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:50,780
In his commentary, I just wanted to laugh when I saw it, Yun Zhongjun is Yunshen Fenglong

372
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:55,620
I believe that name is all about being there

373
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,960
You see this kind of gene, it really looks fat

374
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Of course it's very windy

375
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
He said another name is Ping Yi

376
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
This simplicity simply means to block things.

377
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Of course, the cloud is blocking the sun

378
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So this god's name is probably a bit artificial.

379
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This kind of cloud you often see this so-called achievement

380
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You say like it's not full of the sky

381
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But you can divide it piece by piece

382
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So this kind of cloud is also full

383
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The other one is called a convective cloud

384
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Convective clouds are

385
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Usually its vertical scale is a bit larger than its horizontal scale

386
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So this is generally produced by convection

387
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Then this is of course the cloudy weather in summer in Taiwan.

388
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And this kind of cloud you usually see

389
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
More likely means that there is a chance of rain often

390
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Also this kind of cloud, since it is so thick, it means

391
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Some of his ascenders are very strong

392
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Some ascenders are so strong

393
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There is a high chance of rain

394
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But it's also a possibility

395
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
If you say he will definitely rain

396
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Not always

397
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
sometimes he can't get down

398
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But the so-called not coming down means not getting down to the ground

399
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
if you are in the rain

400
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
then he will come down

401
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
If you go back into the rain

402
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There are many raindrops on that window

403
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
On that glass of this plane

404
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
you can see

405
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
There must be strong raindrops in this convective rain

406
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
when a convective rain

407
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Like when I grew up in a tall place just now

408
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
This usually reaches a certain height

409
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That height we call convective sinking

410
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The lowest layer of the atmosphere on the ground

411
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
We call it convective sinking

412
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Basically, he arrived at about 10 kilometers.

413
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,400
sometimes ten kilometers

414
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,600
onto that

415
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,400
another city

416
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,600
There is probably Stratocity over ten kilometers away.

417
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,800
Stratocity-like movement is difficult to penetrate

418
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,200
So the general cloud goes to this convective city

419
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,000
It's like there's an invisible glass blocking it

420
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,800
your convection basin to the top

421
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,600
its cloud won't go up

422
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
But it can always be opened from the side

423
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,600
So it has this kind of opening on both sides

424
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,200
So this so-called chicken cloud

425
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,800
Chicken clouds are generally connected with the so-called lightning phenomenon

426
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,200
Usually it produces lightning and thunder

427
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,800
this phenomenon

428
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,200
This is the so-called chicken cloud

429
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,000
Just now, it was probably the general impression we have of clouds.

430
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,300
what is it like

431
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:56,600
Let me see what the artist thinks about this cloud

432
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
this belt this

433
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,560
A painter named Guo Xi

434
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,600
Everyone, if you go to the Boyuan of the Forbidden City

435
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,900
There are several very large paintings

436
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,500
He once wrote an article called "Linquan Gaozhi"

437
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,060
He narrates a lot in it

438
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,860
If you want to draw clouds, how should you draw them?

439
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,160
Of course he mainly said

440
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,200
The clouds in spring should be like white cranes

441
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,740
The wind is blowing

442
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,280
This makes sense

443
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,580
Because the convection is stronger in summer

444
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,360
Just like the convection just now

445
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,160
so summer clouds

446
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,520
A lot of them are like this kind of strange mountain.

447
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,080
autumn and winter clouds

448
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,860
Each has its own characteristics

449
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,420
that this

450
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,960
Later this

451
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,040
It may be the ring garden in the Ming Dynasty

452
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,620
In the picture book, it is a great article about the cloud coming to heaven and earth

453
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,720
Qianyan of Mountains and Rivers is too busy in the future

454
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,780
You have to draw some clouds when you draw too much this Qianyan

455
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,340
make him look slanted

456
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,900
After that request, I am too willing to do so

457
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What are you going to do because there are so few things?

458
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You also draw some shadows, he looks a little busy

459
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
So this has this wonderful effect

460
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I think what he said is quite reasonable.

461
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I found two examples, the first one is

462
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
These two are from the Yuan Dynasty. Wang Meng has one called

463
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Juquling Wutu, what about this pot?

464
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Wang Meng is of course a Taoist of the Yuan Dynasty

465
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So of course his brush is very good

466
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But I think this earth dragon is too urgent

467
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's like I can't breathe

468
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The densely packed trees he drew are also stones

469
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
If he can draw a little cloud in the middle

470
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Looks like it's more likely not to be in such a hurry

471
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
The other easel is better for him

472
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
He has a lot of mountains and fields, but there are some clouds in the middle of him.

473
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Of course, the so-called cloud is actually the same as there is no painting

474
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
mostly blank

475
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So it seems less urgent

476
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
he doesn't feel like he can't breathe

477
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So the cloud does have this magical effect

478
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Like this is Dong Qicha from the Ming Dynasty, Shu Hua's family

479
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
He's not really that professional a painter

480
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Three strokes and two strokes of literati paintings by him

481
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So he didn't have much time to draw in such detail

482
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So he used the awareness just now

483
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
He said that you, Zhuo Yi, are too suspicious of a male Yun Mangzi

484
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You just use that cloud to make it look like there's something in it

485
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So what he actually painted is the black place.

486
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
this place is left blank

487
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
But you seem to say it's a cloud

488
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I would imagine that there might be trees behind that cloud

489
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Actually he didn't say that

490
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But that's what's in your head

491
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
There must be something behind that cloud

492
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So this is the so-called Zhuo Yi too disliked

493
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Male Yun Manzi makes him look a little more manly

494
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
this is not bad

495
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Therefore, Chinese painters

496
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
There are many theories of phonetics

497
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
But the modern voice

498
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
That is to say, the voice painting in this Chinese painting is the best

499
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It may be the late Mr. Huang Junbi

500
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
His nickname is Master of Baiyun Hall

501
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So I think he's already very, very confident with this voice painting

502
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
That's true, his voice and painting are quite good.

503
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
He painted voices better than those painters of previous generations

504
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
He draws more realistically

505
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So this one is one of his rhythms

506
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
He often mentions a

507
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Looking at the green mountains and deep white clouds are all the feelings of hometown

508
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
also very realistic

509
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But I have one dissatisfaction with our Chinese painter

510
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Dissatisfaction is that

511
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Half the day they drew his clouds looked the same

512
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
He didn't try to draw other clouds

513
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
He also didn't try to draw cloud shadows

514
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,700
Its camp is basically next to the mountain

515
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,200
Then there are some clouds

516
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,500
So after talking for half a day

517
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,500
The main purpose of its cloud painting is to set off the mountains

518
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
That's all

519
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
So although it has a lot of theory about painting clouds

520
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
it doesn't really execute

521
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,000
How should the cloud be drawn, how to draw, how to draw

522
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
So at least I read a lot about the Forbidden City.

523
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It seems that I haven't really found a serious one.

524
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Example of drawing that different cloud

525
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,800
But speaking of Western paintings

526
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
It's almost like that in ancient times

527
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
it doesn't matter

528
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
When we draw clouds, we draw a cloud

529
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,800
And the cloud in the ancient western paintings is not the main character

530
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
Ancient paintings are all figures

531
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,300
so be the protagonist

532
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,800
Then draw a cloud in that least heavy corner

533
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,800
It seems like a place full of clouds

534
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,800
This probably lasted until the Impressionist came out.

535
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,800
I really started to pay attention to that cloud

536
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,800
Draw that cloud very realistically

537
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
And not only the clouds are very realistic

538
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,800
That kind of scene turns into clouds and shines on each other

539
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Various coordination between online

540
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
very well drawn

541
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
This is the master of impressionism

542
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
his master

543
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
This one is called Caude Monet

544
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
painted

545
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
He speaks from the point of view of this cloudy school

546
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
he drew it exactly right

547
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Exactly like Convection Shadow

548
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Ba Xiao

549
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And where should his shadow be?

550
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Then the bottom should look like

551
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I have nothing to say

552
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
that's him

553
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Indeed, the painting is very, very

554
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
lifelike

555
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
just that part

556
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I think

557
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
although i can't draw

558
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
but i think

559
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
if you study hard

560
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
very well said

561
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
But after I saw this

562
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I said that there is nothing I can do about it

563
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I don't think I can draw this

564
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
my first time in

565
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm in Paris, France

566
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
that

567
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I was actually at a place called Caude Pong

568
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
that that that that

569
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
when i saw this picture

570
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
just thought about it

571
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Somebody come in and really can draw

572
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
get this cloud out

573
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,800
One of the reasons is that

574
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,100
The first one I am very sensitive to this cloud

575
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,300
Every time the sky derails this cloud

576
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,000
My whole body is uncomfortable

577
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,400
I just said I've been thinking about it for a long time and I can't figure it out

578
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,500
Later I figured out why

579
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
so i'll explain later

580
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,700
But I've ever felt that way

581
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,700
That is, if anyone can take the cloud

582
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,800
That kind of cloud can be drawn with that brush

583
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,500
I admire it very much

584
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,700
I ended up visiting this museum.

585
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,700
There is such a painting in this demon

586
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,400
This means it's not sunny

587
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,100
but it's not raining

588
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,400
It's half sunny and half rainy

589
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,500
at a glance

590
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,300
When I saw it, I felt that the cloud was really uncomfortable.

591
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,600
That's an amazing art too

592
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,300
So this is very, very powerful

593
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,600
I don't see anyone else drawing

594
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,200
draw it like this

595
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,700
that mentioned why

596
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,000
Just look at this picture first

597
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
This one is the so-called high-speed luck

598
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You may often see this

599
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
What impression do you usually have when you see this kind of luck?

600
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
what kind of weather do you usually live in

601
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
See what Gao Jiyun looks like

602
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
like a fish spirit

603
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Does anyone care to guess

604
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Or tell me about your usual impression

605
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
actually not

606
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
This kind of luck is good when the weather is good

607
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yulingtian

608
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
This kind of high-speed luck is usually when the sky is better

609
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
and the background can often be seen through

610
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
see above that blue sky

611
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
This is actually mentioned in many elementary and middle school textbooks

612
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
But when he mentioned it he often said

613
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
If you see this cloud like fish spirit

614
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
yes means sunny

615
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I think this sentence is a bit redundant

616
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
This sentence is of course true

617
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So this is of little significance, it should be like this, that is to say, if you see this kind of cloud, and then it becomes a piece, and becomes a whole cloud, it means that the weather is going to be bad

618
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Why? Because when you have this kind of cloud, it usually represents small-scale convection, one by one small convection packets, and it is not very deep, it is a small and shallow convection, so it is not itself not thick

619
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But if they are connected together, it means that there is a large-scale movement approaching, so the whole air will rise upwards

620
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:52,000
When you see this convection, some of the air rises and some of it goes down, but when you see the whole becomes one piece, then the weather starts to get bad

621
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
If it's the other way around, you first see a large layer of cloud formation, and then come on, it suddenly becomes this

622
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
the weather will get better

623
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
This situation means that when I was a freshman or sophomore

624
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I just learned a little bit about this

625
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
very happy

626
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I just got married

627
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
it rained heavily that morning

628
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Of course everyone is very troubled

629
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It's finally raining

630
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It's inconvenient to get married when it rains

631
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Trouble with guests

632
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Sometimes I told him that I hadn't studied the heptathlon

633
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Soon about ten o'clock

634
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I saw that the blue sky began to have a few pieces of this small

635
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
This kind of high-speed machine looks like it came out

636
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm bold enough to tell my father

637
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Don't worry, the weather will improve

638
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Sure enough, more than an hour

639
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Slowly and slowly the whole cost becomes the whole rain

640
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
slowly become like this

641
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
rain like rain

642
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
In the afternoon, it was simply the situation.

643
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So I'm very impressed with doing

644
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's a good day to see high altitude clouds

645
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Everyone knows about this painting

646
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
The problem is that you want to change the shape of the cloud from this

647
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
go see what the weather will be like

648
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
which is more important

649
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
so you want to understand this

650
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Of course you need to understand

651
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Where did this cloud come from?

652
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
so after knowing this

653
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It's more interesting to look at the cloud

654
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Some western flower family even even clouds

655
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Those were a little more static

656
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
The painting is a little dynamic

657
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
because it draws clouds

658
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
This is clearly a dense cloud

659
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
and it's beyond the clouds

660
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
look at the windy direction

661
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
sometimes see that cloud

662
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
especially in autumn

663
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
The higher wind is stronger

664
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It can blow clouds from side to side

665
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
you can see this cloud

666
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
so-called wind shear

667
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
so it's obvious

668
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
The wind on this upper level blows from the right to the left

669
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
This is an American painter's Junker

670
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,080
He just made it so that he wasn't really one of us.

671
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,380
But the scenery he painted

672
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,580
It’s just the scenery near the Metis where I live

673
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,580
exactly like this

674
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,080
some countryside then some trees

675
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,880
And did you see that autumn really is

676
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,420
This very high cloud then goes in a certain direction

677
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,000
I just asked my students

678
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,500
After you see this painting, is there any way to warm it up on the ground?

679
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,340
As the altitude changes then the wind on the ground follows the wind direction at altitude

680
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,340
We call the explorer refusal, is there a way to write it out?

681
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,340
It should be possible

682
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:40,340
If you are familiar with the terroir of a place

683
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,840
In addition to these individual clouds just now

684
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
I have all kinds of scenery

685
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,840
Like our sea of ​​clouds, a friend of mine named Zhuang Kaihua took this picture

686
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,840
This one is in Miaoli

687
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,840
Miaoli seems to be called crow leaf or something

688
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
where we are over there

689
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
we go camping over there

690
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
We often see this in Taiwan

691
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
The whole cloud submerges the mountain like the sea

692
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
So it's a cloud phenomenon

693
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
often in the valley

694
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
early in the morning

695
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
maybe the weather is nice

696
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But slowly the wind blows

697
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
you can see the whole valley

698
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
empty full of clouds

699
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
a piece exactly like the sea

700
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So this sea of ​​clouds is really like a sea of ​​clouds

701
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Yunshan is really a mountain

702
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
This is the plane I took

703
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Already flew at a peak of about 12,000 meters

704
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
But because of the clouds above

705
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
taller than this plane

706
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Twelve thousand meters

707
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
world's highest peak

708
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Come to Mount Everest this time

709
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Or I will code the wind in mainland China

710
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,800
Only more than 8000 less than 9000 meters

711
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,920
So if you move Inoki male king to

712
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,200
same place

713
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,720
still below

714
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,060
Clouds in our Taiwan summer

715
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,620
It's just ten kilometers

716
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,940
The kind of summer that makes cloud-based tops

717
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,240
About 12 to 13 kilometers

718
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,260
At least

719
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,860
When it is more vigorous, sometimes 15

720
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,140
15 6 km

721
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,420
are very high clouds

722
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,760
Your so-called highest peak in the world is actually still

723
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,800
still much lower than that

724
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:34,820
Simply

725
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,360
89 kilometers like this

726
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,480
This is also based on

727
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,300
This is all you can see if you look at him from a plane based on

728
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,880
Basically, it grows long and long from a very low place a few hundred meters

729
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,160
grow to

730
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,180
ten kilometers high

731
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,500
So if you haven't been to this Everest

732
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,300
if moved in front of your eyes

733
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,580
how high will it be

734
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,580
It's not really that high

735
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So this can give you a better reference point is

736
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Of course not all clouds are happy

737
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Some clouds look a little scary

738
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
This is called a milky advanced cloud

739
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
This is usually in this kind of cloud with this storm

740
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
very relevant cloud

741
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You can see it this below

742
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Round and round, a bit like that cow

743
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Saggy bunch of this cow's milk like

744
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
So we call it milky high cloud

745
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I remember Li He in the Tang Dynasty

746
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Also wrote a poem called Black Cloud

747
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Duck City Chen Yuchui

748
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
The false light is like golden clouds blooming on the sun

749
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
he wrote this scene

750
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I think it's exactly like the scene I took that time

751
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
This is the so-called milky advanced cloud

752
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
how did this come about

753
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
now everyone is arguing

754
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
have different theories

755
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
But why would he cause

756
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
It just so happens that this kind of spherical shape is very strange.

757
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Gao Jin's advocacy just now also looks strange.

758
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But it's not scary

759
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
This movie is more scary

760
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
This shadow is what we call the strong shadow

761
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Walk on

762
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
basically you can see this ground

763
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
This shadow is like a big one of this kind

764
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Vacuum cleaner blows down from the sky again

765
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
If you just stood below

766
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
The hot water is sucked up

767
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
It's like an alien machine

768
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Of course you see this cloud

769
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
i think you better run faster

770
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Because this kind of shadow is the precursor of a tornado

771
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
This cloud usually appears

772
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Signs of a tornado

773
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
This wall-like circle of clouds

774
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Then it's slowly turning

775
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,700
That tornado doesn't seem to appear slowly

776
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,800
some slowly

777
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,000
but there are

778
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,300
when you look happy like this

779
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,000
it came suddenly

780
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Maybe it's right in front of your eyes

781
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,800
Suddenly a tornado appeared

782
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,000
it will be like this

783
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So when you see this cloud phenomenon

784
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
This is to find a place to hide

785
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
or lower your voice

786
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Maybe it's safer

787
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Those just now are not very scientific

788
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
those are a chat

789
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
let's take a look now

790
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Where did the cloud come from?

791
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
The elements of the cloud are not there in the end

792
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
That's it

793
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
First

794
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Clouds must have water vapor

795
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Clouds must have water vapor

796
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
We say that clouds are mainly made of water

797
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
If you have another smoke cause

798
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
that doesn't count

799
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Speaking of this water vapor

800
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
you mention again

801
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Here we sometimes talk about the so-called man-made cloud

802
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,740
Say wow, no, we are in a drought, we need to hurry up and make rain

803
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,640
But drought, what does drought mean?

804
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,340
You are almost out of water

805
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:15,040
True droughts are very, very rare in representations of water in the air

806
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,880
absolutely not

807
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,180
How do you make rain when you have no water at all?

808
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,440
no way

809
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,780
So I made a skylight question, do you have any comments?

810
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,880
What is the south of the bridge, what is nothing, what is known

811
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,760
Anyone want to try it?

812
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,560
In fact, this is not an answer, the answer is up to you

813
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,860
say what you want

814
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,280
I made this

815
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,120
if you have no water at all

816
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,920
Even if you are a god, you cannot create clouds

817
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,000
There is no water to make it, you are making too much of this

818
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,840
It's useless to throw away stippling silver or something like that

819
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,920
So if you want clouds, first of all, of course you must form water

820
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Sometimes there is water vapor, but sometimes there is no cloud, why?

821
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Because the water vapor has to be saturated to be able to

822
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So the second one is that you have to reach saturation

823
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
What does it mean to be saturated?

824
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
The first one is that your water vapor content must be sufficient

825
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Second, sometimes there is a lot of water vapor, you will feel very stuffy

826
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
But the sky is still very bright with few and no clouds

827
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
But you feel dazed and sad, why?

828
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Because it has not reached saturation, then under what circumstances will it reach saturation

829
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
That kind of saturation has a lot to do with temperature and air temperature.

830
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Therefore, the water vapor content and the temperature must be coordinated with each other.

831
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
to saturate the cloud

832
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
These two things are actually related to the movement of air.

833
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
What is air movement called?

834
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
air movement that is called wind

835
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Of course it's wind and water

836
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
just one of them

837
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Usually we call horizontal movement

838
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
is called the wind

839
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
The wind from east to west, from north to south

840
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
This is to say that the air is a horizontal movement

841
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
But the air has to move up and down

842
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
At that time it was not called the wind

843
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
updraft or downdraft

844
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
then this is

845
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
turn this

846
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
talk about this up and down

847
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
general cloud formation

848
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
updraft relationship

849
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
relatively close

850
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
comparison means

851
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
some in

852
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
There are of course other possibilities under individual circumstances.

853
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
but the updraft

854
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
The relationship is particularly great

855
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
that might

856
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
a little unforgettable

857
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
That is to say, the horizontal movement of the air is

858
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
What is the difference in vertical movement?

859
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
This difference is very large

860
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
just with you

861
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
usually walk on flat road

862
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
follow you up the mountain

863
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Also walk a mile to see

864
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Generally similar

865
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,540
you see this is different

866
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,940
But for the air

867
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,740
what is its biggest difference

868
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,440
its biggest difference

869
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,540
vertical movement of air

870
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,740
The change in air pressure it experiences is very large

871
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,340
if you level

872
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,940
it doesn't change air pressure

873
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,740
In general, a large area

874
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,140
its air pressure is about the same

875
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,940
So your air if in the same area

876
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,140
move around

877
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,540
If it is a horizontal movement

878
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,140
its air pressure hasn't changed

879
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,740
But if it is vertical

880
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,180
it's totally different

881
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,980
Ordinary air, if it runs upwards,

882
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,580
what consequences will it have

883
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,580
when an air goes up

884
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,980
The pressure outside is suddenly less

885
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,180
we all know

886
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,740
The higher the altitude, the thinner the air

887
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,480
right

888
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,080
some people have mountain sickness

889
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,140
That altitude sickness is another

890
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,580
But Takayama has a very serious

891
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,040
In the mountains, the air is thinner

892
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,380
Some people are not used to it

893
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,280
Some people even outside

894
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
will be confused

895
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,340
that almost everyone

896
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,340
except for local residents

897
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,340
If you go to the mountain with a height of about 5,000 meters

898
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,340
Almost all of them will come across more or less

899
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,840
So, for example, when it comes to the shoreland 13 in South America

900
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,840
That place is five or six thousand meters

901
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,840
People who are not used to it can't stand that height

902
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,840
why

903
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,340
Because it is very air-absorbing

904
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,340
The air is very attracted to you

905
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,340
Inhaled air, the oxygen content is not enough

906
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:31,340
Let you this can't produce enough heat

907
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,340
So this air is getting more and more absorbed

908
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,340
This is a very important phenomenon

909
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,340
when you have a cloud of air

910
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,340
when going up

911
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,340
outside air adsorption

912
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,340
on behalf of

913
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,340
Because the air is supposed to have pressure, right?

914
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,340
Then you are under so much pressure

915
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,340
When it rises suddenly, the pressure outside it decreases

916
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,340
Then it will start to expand outward

917
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,340
What will be the consequences of this expansion in the past?

918
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,340
If a mass of air expands outward

919
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
without other sources of heat

920
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,500
It's one of the greatest possibilities it will get cold

921
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,500
So when an air it expands

922
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
As it rises and expands it cools

923
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,500
Once it got cold, there was some water vapor in it

924
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,500
The water vapor is originally called unsaturated

925
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,500
Because under the condition of relatively high temperature

926
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,000
it does not reach saturation

927
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,000
But when you get cold

928
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,500
It may slowly this saturation

929
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Higher and higher

930
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,500
it may not necessarily reach saturation

931
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,500
but maybe 90 percent saturated

932
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Then lift it up

933
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,000
In the end it really saturates

934
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,500
As long as the air goes up

935
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,500
it's getting colder

936
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,000
cloud of dry air

937
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,500
Or even a cloud of air with water vapor in it

938
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,500
it goes up

939
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,500
As long as there is no condensation

940
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,000
it lifts a kilometer

941
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,500
it's about ten degrees lower

942
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
so cold

943
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
A cloud of air is on the ground if twenty degrees

944
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,000
You lifted it two thousand meters

945
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
it will be zero degrees freezing point

946
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
So this is a big change

947
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
A cloud of air rises two meters from the ground, after two thousand meters

948
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Alishan Alishan is not even 2,000 meters away

949
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
If a cloud of air rises from the ground to the height of Alishan

950
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
The air inside can become freezing point.

951
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
then you may find it strange

952
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
But Alishan is not always freezing point

953
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Of course the so-called what I just said is

954
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
That is only if the air has movement

955
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
But usually the air in Alishan is not from sports.

956
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
That's another mechanic, that's another story

957
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I won't mention it for now

958
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
What I want to mention here is that

959
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
If you have a cloud of air rising up the table

960
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
For two kilometers, it was originally twenty degrees and it became zero degrees.

961
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Because every kilometer it cools down ten degrees

962
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
The same cloud of air if from a high altitude

963
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
sinking for some reason

964
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It's going to be a day and it's going to be a very very day

965
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
This is actually thermodynamics

966
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Thermodynamics means

967
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Adiabatic expansion cools

968
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Adiabatic compression heats an air

969
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Then this thing with a

970
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
it has something to do with your flight

971
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Usually we fly

972
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
start from the ground

973
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
The ground air probably has us or something

974
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
around 1000 mbar

975
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
You fly so high

976
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
About 200 millibars left

977
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
so the air has

978
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
That pressure has been reduced by 1.5

979
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
if that air

980
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
If the cabin doesn't pressurize the air

981
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
you will feel very sad

982
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Because the air is too thin

983
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So the captain must use

984
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
big compressor

985
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
press that air to

986
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
very stressful

987
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
almost as big as the ground

988
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
sometimes say 90%

989
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
and put that air in

990
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
into this cabin to let you

991
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
let you breathe

992
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
you will feel very natural

993
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Then we just talked about the air

994
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
So if you compress that

995
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
it gets hot

996
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Will high altitude be able to?

997
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,240
When the captain sucks in the air

998
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,740
Then heat it up and put it in

999
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,540
If it doesn't put this air

1000
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,420
after that cold

1001
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,920
if the air conditioner cools it down

1002
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,920
The temperature is about 60 degrees

1003
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,420
everyone will be hot

1004
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,420
Rick it's all over

1005
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:23,120
So when it shakes this air into the cabin

1006
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,160
It must be air-conditioned first

1007
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,160
pump this excess heat off

1008
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,160
So that consumes a very, very large amount of energy

1009
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,160
It is to put this pressurized hot air

1010
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,160
let it cool down and put it in this cabin

1011
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,160
So this is a very, very fuel-intensive thing

1012
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,160
Even if you still have to spend some oil to deal with these problems

1013
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,160
Even if the temperature outside the cabin at that time

1014
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,160
maybe minus sixty or seventy degrees

1015
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,160
It still needs to get this air to cool it down

1016
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,160
Relying on the outside air temperature is not enough

1017
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,440
Use this air conditioner to send the cooling back in again

1018
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,860
So this is called the expansion of the air

1019
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:13,240
A very important reason for the cooling of the camp

1020
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,480
So basically come this is called

1021
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,960
The basic mechanism is

1022
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,080
The mechanism of forming a camp is mainly here

1023
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,200
A cloud of air with water vapor

1024
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,080
it cools as it goes up

1025
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,120
because of swelling

1026
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,240
after cooling

1027
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,080
It will reach saturation

1028
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,920
Once saturated

1029
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,640
In theory its condensation should produce

1030
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,400
At that time you will see the clouds come out

1031
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,040
So the picture below represents a cloud

1032
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,880
A basic mechanism of cloud formation

1033
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,720
A mass of air has no water droplets in it

1034
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,080
but there is water vapor

1035
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,080
Go up and slowly get bigger and bigger

1036
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,600
to a certain extent

1037
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,160
to a certain extent

1038
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,400
After they are saturated with water vapor,

1039
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,960
Ectopic Concrete

1040
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
By this time you should see that cloud start to come out

1041
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
This is the so-called bottom of the cloud, the cloud base is starting to come out

1042
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And the cloud if it still has enough water in it

1043
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
it will keep going up and you can see the clouds

1044
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
keep showing up and that weird place

1045
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
That is to say, once it has an air lift up

1046
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
The other air pocket below is probably coming up from the same place

1047
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Because once you have one air and one goes up

1048
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
You can easily drive other places to bring in the air

1049
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And from there the new air rises up

1050
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
The new air has other new sources of water vapor in it

1051
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
So you see a cloud rising far away

1052
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
it's cause like this up out

1053
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So let's talk nonsense, let's watch this kind of cloud-making movie

1054
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
This is the so-called move of Yundi just now

1055
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
We can see the phenomenon we just mentioned

1056
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
you see it keeps going up

1057
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I can't see anything below why

1058
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
because of water vapor

1059
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Water vapor is so transparent you can't see it at all

1060
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
In fact the air is always going up

1061
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
But because it is transparent

1062
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
contains water vapor

1063
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
so you can't see

1064
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
you can't see it going up

1065
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
In fact, there are constantly new air bags

1066
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
come in here

1067
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
then always

1068
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
for this cloud

1069
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
A lot of new water vapor comes out

1070
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
If there is enough water vapor in a place,

1071
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Clouds can always go up

1072
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
even grown to thunder and lightning

1073
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Why does the air go up

1074
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
wait a second

1075
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,880
The little teacher didn't want to see through everyone's past

1076
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,280
wait a minute let me see

1077
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,380
You asked exactly the topic I chose

1078
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,180
Why does the air rise so high

1079
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,500
there are several theories

1080
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,400
several reasons

1081
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,280
The first is convection

1082
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,780
under the same air pressure

1083
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,080
If the air in this place is warmer

1084
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,980
Its density will become a little lighter

1085
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,580
So it creates a force

1086
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,240
For a light air is like

1087
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,440
an air bubble in water

1088
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,040
relatively small density

1089
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,440
So it will rise with a force

1090
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,740
So this is one of the first

1091
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:40,440
Usually this convection is called free convection

1092
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,240
because it's all temperature dependent

1093
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,540
The first is a forced convection

1094
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,740
forced convection

1095
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,940
inside the weather inside the air

1096
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,140
This is usually

1097
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,640
For example, there is a very cold air

1098
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,840
Very cold air generally

1099
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,040
it's a bit heavier

1100
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,040
when it starts moving

1101
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
There are many things moving, and the rotation of the earth will also drive it

1102
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
It doesn't rotate at the same time as the earth

1103
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
It sometimes spins at a different speed than the Earth

1104
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
So anyway, it still has relative motion with the ground

1105
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Then once such cold air moves

1106
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
it will make the front lighter

1107
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
or warmer air would be lifted by it

1108
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The air, the air in front is not necessarily warmer

1109
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
But it is also forced by it

1110
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Because of its sense of movement is forced by it

1111
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
it winds it up like an opener

1112
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
So it's called compulsive, compulsive uplifting

1113
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Then once the air may be reluctant

1114
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
It is unwilling to rise, but because of its movement

1115
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
so be lifted by it

1116
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
What should I do after I lift it up? It's the same

1117
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It also expands and cools when lifted

1118
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Then come the clouds

1119
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
That's because this kind of movement usually has a larger scale

1120
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So it's whole, it's a movement

1121
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
The whole floor has gone up

1122
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
So the clouds you see act like clouds

1123
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,400
Because the large area is full of clouds

1124
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,400
That hair is the weather will get worse

1125
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,400
because it is a large-scale movement

1126
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,400
that's why i just said

1127
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,900
If it was a high-flying

1128
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,400
And then it becomes the whole layer all connected

1129
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,400
the weather may turn bad

1130
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,400
It is because of this large-scale movement

1131
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,400
The other is volatility

1132
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,400
Fluctuations This is usually caused by relatively small movements

1133
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,400
The so-called fluctuation is like water waves

1134
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,400
Water wave, you throw away the silk and go into the water

1135
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,400
Look at it spreading out in waves

1136
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,400
A wave spreads out as if moving

1137
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,400
But the water itself is not flowing

1138
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,400
The water itself is actually just moving up and down

1139
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,400
But that wave looks like it's been running out

1140
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,400
it just runs outside

1141
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,400
The water itself must be flowing

1142
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,400
If you throw a piece of wood on the water

1143
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,400
The log didn't run away either

1144
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,400
The wood just moves up and down in place for a while.

1145
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,400
So this is called volatility

1146
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,260
have this up and down movement

1147
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,740
whatever the reason

1148
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,160
as long as you move up

1149
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,440
air will expand

1150
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,800
will condense into clouds

1151
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,160
So all kinds of clouds come out

1152
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,400
This is a lot of individual convection generation that you saw just now

1153
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,040
This is relatively large

1154
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,300
is usually you will see something like this

1155
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:25,440
The whole big cloud

1156
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,100
How much does it rain

1157
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,500
or the light rain in the big rain building

1158
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,940
Of course not to say rainstorm

1159
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:35,100
It's unlikely

1160
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,260
If there is no wind, will there be clouds?

1161
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:41,140
We usually talk about wind and clouds

1162
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:44,800
So there must be wind and there must be clouds

1163
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,900
But we used to have one that hurt

1164
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,500
the great poet this du fu

1165
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,500
He has a Qingzhou miscellaneous stone

1166
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,400
Generally twenty hands, this is the seventh hand

1167
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,500
He has a boundless mountain, an isolated city, and a valley

1168
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,000
Wu Fengyun promotes the sun

1169
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,400
If you are unemployed, you will be more critical

1170
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,600
The two most famous of these are the

1171
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,800
Then this unemployed is getting closer

1172
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,900
Then this is astronomical

1173
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,200
Leave it to the people at the astronomical institute to explain

1174
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,200
A college student from Houhou Earth Institute can also explain

1175
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,500
then i want to explain

1176
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,700
Will no wind and cloud block

1177
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,920
If there is no wind, will it

1178
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,200
will the clouds come out

1179
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,500
that's certainly possible

1180
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,900
Because I mentioned it for a long time

1181
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,600
It doesn't have to be windy

1182
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,700
you can still have clouds

1183
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,300
pop up

1184
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,600
this is for volatility

1185
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,800
it's just at dusk

1186
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,600
You can see that there are actually many fluctuations in the air

1187
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,200
Air is like water

1188
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,300
same thing

1189
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
moving from time to time

1190
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,400
What if the air humidity is just right?

1191
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,000
You see just created a cloud

1192
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,200
Usually this tail is invisible

1193
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,500
because it's usually thin

1194
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,300
Good luck after giving birth on this day

1195
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,800
The sun just shines from that angle

1196
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,100
show you this thin eye

1197
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
So it should be seen that this place is actually a large part of the whole wave

1198
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Just at the place where the height of the wave is the highest, where the wave wind

1199
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
some clouds will come out

1200
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Why do clouds form where the wind blows?

1201
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Because the place where the wave is square is of course where the air rises

1202
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Usually an ancient place like this is where the air sinks

1203
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
There are no clouds in most places

1204
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
this day is special

1205
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
It's more humid

1206
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
So there will be clouds even in this place that day

1207
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
But this place the clouds are thicker

1208
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
So this cloud is a cloud produced by fluctuations

1209
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
it often looks like a lens

1210
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
So this is called lenticular

1211
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
lenticular cloud

1212
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
This is really a lenticular cloud

1213
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Sometimes you can see the sky full of clouds like this

1214
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
like a lens

1215
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
like a thick slice

1216
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
In fact, this is all generated by waves.

1217
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
This is really like playing without wind and clouds

1218
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
you can

1219
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I know it why these two doses learn well

1220
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,760
In the last section, this somewhat mysterious place

1221
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:07,000
Because it is written in such an unofficial place

1222
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,360
It mentions that there is no wind but there are clouds, coming out

1223
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,360
You feel as if there is no movement, but the enemy suddenly appears

1224
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:18,840
There's this air of absurdity coming out of your body

1225
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,240
You can imagine this place

1226
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:25,600
It seems that your officer is here, then on the opposite side of the mountain or when

1227
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:30,600
This evil slave's Qibing regiment popped up, no wind and shadow left the fortress

1228
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:39,600
I'm not saying I believe the name of the flying saucer, it may be a so-called flying saucer

1229
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,600
But our dude drinks decently, it's all right

1230
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,600
But this kind of cloud in the broken mirror sometimes looks like this

1231
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:54,600
It seems that suddenly a big tide rises and appears in the sky

1232
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:58,600
Then this is exactly the relationship that should fluctuate, especially in the mountains

1233
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,440
back then it would have a lot of these fluctuations

1234
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,600
This kind of fluctuation will produce this kind of cloud if the kind of conditions are just right

1235
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,240
This is often geographical

1236
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,800
Certain geographies are particularly prone to such clouds

1237
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,800
so you want to see ufo

1238
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,000
It looks especially good in that place

1239
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,800
This is the same lenticular cloud

1240
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,200
it has several layers

1241
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,600
It's the same kind of fluctuation not just one layer

1242
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,800
sometimes several layers

1243
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,000
Sometimes it looks very, very spectacular

1244
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,800
This will just go here and look up

1245
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,600
This is actually very, very many

1246
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,600
Very, very beautiful clouds can be seen

1247
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,800
And I just talked for a long time

1248
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,600
No weather

1249
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,800
So if there is no wind

1250
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,000
Clouds will still come

1251
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,400
so the wind blows

1252
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,600
This is just a general statement

1253
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,800
It's okay without the wind

1254
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,600
that's the other way around now

1255
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,000
If there is wind, do the clouds have to move?

1256
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
After each use, after psychology is disassembled, we may or may not move

1257
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,500
It does not move sometimes, why? You can watch this video

1258
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
The wind is clearly blowing

1259
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
But some power supplies don't seem to want to run away

1260
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Like this teacher here on this mountain

1261
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
One side is bigger and the other side is small, but it seems that he is not willing to run away

1262
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
isn't it a bit strange

1263
00:58:35,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So if there is no wind blowing, will the cloud not move? Is it possible to not move?

1264
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
like this case

1265
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,440
The wind is clearly leaving, the wind is blowing

1266
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,720
But that means I don't want to run away

1267
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,600
is it possible

1268
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,080
But that's what the movie is about

1269
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,680
Actually what's going on

1270
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,160
This is also a wave shadow

1271
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,080
How does this wave shadow come about?

1272
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,800
Because when the wind blows over the mountain, there are many waves

1273
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,080
so where the wind blows

1274
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,280
cloud is born

1275
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,560
because the air is reborn

1276
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,320
Just when this wave is generated

1277
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,920
This wave is called Standing Wave.

1278
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,040
when it blows over this mountain

1279
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,960
The wind of that wave is always in the same place

1280
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:41,800
So every time this moisture-laden air

1281
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,800
As soon as it blows over this mountain

1282
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,200
in the same place

1283
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,080
it also produces a wind

1284
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,360
where is a wave of wind

1285
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,240
So the air goes up in that same place

1286
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,840
after this wind

1287
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,560
Air rises down in the same place

1288
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,280
Once it goes down, it rises into the clouds and disappears.

1289
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,640
Once it goes up the cloud appears

1290
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,360
So in fact that cloud is not the original cloud

1291
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,860
That cloud is different from that water vapor

1292
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:08,860
If you make a mark for each of the water vapor, say

1293
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:10,860
This water vapor is fake and this is mobile

1294
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:14,060
I don't know where the water vapor in that Chiayi bottle went.

1295
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:17,060
But it looks like you're talking about the same cloud

1296
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,060
that's just an illusion

1297
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:22,060
In fact, all clouds are illusions

1298
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:28,060
When talking about age, everyone is actually an illusion

1299
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,060
So in biologists say

1300
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:33,060
Our cells seem to be replaced every seven years.

1301
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:37,060
So every seven years I am actually a different person

1302
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:41,060
So I used to say that the American one

1303
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:43,060
A swap called that Simpson

1304
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:47,060
Oggy Simpson he all scrubs his wife

1305
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,060
if in case he is convicted

1306
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:52,060
He can be hidden for seven years and then run out

1307
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,060
say I'm different

1308
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,060
I'm not the original one

1309
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:59,060
At critical times, I can say that what I want to judge is not

1310
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,060
not your body

1311
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
It's who you are, who you are as Oggy Simpson

1312
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:10,000
But the cloud really isn't it's not a solid thing

1313
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
So the components inside him are actually changing all the time.

1314
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
The cloud you'll see isn't really a constant thing

1315
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
The thing itself is always changing

1316
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
What you see doesn't change is the shape of that thing

1317
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
just a pattern, a form

1318
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
You always think that thing, this cloud is not

1319
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
That's just the form of that cloud

1320
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
So this thing is a very important point to understand the movement of clouds

1321
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,000
So the following pattern is also such a phenomenon

1322
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
The water vapor has already been

1323
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
You can see that the cloud doesn't seem to go anywhere else.

1324
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
It's just been moving up and down, but it's not

1325
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
That cloud has already gone away

1326
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I don't know where the water went

1327
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
What you see is actually a completely different cloud

1328
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
That water vapor is already new water vapor

1329
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,600
For the same reason, when you watch the sign reports on TV, you can see

1330
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,160
Where does a certain typhoon come from?

1331
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:11,000
A huge cloud, like a whirlpool, and move here

1332
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,840
That's just the form of the vortex running

1333
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,660
I don't know where the water went

1334
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,460
Those waters have already finished raining

1335
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,760
There is new water coming out

1336
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,060
It's just that the water runs into the same whirlpool all day long

1337
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:25,340
so it looks like

1338
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,140
The clouds seem to have the same shape

1339
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,980
In fact, the water in those clouds has already been replaced with a lot of new ones.

1340
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,520
completely different

1341
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,800
so the point is

1342
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:38,400
One of the things you need to know when looking at the cloud

1343
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,240
OK, just now we mentioned that the vertical movement is mainly related to the generation of clouds

1344
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,060
Then let's say the level will not

1345
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:47,100
Did you guess wrong about the level?

1346
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,660
because there is no change in air pressure

1347
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:52,220
So the possibility of creating a cloud

1348
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:54,540
doesn't seem too big

1349
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:58,020
Is there any objection to this

1350
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:59,860
Is there any objection? No one seems to object. Strange

1351
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,600
Everyone agrees very much today

1352
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,400
In fact, a horizontal pass can also cause clouds

1353
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,600
have you seen this

1354
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,800
If you go to the show of this plane

1355
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,200
Panel sometimes sees that the aircraft performance is very slow

1356
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,400
when suddenly it's fast

1357
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:25,400
Suddenly, as soon as I dodged and won, I was captured in a certain place on the plane

1358
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,000
This is a positive wave

1359
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,600
Why is it called Zhengbo

1360
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:34,600
Because it's generated in exactly the same place as the so-called positive wave wind

1361
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,200
Sharkfron

1362
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,600
It is exactly the same shape as its positive wave

1363
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,000
and this place is

1364
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,600
When an aircraft accelerates to just supersonic speed

1365
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,800
That's when this cloud was born

1366
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,200
this is weird

1367
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,800
How did this cloud come about

1368
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,400
The two elements of the cloud we just talked about

1369
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,000
one is water vapor

1370
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,800
one is saturated

1371
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,400
so you have a way to saturate it

1372
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,520
In fact, both horizontal and vertical

1373
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,520
it doesn't matter

1374
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,480
So this horizontal movement

1375
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,880
How can it be saturated?

1376
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:11,520
When an aircraft accelerates beyond the factor

1377
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,040
For a while because of the movement of the plane itself

1378
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,480
faster than its rising wave

1379
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,560
the one with its air

1380
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:22,000
The air originally had a rising wave, the so-called compression wave

1381
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,200
when you generate this

1382
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,400
your wave source

1383
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,000
When the speed of this wave is faster than yours

1384
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,480
the wave generated at that time

1385
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,880
That's no ordinary rising wave

1386
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,040
that's a positive wave

1387
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:35,480
That positive wave causes the air to expand dramatically

1388
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,760
Usually the rising wave and the expansion are very small

1389
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,160
But this positive wave suddenly

1390
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,920
In a very short time it swells very much

1391
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,480
As long as the air expands

1392
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:46,880
right away

1393
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,920
Rapid expansion produces rapid cooling

1394
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,400
If you were this

1395
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,080
If the moisture content is sufficient

1396
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,040
so rapidly expanding

1397
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,600
let it happen now

1398
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,960
big ticket cloud

1399
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,220
His shape is exactly the same as the shape of the positive wave

1400
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:06,200
So this quantity is the so-called positive wave

1401
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:14,000
So he this if he keeps going at this supersonic speed

1402
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,720
That Yun Changchang has been following him

1403
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:19,600
Because he looked like he hung up a pilot

1404
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,160
It's like running for a long time

1405
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,720
Sometimes you fly over that drier place

1406
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:24,880
the cloud disappears

1407
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,280
The certifier is about to emerge

1408
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,240
you say watch that kind of movie

1409
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,160
And he sometimes does not practice local

1410
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,680
Sometimes there are two different places

1411
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:36,440
As long as that place exceeded the speed of sound at that time

1412
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,960
you will see this cloud

1413
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:41,160
So the same positive wave cloud

1414
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,600
so this is horizontal movement

1415
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,440
accounting is fair

1416
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,920
Is there anything other than this word?

1417
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,760
This positive wave supersonic

1418
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,480
Is there anyone climbing here?

1419
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,480
does anyone like mountain climbing

1420
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Has anyone seen this cloud before?

1421
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
In fact, Yushan sometimes has this kind of cloud

1422
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
This is Benechal and this is Qi Yun

1423
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
because it will be like a Qizi

1424
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Usually this cloud is where it's downwind

1425
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Especially an isolated mountain like this

1426
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
particularly likely

1427
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
As long as this mountain is not too long

1428
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
like a ridge

1429
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
as long as it is relatively isolated

1430
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
and there are no other mountains nearby

1431
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
block until it has a high probability of producing this cloud

1432
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
like the world's tallest everest

1433
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Also often have this kind of Benechal

1434
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
generate this cloud

1435
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
If you are climbing

1436
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
you see this cloud

1437
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
you plan not to go up

1438
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
better

1439
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
why

1440
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
because when you see this cloud

1441
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
it means the weather is not going to be good

1442
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
at least the wind will be strong

1443
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
so you were climbing

1444
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
can be quite dangerous

1445
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
especially the mountain

1446
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
That mountain wind is so strong

1447
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
but how did it come about

1448
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,560
Because usually you want enough wind speed

1449
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:05,880
windy enough

1450
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,800
Of course there is enough water

1451
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,360
when the wind is strong enough

1452
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,680
when you blow through a main obstacle

1453
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,760
in front of the obstacle

1454
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,720
it is a high pressure area

1455
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,960
But behind this obstacle

1456
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,200
is a low pressure area

1457
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,320
So of course when an air goes from high pressure to low pressure

1458
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,160
it also swells

1459
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,760
it would have been denser

1460
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,640
Once in this low pressure area it has no limit

1461
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,400
as the air rises

1462
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,040
At this time, the air will also expand

1463
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:33,840
when the air expands

1464
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,480
it will cool down

1465
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,440
possible after cooling

1466
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,880
saturate the water with air

1467
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,680
So you have this cloud

1468
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,880
Of course there are one or two other causes of cloud formation

1469
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,480
But the most important cause

1470
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,600
It's because of the wind inside

1471
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,040
so why do you see clouds

1472
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,760
Almost every time

1473
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,320
just behind this mountain

1474
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,320
just one

1475
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:59,080
like a cloud floating in the ocean

1476
01:07:59,080 --> 01:07:59,960
the reason for it

1477
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
That's it

1478
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
so this is another

1479
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Similarly, Ma Dehong in Switzerland is particularly easy to produce

1480
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Because he is a particularly isolated mountain

1481
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
So he often has a big flag

1482
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
hanging on his flagpole

1483
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
it will

1484
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
So while horizontal motion is not the most important cause of clouds

1485
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
But he can also generate clouds

1486
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Just gave two examples

1487
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
OK

1488
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
So we conclude that the shape of the cloud is mainly due to the flow of air

1489
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Clouds are formed in the air

1490
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
If the air flow pattern does not change

1491
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
The shape of the cloud will not change

1492
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
look at those wave shadows

1493
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
it stays that way

1494
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Why? Because the shape of the air flow will not change

1495
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
And if the air flows in the wrong way

1496
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
and not moving

1497
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Instant air is moving

1498
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
the cloud doesn't move

1499
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Because the cloud is in this form only

1500
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
The cloud of the cloud actually represents the kind of

1501
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
a pattern

1502
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,240
So the wind blows that cloud whatever you want

1503
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,600
It's not moving at all

1504
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:10,100
This is the most important point of watching the movement of clouds

1505
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:15,400
OK, come on down, we usually say that clouds condense when they reach saturation.

1506
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:20,280
Right or wrong because common sense doesn't seem to be wrong

1507
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,640
But seriously, it's not quite right.

1508
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,480
Because the so-called so-called saturation is 100%

1509
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,480
Relatively moderate and you can reach saturation

1510
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,200
The so-called relative moderate is under a specific temperature and pressure

1511
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,880
Ratio of current steam to saturated steam

1512
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,600
that is called relative moderation

1513
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:46,320
Saturated steam is generally determined by temperature

1514
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,520
under a certain temperature

1515
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:53,080
This steam that needs to be balanced on your level

1516
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,560
That is called saturated steam

1517
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,720
British scientist Teklin Kelvin

1518
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,080
he proposes a

1519
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
He proves to you that when your relative numbers are hundreds of words

1520
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I will give you a drop of water, I promise that the drop of water must be multiplied

1521
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
And it must be multiplied until all of them disappear, do you want to believe it or not

1522
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
We usually say that I don't believe it, we have already said in textbooks

1523
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Humidity is 100 words, it is starting to be lingering, but CAMMAN says it is wrong

1524
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Humidity, the water droplet should be increased, I didn't believe it at the beginning

1525
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
But when you go to the partner company, it seems that you don't have a big face

1526
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Later, many people did a lot of experiments, and it is indeed the case

1527
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Indeed, it is indeed multiplied, and I later found out that our ordinary water droplets

1528
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
That's a few different kinds of water droplets, our normal water droplets

1529
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
It's not clean enough at all, if the water droplet is clean

1530
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
The water droplet of your relative number of hundreds of characters will increase and dissolve

1531
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
This has been proved by many experiments

1532
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Then under what circumstances that water drop

1533
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
won't multiply

1534
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
The water drops will get off, there must be something else

1535
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,800
not just water

1536
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,500
Many experiments have proved that

1537
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,500
just below our surface environment

1538
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,600
if you only have water vapor

1539
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,900
nothing else the air will stick

1540
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,100
you smoked it very clean

1541
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:17,200
Use a filter to get it very clean

1542
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,100
Are you probably 300% or 400% relatively

1543
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,100
you will have to condense out

1544
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,100
Otherwise there would be no condensation

1545
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,600
Usually our air is not so clean

1546
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,700
There's a lot of stuff in there

1547
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:29,900
a bunch of these little particles

1548
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,600
That kind of small particle is the so-called condensation here

1549
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,200
Usually you need the help of these little particles

1550
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,700
Water vapor can only be used when the relative number is 100%.

1551
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:40,800
just started to condense

1552
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,900
Otherwise it would be so-called oversatisfaction

1553
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,900
it will go all the way to 300 400

1554
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:48,100
Then it starts to condense into water

1555
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,800
So this is called condensation

1556
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,500
So it's important to say

1557
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:56,000
Clouds will form in our air

1558
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,100
almost certain to have this condensation

1559
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:59,400
Otherwise there would be no clouds

1560
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,380
Very clean air and probably no clouds

1561
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,400
So it must be clean without air

1562
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,840
There must be some fine dust in the air

1563
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:14,920
Some dust particles create this cloud

1564
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,400
So this thing is called condensation nuclei

1565
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,240
The most common condensation nuclei are

1566
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,720
Leuphane-Anderlein

1567
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,480
This Sodium Ammonium Sulphate

1568
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:27,840
And the usual severity

1569
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,840
Ordinary is less severe

1570
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,800
Most of this flow cream

1571
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,440
if the cloud continues to grow

1572
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:42,440
will turn into rain

1573
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,520
become raindrops

1574
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:48,040
I used Google to find some cartoonists

1575
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:49,880
raindrops have any opinion

1576
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,200
Which one of the raindrops do you think is the best?

1577
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,320
or which one is the worst

1578
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,720
In fact, they all look the same

1579
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,200
He must have painted them all the same.

1580
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,000
But the most important point is that the raindrops here are all drawn wrong

1581
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
raindrops don't look like that

1582
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
this is not a raindrop

1583
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
this is tears

1584
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
This is a teardrop

1585
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Raindrops are not like this

1586
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Apparently these cartoonists have never seen raindrops like this

1587
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
what raindrops look like

1588
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
The raindrops are actually quite steep

1589
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
You said to use that kind of quick photo

1590
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
When it rains, take pictures of the raindrops

1591
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
This is an example

1592
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Below the raindrops is flat

1593
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
almost flat

1594
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
sometimes farther

1595
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
But most of them are cheaper

1596
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
farther up

1597
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
This is the image of real raindrops and this is what it looks like

1598
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
You see, none of the cartoonists came out with a drawing board

1599
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
But if you know slip mechanics

1600
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
That's the only thing that's reasonable

1601
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
That's exactly what it looks like

1602
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Indeed the image of raindrops

1603
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,600
It's exactly the shape of this barbarian head

1604
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:06,300
And here's one that we're doing experiments in a wind tunnel

1605
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:10,720
You can put a bead of water in a vertical wind tunnel

1606
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,860
there's wind blowing up below

1607
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:16,900
You can use this as long as the technology and equipment are in high condition

1608
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,460
You can stop this droplet in the air

1609
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,900
let it stop there

1610
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:23,060
Even in front of your eyes you can watch it stew for two hours

1611
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,060
if you want

1612
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:28,500
We did this kind of experiment before I was at this time

1613
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:40,160
This one is 1 to 3mm

1614
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:41,960
and no power plant

1615
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,300
In addition, there are cases for power plants

1616
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,600
But today I won't have the chance to tell you

1617
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:52,960
This drop of water floating in the air

1618
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:56,900
Do you see if its shape is that of a brute?

1619
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,160
blow up

1620
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,240
The same is equivalent to this raindrop

1621
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,360
like falling from above

1622
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,640
then i make it stop there

1623
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,840
adjust from time to time

1624
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:14,440
speed of air

1625
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,040
Because the water droplets will gradually increase in size after a long time.

1626
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,520
so it gets smaller

1627
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,160
So its speed will change

1628
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:35,240
This one is through a glass pie

1629
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:58,420
Then I want to raise the stage here

1630
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:00,080
I'll mention it here

1631
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
mentioned water of course, but rain if it's high enough

1632
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,000
There is not only water in it, of course there is also ice, that is what will be mentioned below

1633
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:14,000
So that's the water drop that's all in the air in october four

1634
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
So I hope everyone will go back after watching this today

1635
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
The next time it rains, you have to think about it all over your head, that's right

1636
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:38,000
OK, so when the temperature in that cloud drops below zero degrees Celsius

1637
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Water vapor and water droplets in clouds may start to freeze into ice

1638
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Water droplets may freeze into ice, but if water vapor freezes directly

1639
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
That is a freezing phenomenon called sublimation

1640
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,000
This is just common sense, common sense is often not the truth

1641
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
When observing in the clouds

1642
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,280
The temperature of its clouds is often minus 20 degrees

1643
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,160
As a result, the water is still low

1644
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,960
The water inside is still low, and it still hasn't turned into ice

1645
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,920
That water is too cold

1646
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:14,120
That supercooled water is often very, very common.

1647
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,320
So what we often observe below zero is to say

1648
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,960
minus ten to twenty degrees

1649
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,280
Sometimes even to minus 40 degrees

1650
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,960
it will really turn into ice

1651
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:24,560
Otherwise it is often still a lot of water

1652
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,280
and it's bad to say

1653
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,320
you know it's water

1654
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,000
But once your plane flies over

1655
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,760
it may turn to ice in no time

1656
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:33,720
and as soon as it flies past

1657
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:38,280
It's the water that sticks to the wings of your plane

1658
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,520
and can't get rid of

1659
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,440
And once the cloud is thick enough,

1660
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,360
you keep flying

1661
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,000
Its ice is getting thicker

1662
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,520
In the end, the shape of your wings completely changed

1663
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,280
It's that changed shape, that plane

1664
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,800
won't get up at all

1665
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,480
Because the wings of an airplane must have a certain shape

1666
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,960
it can go up

1667
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,680
When your airplane wings are covered with ice like this

1668
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,000
you'll come down again

1669
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,940
Many plane crashes are due to the phenomenon of aircraft crews

1670
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,540
The machine is on the paper list

1671
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:10,440
The most serious machine soldier does not mean that the soldier is directly glued to it

1672
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,200
but this supercooled water

1673
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,840
super cold water

1674
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,640
But once he touches this solid surface

1675
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,500
He immediately formed an army

1676
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,100
and can't take it off

1677
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,000
he's so clingy

1678
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,940
that is the most dangerous situation

1679
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:26,440
so under what circumstances

1680
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,940
he will form an army

1681
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:29,900
same as coagulation

1682
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:32,540
He wants another thing called a soldier box

1683
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:35,140
He can do it only if he gets a soldier

1684
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,540
He needs a soldier box before he can form a soldier

1685
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:48,540
The so-called ordinary weapon box often processes ordinary things

1686
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:49,940
just ordinary sand

1687
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:51,340
just ordinary dust

1688
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:54,440
So you think that this thing should be all over the sky

1689
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,040
not all over the sky

1690
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:58,140
Ordinary sand is actually big

1691
01:18:58,140 --> 01:18:59,640
Ordinary sand means maybe

1692
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
fraction of a millimeter

1693
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,760
You gotta get this thing up that high

1694
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:06,760
it is not going up

1695
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,760
so be slow

1696
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,560
So the high altitude is actually

1697
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,060
The sky is clean

1698
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:14,860
so you have these things that condense into ice

1699
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:16,360
In fact, it is full

1700
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,860
But once it freezes

1701
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:19,360
it's quite beautiful

1702
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:22,860
You can see many different

1703
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:25,360
snowflake shape

1704
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,360
Here is an example for you

1705
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Snowflakes usually mentioned in camp

1706
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Many ice spirits collide

1707
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
it combines with each other

1708
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
become the so-called Goose Feather University

1709
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Have you seen Goose Feather University

1710
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
It's not actually a piece of ice

1711
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
several different pieces of ice

1712
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
even hundreds of pieces of different years up

1713
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
That is the so-called Goose Feather University

1714
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
something like this

1715
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
this piece

1716
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
In fact, there are probably dozens of different

1717
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
The little ice spirits are all connected together

1718
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
caused

1719
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
In addition to this ice aid, of course there are also ice explosions

1720
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
bigger stuff

1721
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
This thing is more dangerous

1722
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
When the ice burst is relatively small

1723
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
We have this called a soft burst

1724
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
called Blobber

1725
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Soft bursts usually occur in very specific shapes

1726
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
A bit like our Lianwu

1727
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
But it's very small

1728
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Little Lianwu

1729
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
The ice bursts are of course big and small

1730
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
This is 2006

1731
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Some ice blasts in front of my back yard

1732
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
so if you don't know

1733
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
what kind of steamed stuffed bun is there

1734
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
pearl balls or something

1735
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
no

1736
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
This is an ice blast

1737
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
That time the parcel company lost money

1738
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Lost us 20,000 yuan

1739
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
fix the roof

1740
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Because the ice burst

1741
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Is the roof not pierced?

1742
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
But there are a lot of cold spots

1743
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
So that time it seemed like this

1744
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
The parcel company over there lost money

1745
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
throughout the region

1746
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
the one in the area

1747
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
The parcel company will pay for it

1748
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:19,000
This is the largest ice storm in the world record in 2010, 0.88 kilograms and 20 centimeters in diameter

1749
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,000
It's better not to go out in this weather

1750
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:31,000
So the clouds represent the possibility of a large ice storm.

1751
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Under what circumstances will an ice storm occur?

1752
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
This is all based on such a big

1753
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
What conditions do you need to generate such a large ice storm?

1754
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Must have that ascender has very strong

1755
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Because if the ascender is not strong enough

1756
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
That thing condensed a little bit and fell off.

1757
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
So it has to be so strong that it goes all the way up

1758
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Then collide with others, grow bigger and longer

1759
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
up to or even higher than that too high for an ice storm

1760
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,200
The typhoon is even faster

1761
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,400
when it goes up all the way up to

1762
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,600
About 60 to 70 meters per second

1763
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,600
so fast ascent

1764
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,000
to produce such a large ice storm

1765
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Then once your ascending current is not enough to support it

1766
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
it just started to fall

1767
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
So when you see such a big ice storm

1768
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,800
This represents the original

1769
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,000
the speed is very very high

1770
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,200
So a whole bunch of this process

1771
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,200
how do we study it

1772
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,000
Of course, the most direct way is to

1773
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Will go to the operator to observe

1774
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
But I will go to the operator to observe it.

1775
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
The first consumption will be very large

1776
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
The second is very dangerous

1777
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Generally speaking

1778
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
real worst area

1779
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Most likely, they just dare not go in.

1780
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
dare not drive in

1781
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Some people go in by accident

1782
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
If you accidentally go in, it's a serious situation.

1783
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
lots of fighting chances to go in

1784
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
will be beaten by ice

1785
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
There's something wrong with the windows too

1786
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
The shape of the wings has also changed

1787
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
a lot of boil

1788
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,500
We generally have another method theory

1789
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:05,160
all the physical processes we know

1790
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,000
represented by mathematical formulas

1791
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,500
This is called a mathematical formula

1792
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,000
The obtained partial text is represented by replacing it with

1793
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Then formulate its initial boundary conditions

1794
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,500
Use a computer to find a set of solutions

1795
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,000
Then answer these

1796
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Draw it with the method of computer drawing

1797
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
I can come and explain what the process is like

1798
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,000
If compared with the actual observation

1799
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
if it's good

1800
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
We can take this cloud model

1801
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,000
The help produced is a research tool

1802
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
can come to study

1803
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,000
The formation of a cloud is roughly like its internal structure

1804
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
So this is one of our institutes

1805
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Made a cloud model like this

1806
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
make a cloud make a base cloud

1807
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Its pattern basically at least looks like

1808
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Kiyun starts from the ground

1809
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,640
grow to protrude a little

1810
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:06,740
And then as soon as you get to this really long, real inflammation

1811
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:08,240
in this flat city

1812
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:12,240
Produced at the top of this convective city

1813
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:15,740
So this is an example of a fish pattern

1814
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:17,440
you can see this

1815
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:20,940
Indeed compared with the real observation

1816
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:22,740
It is indeed full of images

1817
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,840
So this once this after

1818
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:29,640
We can put all kinds of different fish inside the fish

1819
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:33,640
ice burst cloud low ice crystals

1820
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:36,640
Draw different windcloths

1821
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:37,980
and then animate it too

1822
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:40,480
You can know where the ice burst and where

1823
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:45,180
It can be predicted that

1824
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:47,480
The blue above is all ice

1825
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,980
The red part, the ice burst part

1826
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:53,480
The green part represents the part where it rains

1827
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:54,640
at this time

1828
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:57,640
We use it as a research tool

1829
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,640
It's still very useful

1830
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,620
And if you want that kind of thing, you can study it.

1831
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:07,220
how big is the flood

1832
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:10,220
How much rain can you have with one fortune

1833
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:11,520
Do you want to guess

1834
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,420
How much rain can an ordinary lucky flower bring

1835
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:16,420
How many tons can be dropped

1836
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:18,420
do you want to guess

1837
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:22,520
10,000 tons seems to be asking for a price

1838
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,520
100,000 tons, 1,000,000 tons

1839
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:29,220
almost one million tons

1840
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:32,220
even millions of tons

1841
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:34,220
a simple luck

1842
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:36,220
so much water can come out

1843
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:39,220
Anyway very very strong

1844
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:41,220
Speaking of the flood means

1845
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:43,220
I just talked about a multiple choice question

1846
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:47,220
Everyone, be brave and choose

1847
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:50,220
Which flood was the largest ever to occur on earth

1848
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:54,220
One is the time when Datong water was in the age of shaking

1849
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:56,220
The second is Deep Gold as mentioned above

1850
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:58,220
Noah's Ark

1851
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:00,220
The so-called Great Ark of Animal Rescue conveys

1852
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,720
That time, it might have been Typhoon Morakot.

1853
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,400
i bring soda with this

1854
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,000
you probably don't know

1855
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Your older self remembers having this big bottle of soda in this

1856
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
The fifth answer is to fly above the knot

1857
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
we have some experts here

1858
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,000
The real biggest flood is not long after the formation of the ninth hill

1859
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
That time was really the biggest

1860
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
because why

1861
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Now the flood is once

1862
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
For example, if you are given tens of millions of tons of water

1863
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
but what was that time

1864
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
That rain caused the entire ocean

1865
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
You don't have that much water now

1866
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Not so much water now

1867
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Because when our earth first started

1868
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
There was no water for a while

1869
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Later, a lot of water vapor is slowly released from the earth's crust.

1870
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Then it starts to create a lot of geo

1871
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,540
So it's not the same as silver now

1872
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:02,880
Silver must have been dazzling back then

1873
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,600
full of dark clouds

1874
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,400
water vapor everywhere

1875
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,200
hot everywhere

1876
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:09,480
volcanoes everywhere

1877
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,520
that steam comes out

1878
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:14,080
not ordinary so-called silver

1879
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,620
that was a volcanic eruption

1880
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:16,900
volcanic eruptions

1881
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,680
Even in the current volcanic eruption

1882
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:19,720
largest part

1883
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,760
The released gas is still water vapor

1884
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,300
mostly water vapor

1885
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:25,860
Second is carbon dioxide

1886
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:26,880
sulfur dioxide

1887
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,680
and then finally

1888
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,220
it's bomb now

1889
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:33,020
So I was still an old demon at the time.

1890
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:36,100
The most common gas is this

1891
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:38,160
For a while, the earth actually had many of these

1892
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:40,460
But because of the environment of the earth

1893
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:41,480
a little cold

1894
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:43,520
So the water will become clean soon

1895
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,360
So this kind of process has been going through I don't know how long

1896
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:51,720
Finally, all the excess water and air in it are all in the early morning water.

1897
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:53,760
really biggest biggest flood

1898
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:57,360
This is how the world's oceans are now created

1899
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,620
this is what is called

1900
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,820
The biggest flood ever happened, so you guessed it

1901
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:06,400
Of course he doesn't know that he can't guess

1902
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:13,060
Ok, what impact does the cloud have on the overall environment?

1903
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,180
I'm not saying that the cloud is only good-looking over there.

1904
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:21,760
There must be some effect on the entire atmospheric environment

1905
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,060
What is his role like?

1906
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:26,120
The first everyone knows this so-called

1907
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:28,420
A star fish is not a fish, it nourishes all things

1908
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:29,180
this

1909
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:33,020
The squid place is of course on the ground

1910
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,080
crops are fine

1911
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:36,360
no if not

1912
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:38,140
this is that

1913
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,940
NASA this Modus

1914
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,760
made this surface color

1915
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,300
real color

1916
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:46,080
Overview of

1917
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:47,360
you can tell by saying

1918
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:48,900
some places

1919
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:49,920
high humidity

1920
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:51,460
looks green

1921
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:53,760
The surface has some straight backs

1922
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:59,900
where the color looks dry and cool of course

1923
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,700
It's just sprinkled in the desert

1924
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,900
Like a salad in the west of China

1925
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,500
and central australia

1926
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,900
It's all desert

1927
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:13,600
So this role needs to be adjusted

1928
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,300
What is the second fish for?

1929
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:18,700
Is the most efficient cleaner of the atmosphere

1930
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:20,900
inside our atmosphere

1931
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:23,100
If there is no such process of rain

1932
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:26,400
Our pollution has been accumulating and accumulating

1933
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,700
just stop

1934
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,500
it won't be cleared

1935
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:33,800
that clearing effect

1936
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:36,500
The strongest effect is this rain

1937
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:40,300
This is the mechanism of heavy rain and rain

1938
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:41,900
The mechanism of Shen Yuyu is the biggest

1939
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,800
the most efficient

1940
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,300
It is the so-called sinking rain effect

1941
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:48,000
Didn't we just talk about Ling Jiehe?

1942
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,900
You only need a Lingjiehe

1943
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,500
It is possible to absorb this moisture

1944
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:54,500
Then a cloud or raindrop is formed

1945
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:57,500
As long as you are in the rainy process

1946
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:00,000
Then your thing and the river

1947
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,200
Even in this rain everything falls to the ground

1948
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,600
so the air is clean

1949
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,900
so why after it rains

1950
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,600
The air seems to be cleaner

1951
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:09,600
Or the air looks cleaner after it snows

1952
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:14,200
It is because of this process of rain

1953
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:17,800
Sweep away these polluting things in the air

1954
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,800
This is an experiment done by others

1955
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:24,500
The representative said that after it snows

1956
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:27,600
Indeed, I saw a circle around the snow

1957
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,200
This sweat, this dirt

1958
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,200
was brought down by this snow

1959
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:34,400
it means

1960
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:38,400
it does have a good cleaning effect

1961
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,800
There is another very expensive thing over here

1962
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,400
This thing is called Gridfield Gap

1963
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,000
snow or rain

1964
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,200
When the particle is very small

1965
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,600
it clears well

1966
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,900
It clears well when the particles are large

1967
01:30:56,900 --> 01:31:00,100
But when the particle is between 0.1 and 1 as the surface

1968
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,000
It can hardly be cleared, and it can be cleared very little

1969
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,000
So there's always these 0.1 to 1 millimeters in the air

1970
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
A thing of this great concentration

1971
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,000
That thing is almost impossible to clear

1972
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
That seems like how you wash it those particles

1973
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
always in the air

1974
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
there's a physical reason for that

1975
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
we used to do

1976
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
A calculation model we made

1977
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
calculated result

1978
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
That's exactly what it looks like

1979
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
The middle one is called Griffel Gammel

1980
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
This guy Griffel when he first brought it up

1981
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
there is such a possibility

1982
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Then we have confirmed that this phenomenon does exist.

1983
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
ok

1984
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
So this third character is

1985
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Clouds affect the Earth's ambient light

1986
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
The so-called ambient light ratio is Albido

1987
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
that of course means

1988
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
If you look at something in space

1989
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
how bright

1990
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
In fact, if that thing doesn't light up by itself

1991
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,600
It's the kind that inverts the color of other light sources

1992
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,600
That brightness is the so-called slowing force

1993
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,100
So the greater the retardation

1994
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:11,100
Indicates that those things may be brighter

1995
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:12,800
In terms of the celestial body

1996
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:13,800
inside our celestial body

1997
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:16,300
The brightest in the sky are of course the sun and the moon

1998
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:17,400
The two largest

1999
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,100
Of course the sun brightens itself

2000
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:20,700
Of course the moon is illuminated by the sun

2001
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:22,700
besides these two

2002
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:24,600
Which is the brightest celestial body

2003
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,200
Venus

2004
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,700
Venus

2005
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:30,200
Venus

2006
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,200
Has anyone voted for Mars?

2007
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:34,700
No

2008
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:35,400
strangeness

2009
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,100
all Venus fans

2010
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:38,200
But it is true

2011
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,700
Venus is nothing but the sun and the moon

2012
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:41,800
third

2013
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,200
third two

2014
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:45,700
is auric

2015
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:48,700
why is venus so bright

2016
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:49,700
these two reasons

2017
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:51,700
because it's close

2018
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:52,900
because it's close

2019
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,400
first because it's close

2020
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,400
it's closer to us

2021
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,100
so this is the first reason

2022
01:32:57,100 --> 01:33:00,000
The first reason is because it is surrounded by a very dense cloud

2023
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,000
What about his clouds, unlike our place where there are no clouds?

2024
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
He surrounded all the ninety or so secret clouds

2025
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
But his cloud is a bad cloud

2026
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,000
His clouds are all acid, all are clouds of acid

2027
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:22,000
So this is bad because Jingxing is called Vinus on the Western side

2028
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Weiner is a very cute girl

2029
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
But in fact, Jingxing is a very bad place

2030
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
His clouds are all acid, all clouds of acid

2031
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
His ground is more than 400 degrees

2032
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
That's terrible. He's just hot medicine.

2033
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,000
As soon as all the water gets there, it doesn’t just boil, it literally melts away.

2034
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,000
His pressure is more than ninety times that of the earth's surface

2035
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
So if you're not protected, you can't breathe at all.

2036
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:56,000
It's as if you are shallow in this sea, about 2,000 meters under pressure

2037
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
So much pressure, this is Jingxing's surface

2038
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,680
Bi Xing looks so bright, but there is nothing to envy

2039
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:07,480
That's because it was blown out whole by a secret cloud

2040
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:11,640
So it reflects this sunlight very, very strongly

2041
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:15,080
It looks very bright in the night sky

2042
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:17,080
Earth is not so much

2043
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:19,480
Earth's albedo is not as strong

2044
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:23,840
So the blue part of the earth basically sees the sea surface

2045
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:28,320
The surface of the sea is very dark if you look directly at it.

2046
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:30,800
What is the reason for the reflection of the earth?

2047
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,560
Mostly because the cloud doesn't matter

2048
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,880
cloud it is very white

2049
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,560
So when the sun shines on it, it reflects back

2050
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:40,600
The Earth includes clouds including floor albedo

2051
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,840
The reflection band is about 30%

2052
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:45,000
So the albedo is 0.3%

2053
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:49,160
This is our common sense of the earth's albedo

2054
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:52,880
If cloud cover on Earth increases

2055
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,320
The albedo of the earth will increase

2056
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,480
Because there are more clouds

2057
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,520
When there are more clouds, its albedo will increase

2058
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:59,760
if you were an alien

2059
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,300
Because the earth is a little suddenly bright

2060
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:06,100
The biggest possible reason is that the earth's clouds suddenly increased

2061
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:09,000
then say your next question

2062
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,200
Why do Earth's clouds increase?

2063
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,000
he started researching

2064
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
There are of course various reasons for this

2065
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
next one

2066
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
What is the most important greenhouse atmosphere on Earth

2067
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
If you don't know a little bit, it will change

2068
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
right

2069
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
The most important thing is actually water vapor

2070
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Water vapor is the largest greenhouse atmosphere on Earth

2071
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,000
The so-called Hu-color equilibrium temperature on the earth is about minus 21 degrees

2072
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
very cold

2073
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
The earth is supposed to be cold

2074
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
But the earth is not that cold

2075
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Why

2076
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Because the earth's surface releases some water vapor

2077
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
This water vapor surrounds our planet

2078
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
making the earth's surface

2079
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
So increasing the temperature

2080
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
The average temperature of our earth is about 15 degrees

2081
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,000
So from minus 21 degrees to 15 degrees

2082
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Added 36 degrees

2083
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
80 to 90 credits for this concentration

2084
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
It's all crystal

2085
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
not carbon dioxide

2086
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Then you must feel very strange

2087
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Otherwise, now everyone is teaching carbon dioxide what is the truth

2088
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Because everyone thinks that crystal aura is a state of balance

2089
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
When there is more crystal gas, it will become a cloud

2090
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
So go back to the state of crystal air

2091
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
it just keeps looping

2092
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
So has the crystal energy increased?

2093
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
we do not know

2094
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Let's say it's balanced

2095
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
But the carbon dioxide cools down

2096
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
just keep going up

2097
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
so it's obvious

2098
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
It must have this warming effect

2099
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
That's why we now put carbon dioxide

2100
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Considered an important greenhouse base

2101
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
But if you talk about the real magnitude

2102
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Carbon dioxide is not

2103
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
really the biggest thing

2104
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
crystal air

2105
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,340
In addition to water vapor, clouds actually have a great stabilizing effect

2106
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:08,500
It's just that clouds are difficult to measure, which is a bit of a headache

2107
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:15,700
OK, so this cloud has a lot of problems

2108
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,300
Are clouds stabilizing or cooling?

2109
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,700
Clouds, as we just talked about, are major contributors to the Earth's albedo

2110
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,700
So if it's cloudy, it reflects the light back

2111
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:28,700
light is reflected much more of course

2112
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:30,700
This means that less energy from the sun passes through

2113
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:36,200
So in terms of its role, it should cool the ground

2114
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:39,700
But if the ground radiation goes up,

2115
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:42,700
The cloud will absorb him and then reflect it back to him

2116
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:46,200
So in terms of that role, it also has a stabilizing effect

2117
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,200
so this is bad, what to do

2118
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:54,200
To make matters worse, low clouds are not the same as high clouds

2119
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:58,700
low cloud, it is now common opinion to say

2120
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,200
low cloud it is mostly

2121
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,500
Has a warming and cooling effect

2122
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:06,000
Its main function is to slow down the sunlight

2123
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,500
It does not have much heat dissipation in this brook

2124
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:12,000
no effect

2125
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
But high clouds like cirrus clouds

2126
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,500
Just saw those cirrus clouds

2127
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,500
It does have the effect of steaming and warming

2128
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,000
If there are many cirrus clouds

2129
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
it may creek a lot hotter

2130
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,500
before spreading it back

2131
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,000
it dissipates heat by itself

2132
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,500
But its heat dissipation is the so-called black body radiation

2133
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:29,500
It radiates from a black body because its temperature itself is very cold

2134
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,500
So it dissipates very little heat

2135
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:33,500
So it's generally

2136
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,500
It has more effect of steaming and warming

2137
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,500
So now it becomes two to balance

2138
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:41,500
After all, the cooling effect of low clouds is more important

2139
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:45,000
Is it more important for the steaming and warming effect of high clouds?

2140
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,500
Let's see which one is more

2141
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:47,500
right

2142
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,000
low cloud or high cloud

2143
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,500
Now the question is how cool is Gao Yun

2144
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:53,500
This is a big problem

2145
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:56,500
Except for the so-called cirrus clouds that you can see with your eyes

2146
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:57,500
beyond the high altitude cirrus clouds

2147
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:00,500
It's so hot that there are cirrus clouds that are invisible to the eyes

2148
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:05,440
Its eyes can't see the silver roll, not only can't see

2149
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,320
And it's very thick

2150
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,600
Its thickness is sometimes as thick as six or seven kilometers

2151
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,880
It's full of ice crystals

2152
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:14,040
But because of it, the ice crystal will grow smaller

2153
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:16,240
you can't see your eyes can't see

2154
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:18,360
So I thought it was not

2155
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:20,640
I can’t see it anymore, no, yes

2156
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:22,440
So now the question is

2157
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,200
Is that thing real or general?

2158
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,320
Now everyone will become confused

2159
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,400
So now NASA has another very important

2160
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:31,120
This mission on climate is

2161
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:32,880
to observe these things

2162
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,680
Show me every layer of these clouds

2163
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:37,320
Then observe clearly

2164
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:38,960
Only when you can truly cleanse people

2165
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:42,480
What is the role of clouds in the atmospheric environment

2166
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:44,800
The role of real text or general text

2167
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,800
This thing needs to do this

2168
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,840
This kind of observation in three-dimensional space can

2169
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,560
that's a big problem

2170
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:54,280
Because satellite observations are roughly one layer

2171
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:56,160
Most of the satellites now have better ones

2172
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:58,920
But that observation is still too far off

2173
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:00,320
Observing it from the ground is even more different

2174
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,760
There are not many quantities that can have this kind of data

2175
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:05,260
There is no information on the sea

2176
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:12,800
So the question of cloud to climate research

2177
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,760
create very, very big problems

2178
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:18,800
So why this IPCC

2179
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:23,800
This body of research climate across the board

2180
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:28,260
That is to say, for all radiation factors

2181
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:34,260
Carbon dioxide warms up, other clouds have something to cool them down

2182
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:38,020
But it turned into a big thing here

2183
01:40:38,020 --> 01:40:40,020
is its uncertainty

2184
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:43,020
because we have clouds and climates

2185
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:45,520
Just now these knots also know that there are too few

2186
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,520
Lingjie is producing clouds again

2187
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,020
If you have a lot of knots inside

2188
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:50,520
a little cloud will increase

2189
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:53,020
So it does something else that we don't understand at all

2190
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:55,520
So it has a lot of uncertainty

2191
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,520
so much uncertainty

2192
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:59,980
So this picture is often seen by many people

2193
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Why is this place often emphasized in its fourth report that

2194
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
We can only say that this thing can be determined to a certain extent

2195
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Pretty sure, slightly sure, not sure or something

2196
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Why do you use such words?

2197
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Because the cloud represents a great uncertainty

2198
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
there are worse nightmares inside

2199
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
There are also clouds in Pingliu City

2200
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
We're not right, Stratocity used to think that Stratocity was very dry

2201
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
no cloud possible

2202
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,000
But our recent observations show that Stratocity does have

2203
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
On a storm you often see

2204
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Sometimes clouds like chimneys are up there

2205
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Someone actually saw it before

2206
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
but don't know what it is

2207
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Later someone saw it and published it

2208
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
But he still doesn't know why

2209
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
It is indeed in Stratocity

2210
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
because this has been

2211
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
This really strong part

2212
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,000
The top of this storm is already at the top of Stratocity

2213
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:00,000
This so-called chimney-like chimney

2214
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,740
it's more on top of this cloud

2215
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:06,540
So it's clearly in the bottle layer

2216
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:10,000
We now know that in terms of radiation

2217
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,540
If water vapor in this vial layer

2218
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:17,540
Its role in absorbing this infrared

2219
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:20,540
It is nearly 1000 times that in the bottle layer

2220
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:22,540
So it's very powerful

2221
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:27,040
It is equivalent to building a very effective quilt in this thermal layer

2222
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:30,040
Your long-wave radiation can't escape if you want to escape.

2223
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:31,540
it's there covered

2224
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:33,040
So if there are many of these things

2225
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,040
Then this positive temperature effect is incredible.

2226
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,040
so this thing knows what's going on

2227
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:40,040
We are now gradually understanding

2228
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:41,540
This is the result of our simulation

2229
01:42:41,540 --> 01:42:43,040
indeed with that fishing mode

2230
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:46,040
You can simulate it just like what you see in that satellite

2231
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:49,040
like a chimney cloud

2232
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:51,040
So let's explain

2233
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,040
In the process of generating a machine cloud

2234
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:56,040
Due to the effect of these fluctuations

2235
01:42:56,040 --> 01:43:00,040
You can make this water vapor or even moisture

2236
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,000
From the cloud all the way to the bottle layer

2237
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,000
and then later

2238
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
it might stay there

2239
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
steam off

2240
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Then leave the air in the water completely at the bottom of the bottle layer

2241
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
so this time

2242
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Its vibration effect may be very powerful

2243
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
so what about this

2244
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
In the current climate model again

2245
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
where little is considered

2246
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
so here

2247
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Now this problem is very, very much

2248
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
So this is what we just said

2249
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
inside the vial layer

2250
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
It may have a strong effect of this addition

2251
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
And the air in the water is in the bottle layer

2252
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
it has a long lifespan

2253
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
it may have a lifespan of several years

2254
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Then once your life span is so long

2255
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
What do you think about this climate change factor

2256
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
it can be very big

2257
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:51,000
So this is the climate model guy again

2258
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
need attention

2259
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,000
So why this cloud of uncertainty

2260
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
so important

2261
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
This is one of the important reasons

2262
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,940
So when the school encounters cloud problems in the future

2263
01:44:02,940 --> 01:44:06,680
Its suspicions can be explosive like this

2264
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:08,600
I can't help it. I don't understand.

2265
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:10,640
so angry

2266
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:14,600
Because the uncertainties of the cloud are too great

2267
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:20,800
Except that this cloud has certain roles in the world

2268
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:24,140
Will human activities have any impact on the cloud?

2269
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:25,800
there must be

2270
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:28,840
The first one is what everyone calls an acid shadow

2271
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:32,480
Human industrial activities produce many such

2272
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,480
Sulfur dioxide Oxidized eggs

2273
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:38,880
Acid Shadow

2274
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:46,040
The main source of sulfur dioxide is burning coal and thermal power

2275
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:52,440
This oxidized egg reacts with the cloud to produce acid elimination

2276
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:55,080
Where does the acid-reducing oxidized egg come from?

2277
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:59,920
All magnanimous people will have this problem

2278
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,800
This is when I was about to land from Tokyo

2279
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:05,840
From the accounting network

2280
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:11,800
The entire vicinity of Tokyo is shrouded in the air of the nuclear installation

2281
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:17,160
So there are a lot of oxidation products in it.

2282
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:20,240
All of them have this phenomenon inside

2283
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:22,800
All metropolises as long as the weather is good

2284
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:24,800
acid rain

2285
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,200
Photos taken in 1908

2286
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:33,000
It's been 200 years since it was taken in 1908

2287
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,600
it's still fine

2288
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:37,000
But after another 60 years

2289
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,600
unrecognizable

2290
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:43,400
I can't see anything from the face to the nose.

2291
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:46,000
Standard Acid Rain Effects

2292
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:53,200
The second one is that the influence of the moon is Xue Humei

2293
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:57,200
Everyone should be very clear about this map.

2294
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:59,200
with tokyo influence

2295
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:07,440
During the northeast monsoon, a large pile of this kind of smoke is produced in the industrial area upstream of the industrial area

2296
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:12,960
Then they come down here with the northeast monsoon

2297
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,460
The whole is a long strip

2298
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:19,700
Japanese Jiye you can on the satellite map

2299
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:20,900
We are called MODIS

2300
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:26,540
Seen from satellites that end reliability

2301
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:28,160
often see this

2302
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:33,280
You can imagine why older

2303
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,780
Crash Island and our age

2304
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:38,160
When we were young, when it was sunny in Taiwan

2305
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:40,680
The blue sky is really very blue

2306
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:42,220
It was really blue

2307
01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:45,080
Now children may think that the blue sky is also blue now

2308
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:46,560
I tell you now the blue sky is not blue at all

2309
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:50,680
Now the sky is blue, the sky is sunny, and the sky is gray

2310
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:53,520
not at all blue

2311
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,080
Why

2312
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:57,120
too clear

2313
01:46:57,120 --> 01:47:00,040
Because the neighbor next door generates a lot of

2314
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
so there is no way

2315
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Here's a lot of human influence on this levitation example

2316
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
look at its different colors

2317
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,000
It's the smog and the clean sea

2318
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
This contrast is too great

2319
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
We don't even have that color here

2320
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
the color we have here

2321
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,000
It's almost the picture of this kind of satellite that I often look at

2322
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:26,000
We Taiwanese nurses rarely see such a blue sea color

2323
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Must be through this more smoky color

2324
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,000
This is the distribution of small particles of PM2.5 around the world

2325
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,000
There is a lot of this kind of fine dust in the desert

2326
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,000
because it's a desert

2327
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
But eastern China is clearly not a desert

2328
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
But you can also see

2329
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
industrial impact

2330
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,000
This is almost now the highest region in the world

2331
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
most concentrated area

2332
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,500
So the northeast monsoon comes down

2333
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:04,220
Taiwan is sure to enjoy

2334
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:11,780
OK is the Xionghu Weili team

2335
01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:13,060
already said

2336
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:15,460
The first increases the number of condensation nuclei

2337
01:48:15,460 --> 01:48:17,660
If the concentration of water aeration is the same

2338
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:22,860
The size of cloud water droplets will become smaller

2339
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:24,860
Cloud particles get smaller

2340
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:26,060
it will become more stable

2341
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:28,460
If the cloud strength is stable, it will be less likely to rain

2342
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:30,460
once it doesn't rain

2343
01:48:30,460 --> 01:48:33,460
It is less likely to wash away the paint dust

2344
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:35,960
So the possibility of air pollution

2345
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:38,460
higher and higher

2346
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:39,460
Then what

2347
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:41,960
Because condensation nuclei may dissolve in the water

2348
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:43,060
condensation nuclei

2349
01:48:43,060 --> 01:48:44,860
it may be relatively strong water droplets

2350
01:48:44,860 --> 01:48:46,660
easier to spill

2351
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:48,460
then we know that means

2352
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:50,960
a highly concentrated droplet

2353
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,660
it is less accretive

2354
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:53,460
dirty water

2355
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:55,260
You see usually it's not very accretive

2356
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:56,660
Clean water is easy to multiply

2357
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:57,660
dirty water on the ground

2358
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:59,660
Things on the ground last longer

2359
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,600
the same in the cloud

2360
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:02,800
As long as the cloud is dirty

2361
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,400
That cloud will last a little longer

2362
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:10,300
There are usually more clouds, which increase the albedo

2363
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:11,800
it lowers the surface temperature

2364
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:14,800
seriously pollute the air

2365
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:19,300
OK but there's a lot more in it

2366
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:21,100
We have no mention of electrical effects

2367
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:24,700
because time is not enough

2368
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:27,000
so many things

2369
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,800
your best bet is

2370
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,400
if you have a way to fly to the sky

2371
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:31,400
Then look from below

2372
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:33,200
Now of course we can't fly

2373
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:35,200
But someone flew for us

2374
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,200
This is called the International Space Station

2375
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:40,200
So this one might take that voice and put it

2376
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,400
Push to

2377
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
look down

2378
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:07,640
pile of lightning

2379
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
pile of lightning

2380
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:07,000
OK, thank you all for today

2381
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Thank you Jin Tai for the speech this last game last this

2382
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Very good at shooting outer space to see the earth

2383
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
ok we have 10 minutes to start

2384
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,000
do we have any questions please

2385
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
consult

2386
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:27,000
ask the professor

2387
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Just now the professor mentioned many kinds of

2388
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,000
For example, Jiyin, Jianying, and Chen Jiyin

2389
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Please teach me the number sound of tornado

2390
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
what type of sound thanks

2391
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
he has nothing to do with either

2392
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
He said something completely different

2393
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
You are sounding like the fluctuating sound I mentioned just now

2394
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Also not included in the earliest mentioned

2395
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
He is another way of classifying

2396
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:05,000
So Long Jianfeng, rolled up, is that a cloud?

2397
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
that's cloud

2398
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
that cloud

2399
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
That cloud is not a cloud

2400
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Clouds are just about light

2401
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:19,000
So the one that was rolled up by the wind of dragon inspection

2402
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
That name is Lu Douyun

2403
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Lu Douyun

2404
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,000
He looks like Ludo

2405
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Gradually

2406
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Thanks

2407
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
good

2408
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Director Wang

2409
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Excuse me

2410
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,000
That is, the continental climate will obviously

2411
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
It is the polluted road that will obviously pollute Taiwan

2412
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,000
That's our main polluting line

2413
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
That is to say, the northeast monsoon

2414
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
The Northeast is not a continent

2415
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,000
The Northeast comes from Japan and the Pacific Ocean.

2416
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
So why the mainland

2417
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
going in such a strange direction

2418
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
blow to Taiwan

2419
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
The northeast monsoon is only because

2420
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
to us is northeast

2421
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
But from the original place, I don’t think it’s the Northeast

2422
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
that domineering transfer

2423
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,600
In fact, it is mostly a circular motion.

2424
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:03,600
a little more

2425
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:05,100
it won't say from there

2426
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:06,700
It's all the way from the northeast

2427
01:54:06,700 --> 01:54:08,300
not like this

2428
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:09,200
so this situation

2429
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:11,500
It's like bypassing Japan and coming back.

2430
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:14,500
Bypass Japan, South Korea and come again

2431
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:15,400
so keep coming

2432
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:17,200
Another little problem is that

2433
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:20,600
Just mentioned that water vapor is the main greenhouse gas

2434
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:22,800
But crocodile carbon is man-made

2435
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:25,100
a greenhouse gas that has been increasing

2436
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:27,100
After the crocodile carbon dioxide increases

2437
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:28,500
until the temperature increases

2438
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:32,800
Does the increase in temperature increase the stability of the earth's water vapor?

2439
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,000
After that lift up

2440
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,300
The temperature increased further

2441
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:39,000
Will it have such a vicious effect?

2442
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:41,800
this has a possibility

2443
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:43,000
not completely impossible

2444
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,100
But now when reading this article

2445
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:47,200
On a yearly scale

2446
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:49,000
more water vapor

2447
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,400
Rainfall will also increase

2448
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:52,800
because of the source of moisture

2449
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:55,200
The source of that rain is water vapor

2450
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:56,800
So you make water vapor and rain increase

2451
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:59,100
So on a yearly basis

2452
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:00,000
Take it easy

2453
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
These two should balance each other

2454
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
So the annual flower increase and the annual precipitation

2455
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
The two should just cancel out

2456
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
So for the whole year

2457
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
That is, on average, the amount of air in water in your earth

2458
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
indeed will increase

2459
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
But the rainfall will also increase

2460
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:20,000
But what you just asked probably meant

2461
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
The increased air volume in the water

2462
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Will it increase the temperature inside the earth?

2463
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
the answer is yes

2464
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
And the so-called warming

2465
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
It is mentioned in the mode that this calculation is included in it.

2466
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,000
I've already factored in this warming up.

2467
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,000
good

2468
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
is there any problem

2469
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
professor

2470
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Just that video, the last video

2471
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
It's like burning the physiology

2472
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
what does that mean

2473
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,000
There are not many, but the one that seems to be on fire

2474
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
you say green red

2475
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
red a lot like

2476
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
The one that burns like magma

2477
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,000
That's actually in space

2478
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
That's called Aurora

2479
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:10,000
like the aurora borealis

2480
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Are there so many auroras?

2481
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
why is it light

2482
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
the red one all over the place

2483
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
fixed bit by bit

2484
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
very many

2485
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
That is the night in the city

2486
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
of course you see a little

2487
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
you don't really see a light

2488
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Lights across the metropolitan area

2489
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Maybe it's in space

2490
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
waste time

2491
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
The whole, for example, the whole of Taipei City

2492
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
just see a little

2493
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
it's a light like this

2494
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
all covered

2495
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
are all cities

2496
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Thanks

2497
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
we just want to ask

2498
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
you just mentioned

2499
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
We currently lack global

2500
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
3D Cloud Observation

2501
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
then i'm curious

2502
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
is there any possibility

2503
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,660
can proceed

2504
01:57:01,660 --> 01:57:02,540
because we usually now see

2505
01:57:02,540 --> 01:57:04,240
just look up from the ground

2506
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:06,300
looking down from the sky

2507
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:07,700
just to see the flickering

2508
01:57:07,700 --> 01:57:09,500
is there any possibility

2509
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:10,040
Thanks

2510
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:13,540
And the possibility is that

2511
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:17,640
It's better to have a lot of these tactics

2512
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:20,540
One of the current satellites is

2513
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:22,700
a cloud radar

2514
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:25,700
That cloud moon called Clausian

2515
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:28,400
It is different from ordinary satellites

2516
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:30,900
Ordinary satellites are cloud satellites that use visible photosynthesis

2517
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:31,400
look

2518
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:33,000
But what you see is a plane equal to this

2519
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,300
just one layer

2520
01:57:34,300 --> 01:57:36,500
This new relatively new relic

2521
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:38,400
it can penetrate

2522
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:39,200
it can penetrate

2523
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:42,900
Then in theory it could see several layers

2524
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:44,900
The current satellite

2525
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:47,000
it is not a geostationary satellite

2526
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:47,900
If geostationary satellite

2527
01:57:47,900 --> 01:57:51,900
It says it can be 24 hours a day

2528
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:53,500
all have been watching

2529
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:55,900
At present, this kind of satellite is only a kind of orbiting satellite

2530
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:57,200
So it just selects

2531
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:58,500
just for a certain period of time

2532
01:57:58,500 --> 01:57:59,800
so the data

2533
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,340
incomplete is

2534
01:58:01,340 --> 01:58:03,340
but there is a possibility in the future

2535
01:58:03,340 --> 01:58:05,840
If we say that the future technology is so high that

2536
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:07,540
Pompeo also has such a thing

2537
01:58:07,540 --> 01:58:08,640
There is also this radar

2538
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,240
There is also this cloud radar

2539
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:14,940
From such a high altitude of tens of thousands of kilometers

2540
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:17,340
penetrate the ground and make observations

2541
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:18,640
that's possible

2542
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:21,540
This kind of global 3D observation is possible

2543
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:25,580
Professor OK Wang

2544
01:58:25,580 --> 01:58:27,840
thank you for a very good presentation

2545
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:28,580
I have a question

2546
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:30,980
You mean the water and water vapor on the earth

2547
01:58:30,980 --> 01:58:32,320
Is it constant

2548
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:35,780
won't it disappear into space

2549
01:58:35,780 --> 01:58:37,120
Yes

2550
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:39,120
if so far

2551
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:42,480
Disappeared because no one observed

2552
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:44,620
So since no one observed

2553
01:58:44,620 --> 01:58:47,180
We assume it is always

2554
01:58:47,180 --> 01:58:49,820
always balanced

2555
01:58:49,820 --> 01:58:51,480
so many things are said

2556
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:55,680
Let's just say we haven't seen evidence to the contrary

2557
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:57,820
That is to say, we don't know for sure

2558
01:58:57,820 --> 01:59:00,060
The water in the earth is increasing

2559
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,360
Maybe there is a lot of water coming in from outer space, we don't know

2560
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:06,360
So do you think there is such a possibility?

2561
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:07,840
Of course it's possible

2562
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:09,840
It's just that we have nothing to do with it

2563
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:13,340
Directly connected to the earth, there is another promise

2564
01:59:13,340 --> 01:59:15,080
That's what we call Jiawan

2565
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:17,200
After oxidation, the pill will produce water

2566
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:19,200
That's really putting it together

2567
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:22,600
A lot of steamed juice is due to the oxidation of Jiawan

2568
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:24,600
The generated water vapor is over there

2569
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:26,500
So now if the ground is like

2570
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:29,800
If more and more such pills are released underground,

2571
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:31,600
after it is oxidized

2572
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:33,600
it produces oxidized water

2573
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:35,400
likely to increase

2574
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:38,800
It's also possible that this is another possible measure

2575
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:40,800
ok last question

2576
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,800
ask teacher wang

2577
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,200
you just mentioned that there are

2578
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:48,700
Tiny particles with negative subscale sizes cannot be sucked down by rainwater

2579
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:52,200
If so, will there be more and more pollutants in the air?

2580
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:53,700
ah

2581
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:58,000
it gets to a point where it might reach a certain balance

2582
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,200
not always

2583
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,000
take that sentence back in half

2584
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:08,000
If humans do not go too far

2585
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,000
if humans go too far

2586
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Then I think it will keep increasing

2587
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Because it will exceed the nature of this

2588
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:20,000
This efficiency in removing pollution from the air

2589
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Once you exceed this limit

2590
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
it keeps increasing

2591
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
This is the so-called wrong away

2592
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
just follow

2593
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
we all know why

2594
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
elaborate why make me hot

2595
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Because its soup is called wrong away

2596
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
it can't be balanced

2597
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
A water vapor it is the same as the earth

2598
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Its water vapor also flowed from the ground

2599
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
it pops out of the ground

2600
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
we are tough here

2601
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
then we will take business

2602
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
because it is too close to the sun

2603
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
it's too hot

2604
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
so it's been water vapor

2605
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
it broke down shortly after

2606
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
So its water vapor decomposes

2607
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
so it's not in its atmosphere

2608
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
So that elaborate atmosphere

2609
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
That's hundreds of times the weight of the earth

2610
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Because its air-conditioning is not like ours running into the sea

2611
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
no , not gas

2612
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
it's always been inside its origin

2613
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
So this great potential

2614
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:13,000
There's no way it can go back, there's no way it can be balanced

2615
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Then what I just said at this time

2616
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
If human beings are always in the air

2617
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
send in this

2618
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
so many particles

2619
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
someday

2620
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:26,000
The forces of nature cannot remove

2621
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
this time is

2622
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,000
It is not stipulated, this is point on no return

2623
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
it's possible

2624
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:38,000
OK, let's thank Director Wang again

2625
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:41,000
thank you all
