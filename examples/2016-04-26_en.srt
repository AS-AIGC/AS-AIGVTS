00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,900
OK

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,480

24
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,740
Go

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,040
come tell us about this

26
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,340
See the world from your phone

27
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,880
i think we are now

28
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,180
indeed every day

29
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,740
Everyone can't live without their mobile phone

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,100
So this topic should be of interest to many people.

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,440
Interest also took the opportunity to learn

32
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,720
including me

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,080
We all say that the older the person, the less likely he is to use the phone

34
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,900
I am one of them so today also

35
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,700
hope to wait

36
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:30,980
become

37
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,520
slightly to the phone

38
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,820
know a little

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,420
Let me briefly introduce our keynote speaker today

40
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,480
learning experience

41
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,520

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He is currently a Fellow of ACM and a Fellow of IEEE

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
His works have also won the TECO Award

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It is also regarded as an engineering award in China

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Also received three National Science Council Dismissal Awards

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is the predecessor of the Ministry of Science and Technology

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000

Society of Electrical Engineers Contact Electrical Engineering Professor Award

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And too big a teaching award, etc.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I won't waste your time anymore

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
we are also very much looking forward to

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,900
Can get a little more information in the future

72
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,900
Thanks

73
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,900
please

74
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,700
Thank you very very much Vice President

75
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,500
When the vice president asked me to talk about a topic?

76
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,100
I just thought of what to say best

77
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,500
Because the phone is always on

78
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,000
I just thought that this machine is in my hand, hope is endless

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
OK

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,500
So let’s talk about viewing the world from your mobile phone

81
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,300
Well, this topic

82
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,800
I was once in a popular science speech

83
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
slightly mentioned

84
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,200
If you have seen

85
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Take what you have heard as a review

86
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,800
Of course everyone has a cell phone

87
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,600
Everyone says why smartphones are smart

88
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
people often ask this question

89
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,400
So what's the difference with the previous mobile phone?

90
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Then I want to look at it from this angle

91
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,600
See the world from your phone

92
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,800
If you look at the world from your mobile phone

93
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,200
I'm bound to talk about the phone and what's around it

94
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,300
so therefore

95
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,200
Here I choose to speak with Android

96
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,800
Because Android has the highest market share

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,260
80% of all mobile phones equals 82%

98
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,600
are so-called Android phones

99
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,760
So from the perspective of Android

100
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,760
So let's talk about Android and its environment

101
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,060
Of course when it comes to this

102
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,560
we'll look back

103
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,300
Why is it called a smartphone

104
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,600
isn't it just a mobile phone

105
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,060
let's just call

106
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,100
Why is it called a smartphone

107
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,100
Remember everyone will find out

108
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,960
I actually do a lot of things on my phone

109
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,760
That seems to answer all kinds of questions I have.

110
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,920
so i think it's a smartphone

111
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,740
In that case maybe we should see

112
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,040
This so-called smart phone

113
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,740
what's behind

114
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,140
can bring us these wisdom

115
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,440
Of course everyone said

116
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,940
what if that's the case

117
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,840
I should be more and more established

118
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,040
or use my phone

119
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,140
Everything is on my phone

120
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,040
like me now

121
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,640
I listen to music on my phone

122
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,680
What about taking pictures?

123
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,180
In fact, most of the photos I took are also on my mobile phone.

124
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,380
i think most of you here

125
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,880
They must be taking pictures with their cell phones.

126
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,740
well maybe so

127
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,520
I am like this

128
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,880
I stopped buying cameras many years ago

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,800
because my cell phone works fine

130
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,760
After I finished taking the photo, he uploaded it directly to the Internet.

131
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,760
and it's easy to share with others

132
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,460
I can use that

133
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,300
these different messaging programs

134
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,100
I can send it to anyone

135
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,600
perfectly worked

136
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,000
Of course, after Shu Bodong got on the phone

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,760
you should ask a question

138
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,760
Will he be like my personal computer one day

139
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,260
There is a virus in

140
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,460
one day when you open

141
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,000
he appears blue

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,560
you can't make phone calls

143
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,000
what to do

144
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,960
or

145
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,760
I put all my stuff on my phone

146
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,760
one day he told you

147
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,160
Sorry, the address book is gone

148
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,320
do you feel panicked

149
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,660
I think everyone has this problem

150
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,660
that's not all

151
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,960
When Shu Bodong got on the phone

152
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,060
Everyone is like me, I carry my mobile phone with me every day

153
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,460
Every morning when I go out without my mobile phone

154
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,160
I feel weird today

155
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,260
That's not true, everyone

156
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,860
you will find many things

157
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,060
Began to connect more and more with the mobile phone

158
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,660
why do you feel a little flustered

159
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,060
if you do not have

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,240
go out without a mobile phone

161
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,440
now because

162
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,440
This is how other people contact you

163
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,440
You use these methods to quickly send some text messages to people

164
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,940
so convenient

165
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,740
Slowly you may find that

166
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,740
You will become more and more dependent on your mobile phone

167
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,600
Why

168
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,440
Everyone has heard of the Internet of Things, right?

169
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,240
Internet of Everything

170
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,040
What things will be connected to the Internet?

171
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,240
In fact, you can imagine the future

172
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,440
your glasses

173
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,240
It's like the Google glasses you see, right?

174
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,440
Many people will wear all kinds of things in the future

175
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
always like your current logger

176
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,480
There are still many things you will hang on your body in the future

177
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,480
even wear it

178
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,480
At this time, you will find that you don’t leave your mobile phone anymore

179
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,980
because everything is connected

180
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,980
after everything is connected

181
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,780
I ask you

182
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,780
Would you like to pay a phone bill per device

183
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,780
of course not right

184
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,780
In the end, everything can be sent to your mobile phone

185
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,780
So when you don't have your phone

186
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,780
I believe you will be more anxious

187
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,280
ok there is no way

188
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,320
because

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,760
This is some further development

190
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,560
So I want to take this opportunity today

191
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,060
We watched it all the way from the phone

192
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,060
See what this idea of ​​the future of IoT could look like

193
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,760
Everyone look at your phone

194
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,860
Do you guys only have a cell phone to call?

195
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,560
Believers raise hands

196
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,760
No, no, no one believes, right?

197
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,700
Can a computer make phone calls before?

198
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,560
The computer can't make phone calls, right?

199
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,920
Since the beginning of the so-called video telephony

200
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,460
The computer starts to make phone calls

201
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,060
then you find one thing

202
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,620
Computers used to do these calculations and data processing for me

203
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,020
i can surf the internet i can shop

204
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,820
can play electric toys

205
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,260
Mobile phones seem to be able to do this now.

206
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,220
So therefore you start to have an idea

207
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,660
The world of mobile phones and computers has actually begun to integrate

208
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,020
these two things put together

209
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,260
In the past, we applied to the telecom company for a door number

210
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,120
receive his telecommunications service

211
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,280
And these telecommunications services from

212
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,340
From domestic calls, long-distance calls, international calls, transferred conference calls, etc.

213
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,740
These are the services provided by the telecommunications company to you.

214
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,240
what about now you start to think about it

215
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,640
seems different

216
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,980
What about my phone company, whether it's Chunghwa Telecom or Taiwan Mobile?

217
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,580
It seems that it is not the same as before

218
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,880
not like a phone company

219
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,480
Fast glasses that function as smartphones

220
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,480
Internet access has become very convenient

221
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,280
you also noticed one thing

222
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,620
It seems that the world of the Internet and the world of telecommunications have begun to merge

223
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,620
The formerly so-called world of telecommunications

224
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,820
It's as if we call the phone company that provides our service

225
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,920
It is they who provide us with the contact method of telecommunications

226
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,560
The Internet used to belong to our computers only.

227
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,020
Now what about these telecommunications companies that provide you with Internet access

228
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,060
It also provides your telecommunications services from now on

229
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,960
Then you will find that there are some so-called

230
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,300
This Internet company, he also started a telecommunications company business

231
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,100
Of course this means

232
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,200
what's starting to come together

233
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,800
In addition, your mobile phone is no longer a phone call.

234
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,200
Think about how many things you do on your phone

235
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,600
let me ask you first

236
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,800
Everyone, you want to know the weather this morning

237
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,700
Or if it rains, how many people check the computer

238
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,600
How many people look at their mobile phones

239
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,200
I look at my phone OK

240
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,600
Many people look at their phones, right?

241
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,200
Because it's so convenient that everything is on top

242
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,100
OK there are all kinds of software on it

243
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,900
You can download and use

244
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
In the past you had to find a software

245
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,200
Is it troublesome to install it on your computer?

246
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
You need someone to pretend for you, right?

247
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,300
now you have an android phone

248
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,400
or you have an iPhone

249
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,300
you need to install new software

250
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,300
Many of you may come to his

251
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,100
His so-called market

252
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,700
or play a different site

253
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,000
directly downloaded

254
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,900
one click and it will come down

255
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,400
So actually

256
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,300
Everything seems to be very, very convenient

257
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,700
Everything starts to concentrate on your phone

258
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,000
Extremely convenient to use

259
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
so we'll look back

260
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What are you using your phone for?

261
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let’s give a few examples of an application that everyone sees very often.

262
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
For example, if you say

263
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
you need to check the map

264
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
you will find out

265
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
If according to some of our past data

266
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
you can tell

267
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
most people are on mobile

268
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The blue part is the mobile phone

269
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The orange part is the computer

270
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Most people just look up the map

271
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I actually checked it on my phone.

272
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The weather is also on the phone

273
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Listen to music on your phone

274
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
you and others are using some facebook

275
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
In fact, many people have also gone to the mobile phone

276
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
If you don't believe me, go home and see your children

277
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
where to go to facebook

278
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
so you will find

279
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Actually a lot of work

280
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
what we used to do on the computer

281
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Slowly all moved to the mobile phone

282
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
because it's so convenient

283
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And it has so many functions

284
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
OK

285
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
good

286
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
of course

287
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
from this point of view

288
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
let's ask another question

289
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
OK

290
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I want to address these so-called

291
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
For mobile phone users

292
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
what jobs are you looking for

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,560
do it on top or look at it from another angle

294
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
you will notice

295
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,860
I want to send some messages to someone

296
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,460
I'm 90% on my phone

297
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,360
Just like you are using Line

298
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,860
Or work with your Messenger etc.

299
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,660
ok photos

300
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,360
you are not the only ones

301
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,760
83% of people do the same thing as you

302
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,460
send email?

303
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,460
Many people also do it on mobile phones

304
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,760
There are many, many jobs that do this

305
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,060
And of course there's a tablet, right?

306
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,320
Of course, the tablet is also a big usage environment.

307
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,820
Of course you can find out

308
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,020
a lot of searches

309
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,220
Some things will still be done on the tablet

310
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,220
Why because the screen is bigger

311
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,520
OK good

312
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,560
But what?

313
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,520
Everyone, the world will gradually change

314
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,760
OK, let's look at it from another angle

315
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,620
how to use mobile phone how to use mobile phone

316
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,820
Guys, let's look at it from two angles

317
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,020
what if

318
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,720
You're using a browser on your phone to search for something

319
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,660
Looking for information OK

320
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,520
what kind of work is done on it

321
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,820
what did you watch

322
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Of course you have something here

323
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,300
Like Google, Facebook, etc.

324
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,400
This is done with Browseing

325
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,200
But I have to say on the phone

326
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,600
because it has a small screen

327
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,100
In fact, what do most people use

328
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,700
In fact, most people use RUN App

329
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,800
These so-called applications

330
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,700
What about the app?

331
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,600
In fact, like Facebook, Facebook, etc.

332
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,400
are the most used

333
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,700
Okay, of course we're here

334
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,900
You should probably agree

335
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,600
You do a lot on your phone

336
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,000
Then let's first define what is called App

337
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,700
What is an application

338
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,600
What about the application, the so-called App

339
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,800
refers to the smartphone

340
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
on tablet

341
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,700
or even on some mobile devices

342
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,200
some apps used

343
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,600
We call it App

344
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,400
OK

345
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,500
Well, if you have an app, someone will sell your app

346
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,200
OK so all these apps

347
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,000
There are so-called App stores

348
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,600
Just like you can see in Apple

349
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,000
Or even in Taiwan Mobile

350
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,600
They all have these apps

351
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,400
OK

352
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,100
well that

353
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,960
The so-called store of these apps

354
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,100
It allows mobile device users

355
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,460
Internet via Wi-Fi

356
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,400
An app connected to a mobile network

357
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,460
store for this app

358
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,360
Download your program for free or for a fee

359
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,100
Then it's easy to put on it

360
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,160
Then these so-called App stores

361
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,360
In the beginning, of course, it was Apple

362
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,460
A year later, Google came out with

363
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,460
Of course there will be more and more

364
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,060
First App Store

365
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,220
when it was founded by apple

366
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,520
It's not just for the iPhone

367
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,720
Your iPad Touch

368
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,020
And these larger tablets for the iPad

369
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,420
so that everyone can publish

370
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,420
and be able to download these associated programs

371
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,820
Then of course anyone starts to feel that

372
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,320
Then I can also write my App

373
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,920
I upload and I can also sell it to others

374
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,320
So it’s not just about downloading and using

375
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,460
It also makes selling easier

376
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,720
you can go up directly

377
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,880
anyone can put something

378
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,760
It's easy to sell to someone in another corner of the world

379
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,600
So many things changed accordingly

380
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,160
What app stores are there?

381
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,760
For example, Apple's App Store

382
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,760
And there's Google's called Play

383
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
they all have a name

384
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,260
Windows is called Phone Store

385
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,760
The so-called black media machine

386
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,560
Blackberry also has its

387
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,260
and Amazon's

388
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,360
and Samsung

389
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,860
Of course not only these things

390
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,960
Let's say this is Windows

391
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,960
This is Apple's App Store

392
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
Then everyone can upload it

393
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,460
Of course if you want to upload

394
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,960
Inside Apple he asked to say

395
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,460
you have to pay the annual fee

396
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,460
He usually pays about 99 dollars a year

397
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,460
I can become his member

398
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,960
if i want to upload something

399
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,460
he has to check first

400
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,960
then you can download

401
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,460
If he sells you something for 100 bucks

402
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,460
He wants to draw 30 yuan

403
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,460
Of course the developer

404
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,460
You can get 70 yuan

405
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,960
ok of course

406
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The 30 yuan he claimed was for maintenance and other expenses

407
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,500
Not only Apple

408
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,500
Of course, Google will also join the battle soon

409
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,000
He is now called Google Play

410
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,500
also the same

411
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,000
But Google is a little different

412
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,200
Where is it?

413
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Google says I only charge you once

414
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,500
like 25 dollars

415
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,000
It can be used for life from now on

416
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
you don't have to pay me every year

417
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,700
But Google has another idea

418
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,300
He said that anyone can upload and anyone can download

419
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,800
But of course you imagine

420
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,300
if it is like this

421
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,800
you have an app

422
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,300
It is easier for you to upload

423
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,800
Of course bad guys can upload

424
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,800
so what does it mean

425
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Everyone throws things up

426
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,300
Then you can just pull the thing down and use it

427
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
will you be poisoned

428
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,300
Wait, these problems may follow

429
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Of course it's the other way around

430
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,300
if someone censored

431
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,300
You say it's safer

432
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,300
But the problem is more troublesome

433
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
You have waited for a long time and haven't put it on the shelves

434
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,800
even sometimes doubt

435
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,200
Apple may have deliberately kept him out of the shelves

436
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,600
because he might be doing something like that

437
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,400
Of course these are all possible predictions

438
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,700
Not only that, he also does Windows

439
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,300
Just like you guys on your Windows tablet

440
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,300
Now even on your PC

441
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
You put Windows 8, Windows 10

442
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,700
You can download it in his App Store

443
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,300
can download some of your software

444
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,200
installed on your computer

445
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,300
And of course your phone

446
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,100
more than that

447
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,600
Taiwan's telecom operators also want to count this business

448
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,100
So the telecom operator also provided him with the App Store

449
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,100
You can also download your stuff

450
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,300
Like Chunghwa Telecom doing this Hami

451
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,900
Of course, Yuanchuan also does this.

452
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,700
you can imagine

453
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,400
If this is the case, of course the Taiwan Revolutionary Committee will also do this.

454
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,600
OK

455
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,900
Do you only have telecom companies doing this?

456
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,200
of course not

457
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,300
OK

458
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,000
Of course what else is included?

459
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,800
Including mobile phones like Samsung

460
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,200
he also wants to do this business

461
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,700
Bigger wants to sell things

462
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,400
OK

463
00:17:59,400 --> 00:17:59,900
good

464
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Let's compare a little bit with these so-called App Store

465
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
you can see

466
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,300
Whether it is Apple or

467
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,200
Windows is also good

468
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,000
Google is also good

469
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Or Chunghwa Telecom, Far EasTone, etc.

470
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,900
They both serve different operating systems

471
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,600
like some like this one

472
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,200
This may be Taiwan's Big Brother

473
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,200
He basically said that there are many service providers

474
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,400
Not just Windows

475
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,000
and including Apple's

476
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,600
Also includes Android

477
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
they all have different ideas

478
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,600
to compete with each other in the market

479
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
But they all have a share

480
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,600
because he could be a good source of profit

481
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,600
There is an App Store

482
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
from above

483
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Many apps can be downloaded for use

484
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
of course like this

485
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
before i go on

486
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
I'll go back and do a little more with you guys.

487
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Introduce the idea of ​​Android

488
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
and its environment

489
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Let's look at what's behind it

490
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Do you have any questions?

491
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Welcome to ask questions or click me

492
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Let's answer together later

493
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Ok Android what is Android?

494
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Android is an open source

495
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
open source operating system

496
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
A Linux-based platform

497
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So its bottom layer is a Linux operating system

498
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It has some environment on it

499
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
so we call it a platform

500
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
what to say now

501
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Google's entire ecosystem

502
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
resulting action platform

503
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
fastest growing in the world

504
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It now holds about 82% of a market

505
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Of course it's not just the phone.

506
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
you should notice

507
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
including some TV platforms like

508
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
There are many starting to adopt Android

509
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
ok that's natural

510
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Then everyone will say come down again

511
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's not just your phone

512
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
not just your tv

513
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You should also notice that Apple and Google

514
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
want to sell stuff to put on your car

515
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
OK, of course it's not just like that

516
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,760
After doing some business and thinking about wearing fashion later

517
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,000
Is there any way how to make a connection with him?

518
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,200
Okay, let's talk about this topic later.

519
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,760
Of course, this is just to give you a feeling.

520
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,760
Underneath is the core of a Linux operating system

521
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,260
Above the whole thing Android

522
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,760
They thought of this set of things to put on top of this core

523
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,760
different developers

524
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,000
has its different roles to play

525
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,360
For example, some developers in Taiwan

526
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,860
he does some hardware stuff

527
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,620
He can stuff relevant things into this Korean library

528
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,620
It can be easily plugged into the whole system.

529
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,620
Of course, this forms an entire ecosystem on top of it.

530
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,620
well that

531
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Let me first tell you what an operating system is

532
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,120
The operating system is when you turn on the computer

533
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,120
just kept running

534
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,620
The program that ends after you shut down is called the operating system

535
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,620
Just like the operating system on your personal computer is Windows

536
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,620
OK

537
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,620
That's on your phone Android

538
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,380
is your platform

539
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The whole platform runs on it

540
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
OK

541
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
In other words

542
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It is an environment between our users and the hardware

543
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
All hardware it controls

544
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Services that provide all our stuff

545
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
that's up there

546
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
you can directly manipulate it

547
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You can also run some apps on it

548
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Let everyone see some different APPs

549
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
OK

550
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Or those who see you running

551
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
This Word Powerpoint and so on these software

552
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
well these are

553
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
what about these things

554
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
application software

555
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
it runs on top of the operating system

556
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
The operating system directly controls your hardware

557
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What is the mainstream operating system now?

558
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
what about the first one

559
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Of course Unix and Linux series

560
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What about Linux?

561
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I just reported to you

562
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The operating system running under Android

563
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
OK

564
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
then it's an open source

565
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Wait a minute and I'll report to you

566
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What is Open Source

567
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
OK

568
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Then they belong to a similar series

569
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
We say the series of Unix and Linux

570
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And Unix

571
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
At Bell

572
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Developed at Bell Laboratories

573
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,800
Developed from 1971 to 73

574
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,000
Then began to produce some branches

575
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
in 1977

576
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
There is another branch called Berkeley Distribution

577
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
A fork of Berkeley's version of this

578
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And these things are called open source

579
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
First of all what is open source

580
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Open source is the software

581
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's written down this program it must be open

582
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
able to spread freely

583
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Basically its spirit is like this

584
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Mocking Touch's Always is made by Apple companies

585
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
This is another mainstream operating system

586
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Another one is that you are very common

587
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Windows commercial operating system on personal computers

588
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Alright then let's move on to Lenax

589
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Because it is the most important core under Android

590
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Lenax was actually a student at the time

591
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
He thinks these are used in class

592
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The homework system used for teaching is really bad

593
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So he read a book and made one

594
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
From now on everyone will be fine

595
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I just started adding things in.

596
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,440
The first version was in 1991

597
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,600
Published on the Internet in September

598
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,840
Since then, everyone has continued to add things to it.

599
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
more prosperous

600
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,300
we just knew

601
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,000
Lenix it is at the bottom of the whole Android

602
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,700
It hosts the entirety of our Android operating system

603
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,900
Under the hood it's basically an open software operating system

604
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,100
OK good

605
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,300
Then I will introduce one more thing to you now.

606
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,900
Called Open Handset Alliance

607
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:39,700
OK a coalition of so-called open handsets

608
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,000
What is the Alliance for Open Handheld Devices?

609
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,800
In fact, this thing is launched by Google

610
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Because why is Google launching this thing

611
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,200
Google it's very smart

612
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,900
OK Google says I'm going to do this business now

613
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,800
What should I do with Windows

614
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,900
Windows said how much I would sell you for an operating system

615
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,400
He said I don't need money OK

616
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
But what money does he earn from you?

617
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
he earns advertising money

618
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
OK

619
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Because once the operating system without money

620
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Let's do it together

621
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
After making these phones?

622
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Sowen

623
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
All the traffic flows to my Google

624
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
'Cause everyone's coming to me

625
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I know what you want to do

626
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And you are on my network

627
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'll show you the ad

628
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I just pay advertisers

629
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
so therefore

630
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
He told you no money

631
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Because he takes money from others

632
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
OK

633
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
What about Windows?

634
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
he wants to sell you this thing

635
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I found out that your things don't cost money

636
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So of course Window is in trouble

637
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
That

638
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Google wants to do this business

639
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Of course he can't do it by himself.

640
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So he told a bunch of people

641
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Let's make a mobile phone together

642
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
make money together

643
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So he formed this organization

644
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
A Consortium of Open Handsets

645
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
He organized such an alliance

646
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
just say

647
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Telecom provider Mobile phone provider

648
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
do hardware

649
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
all together

650
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
let's make a phone

651
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
my operating system is free

652
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
OK let's do it together

653
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
That quickly assembled dozens of companies

654
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
OK let's do it together

655
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That sounds good, of course, right?

656
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But he wants to make money in the end

657
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
OK of course this so-called this

658
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
This open hand holds this alliance

659
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
he has a great mission

660
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
He said he hoped to make a better mobile phone

661
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
to our users

662
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And everything is open

663
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
OK

664
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And what if you have any vision

665
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
we'll make it happen

666
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
just his basic idea

667
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
OK, smart, right?

668
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So, a lot of people started to struggle to come together and do it together.

669
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Telecom providers include telecom providers in various places at home and abroad

670
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
OK, some of you have also seen OK

671
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Including this everyone see this T-Mobile in the US

672
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Very European Vodafone

673
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Or on the mainland, China Mobile, etc.

674
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Handset for mobile phones

675
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Like our Acer and other companies

676
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Or chip companies like ARM

677
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,800
Or software companies like Google Ibe, etc.

678
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,400
Or do some commercial companies

679
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
For example, the companies he consults with

680
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,000
Everyone tangled together to make a mobile phone together

681
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,800
OK, that's of course very smart.

682
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,400
soon to be a fad

683
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,800
swept the market very quickly

684
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,600
Because everyone in this ecosystem

685
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,000
can have a share

686
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,800
OK so everyone come in and do it

687
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,400
So after everyone has done

688
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,800
Sure enough, a lot of traffic flows into Google

689
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,200
OK then they make a lot of money

690
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,600
OK his basic story goes like this

691
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,000
OK, then I just mentioned

692
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Lenix is ​​also good

693
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,800
Android is also good

694
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
It's an open source concept

695
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,000
open that is

696
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,800
I bring this thing, I can change it

697
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
I should give it to someone else after I'm done

698
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,000
OK so the concept of open source

699
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
that I'm free to walk again

700
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,400
Besides, you write a program

701
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,000
You have to give me this code

702
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,800
After I finish writing, I also want to give it to others

703
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,600
OK, so what did you change at this time?

704
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,800
must also remain open

705
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,200
i want to be able to walk

706
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And I can't stipulate that he can only be exclusive to a certain

707
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
For example, a mobile phone or a tablet

708
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
then this thing must be complete

709
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And I can't restrict you to do this program with other programs

710
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I can't take a walk because of that.

711
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Your stuff still needs to be able to walk

712
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
The various ways of walking must be handled with skill

713
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
This means that both electronic files and written files should be able to walk

714
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So it's a free walk

715
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Its concept is like this

716
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Open source code means that everyone can see it

717
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
does not mean free

718
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
If you don't understand, you can still ask me to collect money for you

719
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
because I offer you my knowledge

720
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So I think openness and free are two different things

721
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
open just saying i can show you

722
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
you can also watch

723
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
You don't understand what's going on in your house

724
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Of course, after opening up, it will be a very important change.

725
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Because once it's open source

726
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
In fact, the industry is booming

727
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
This knowledge also flows quickly

728
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Of course, it is also very good for Taiwan.

729
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Because it used to be 20 years ago

730
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
The so-called operating system is a great technology

731
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Because everyone doesn't know how to write

732
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's everywhere now, isn't it?

733
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
everyone knows how to write

734
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Everyone knows how to change

735
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Of course not only operating systems have open source

736
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
There's a lot more open source

737
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Give me some examples

738
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
For example, as a window interface

739
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
or even you stay soft

740
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Some people use FarFox which is a soft gas

741
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
or even some challenges with Microsoft Office

742
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
The so-called OpenOffice

743
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
or even the database's

744
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
data transfer software

745
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
There are also so-called web servers

746
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
All kinds of things are open

747
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
There are many companies you also find that say

748
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I don't do it my way anymore

749
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
If a lot of people open source

750
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
People keep adding new things

751
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'll just take part in their calculations

752
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
if that thing does well

753
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'll use his stuff and continue to enhance it

754
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Anyway, if things are bad, someone will come in.

755
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
go ahead and fix it

756
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
certainly

757
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,200
That's what a lot of open source people are thinking about doing this

758
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,800
ok that's open source

759
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,800
of course you just say

760
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,200
In addition to the so-called open source code I just told you

761
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,800
Linux runs Android on it

762
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,000
it's all open

763
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,000
then everyone can share

764
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,300
then i can be my phone

765
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,700
ok wait

766
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,400
Of course, here is a quick summary for you.

767
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,400
what phone do i have

768
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,000
I can develop App on it

769
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,600
Of course there are some development environments

770
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
I'll probably mention it to you guys a little bit soon.

771
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,200
Android and other development environments

772
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,500
Of course, it was done in java at the beginning

773
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,900
java is a programming language

774
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,200
Later, some people made use of other development environments to do

775
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,500
Including C++, Python

776
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,000
Different open environments to do

777
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,000
There are many of these environments

778
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,000
Like I just asked you to mention this one

779
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,500
Also includes Android Studio

780
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,700
You can develop App on it

781
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,100
Can be directly developed on Windows

782
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,800
then put it on and so on

783
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,700
Well these different development environments

784
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
that many things can be done very well

785
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,600
It actually has a variety of graphical interfaces

786
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,100
you are on top

787
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,200
when developing

788
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,700
It can be done in a relatively simple way

789
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,200
OK good

790
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,800
of course

791
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
what did you look like after you finished the program

792
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,200
Let me tell you a little bit

793
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,300
OK everyone knows

794
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,600
What are the things you download from Apps

795
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,700
It's good to feel a little bit

796
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,300
Normally we who write programs

797
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,500
write my program in a programming language

798
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,800
That in Android such a

799
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,600
In an environment like Android

800
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,400
Everyone generally uses a language like Java

801
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,900
for program development

802
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,500
What about after I develop

803
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,400
Then a program

804
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,000
We generally call it a compiler

805
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,200
compile it

806
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,400
After compiling

807
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,900
will become another

808
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,200
almost executable archive

809
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,100
What about this file?

810
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,900
Java has a very special concept called

811
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,300
This BuyCode

812
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,500
We call it BuyCode

813
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,100
It appeared after it was compiled

814
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,200
The shape of this file

815
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,400
It looks like something class

816
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,300
OK

817
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,600
what's so special about this program

818
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,000
I want to report to you

819
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,200
This program is especially

820
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
where is it

821
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,400
I used to be on a certain station

822
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,400
For example, the program I wrote on the X86 machine

823
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,700
This program cannot be directly moved to

824
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,200
another company

825
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,400
For example, Motorola

826
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,500
The things done on the CPU run directly

827
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,600
Can't directly move to

828
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,800
Run directly on the CPU of the Arm company

829
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
is not possible

830
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,300
Because the cross machine cannot run

831
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,400
But where is the greatness of Jiafa?

832
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,200
it is cross platform

833
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Once I compile

834
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,000
on this machine on that machine

835
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
all can run

836
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Then why is there such a thing

837
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,400
It's actually the concept

838
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,000
on the real machine

839
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,800
ran a thing called a so-called virtual machine

840
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,000
above is running your program

841
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,200
Then your program is actually running on a virtual machine

842
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,700
And this virtual machine

843
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,700
can be placed on any machine

844
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,300
Your program goes to the place of the virtual machine

845
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,700
is safe

846
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,600
can be moved at will

847
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,400
So what if my program wants to run on another machine?

848
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,900
As long as there is a virtual machine on that machine you can run

849
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,200
so what to do

850
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,600
So it means that the app I wrote is my program

851
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,400
Whether it's made by Samsung

852
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,800
No matter it is made by HTC, it can run

853
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,800
Because what I run out of is cross-platform

854
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,600
I'm running on a virtual machine

855
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,100
so you don't worry about saying

856
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,200
What about the program on my phone?

857
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,500
It's Samsung's mobile phone with some apps running on it

858
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,600
Can I also download it on another machine

859
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,700
the answer is yes

860
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,500
Because of this so-called virtual machine concept

861
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,800
So the code is no longer bound to a certain machine

862
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,400
it can be tied

863
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,700
OK good

864
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,700
It's interesting when the concept comes out

865
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,200
OK of course

866
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,800
Before you run this program

867
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,300
Of course you have to convert it to the Android environment

868
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,500
It also has a tool called DX

869
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,500
will convert it to this

870
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,400
will do some optimization work

871
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,000
make it on your android

872
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,400
Running performance can be better

873
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,600
OK good

874
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,700
So so far, it's

875
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,600
At your

876
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,240
This is what the program running on your phone looks like

877
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,160
What do you guys download from the App Store?

878
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,040
You go to the App Store and if you make an app

879
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,640
If you want to put it on the App Store for people to download

880
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,560
Basically it does one more conversion

881
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,960
with another tool called AAPT

882
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,600
After you make a package

883
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,040
It's called the point APK program

884
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,600
So the program you downloaded in the App Store

885
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,440
Just click the APK program

886
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,600
So after downloading, it will be decompressed

887
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,200
Just put it on and run

888
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,040
That's the basic concept

889
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,600
So in this slide, I mainly want to tell you two things

890
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,480
The first thing is on the phone

891
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,400
The running app is cross-platform

892
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,680
On this machine and that machine no matter what processor you are running

893
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,760
Whether it's Motorola's

894
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,240
It doesn't matter which one of Apple's is the same, you can run

895
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,400
Because it is running on a virtual machine

896
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,680
There is also a virtual machine on top of the entity

897
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,000
and only then run your program

898
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,600
OK, so the virtual machine can be implemented on different machines

899
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,500
Your layers can then be moved on top of

900
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,100
OK of course other than that

901
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,300
I'm telling you

902
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,000
In fact, in the end, after packaging this thing, it will be on your App Store.

903
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
you can download

904
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,500
Download it, unzip it, and install it

905
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,800
OK, that layer runs on top

906
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,000
Let me tell you a few concepts

907
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What about the design of our mobile phone?

908
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,500
It's a little bit different from your current desktop computer.

909
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
What about desktop computers?

910
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,100
if you can imagine

911
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,800
Can I run many levels

912
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,500
It doesn't matter if your Office Powerpoint can be cut and cut

913
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,800
But a phone isn't like your desktop computer after all.

914
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,700
It's just something you hold in your hand

915
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,100
It doesn't have a big screen

916
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,900
You seem to only do one thing at a time

917
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,800
OK of course you can listen to music

918
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,500
Then send a message to others

919
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,900
OK can also be OK

920
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,300
But what about when you're looking at your phone?

921
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,000
Seems to be the foreground branch

922
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,100
also because of this

923
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,800
Its design concept is a little different

924
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,700
OK

925
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,800
First of all, let me just say a few names.

926
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,200
OK, then I'll tell you a little bit about

927
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,800
what its concept looks like

928
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,800
on the phone

929
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,400
What about Android phones?

930
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,000
We say a thing is called activity

931
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,200
called Activity

932
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,800
In fact it is used to display a screen

933
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,900
OK it's doing one thing

934
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,300
it interacts with our users

935
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,500
Except for the one thing that interacts with you

936
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
In fact, there is something running behind

937
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,200
OK, for example, helping you download something

938
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,100
The latter thing is generally called a service

939
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,900
it executes in the background

940
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,300
It may be downloading from the remote end

941
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,300
What about after that?

942
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,400
Activity interacts with you

943
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,000
OK at the same time

944
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,200
You have a lot of things running together on this phone

945
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,800
some material is shared

946
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,500
OK, if it has to do this thing

947
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,600
It puts some data

948
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,900
do some integration

949
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,100
combined for use by other programs

950
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,800
It is called Content Provider

951
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,200
There's still a lot of work going on on the phone.

952
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,500
Including saying that your battery is not very good

953
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,660
The phone will notify you that the battery is low

954
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,460
what are you going to do then

955
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,660
so some notifications will appear

956
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,460
Then if you write some programs on it

957
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,960
can also receive some responses from these systems

958
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,660
And some of this requirement

959
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,660
then you can do something

960
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,660
Well, if that's the case

961
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,160
Let's start to see how the mobile phone works

962
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,660
First you open something on your phone

963
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,160
The idea on the phone is this

964
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,660
there is something running activity

965
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,660
do some processing with you in front

966
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,660
Then you open another thing

967
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,660
The next thing it does is put the

968
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,160
like a stack

969
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,260
It puts this activity 2

970
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,260
Just stuff it on top of Activity 1

971
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,260
OK so you see activity 2

972
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,660
Activity 1 ran to the background below

973
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,660
What if you're driving a

974
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,860
Activity 3 just run to the top

975
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,860
so one on top of the other

976
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,860
The thing on top of it is the front neck thing

977
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,860
What's underneath is called the background

978
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,360
OK, of course you can imagine

979
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,660
there's a front neck you face it

980
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,860
bottom is behind

981
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,060
OK this is the idea of ​​the phone

982
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Because it has a small screen, do one thing at a time

983
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,840
What's on top is the foreground, what's left is the background

984
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,340
Then if you press a return key,

985
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,840
when jumping the top thing off

986
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,140
that thing it destroys you

987
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,540
Then move the back to the foreground

988
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,740
why destroy

989
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,740
In fact, this is because when mobile phones are being made

990
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,840
because of its memory etc. it's small

991
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,540
Resources are limited, so it saves what it can

992
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,440
If that thing thinks you don't look at it, it will kill you

993
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,440
But of course this is just a concept right now

994
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,440
does not mean that it will continue to do so in the future

995
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,440
But it also represents an idea of ​​the phone

996
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,040
once you look at one more thing

997
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,280
What is in front is separate from what is behind

998
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,780
it is handled differently

999
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,880
Speaking of this, I actually tell you

1000
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,880
Some ways to operate the phone

1001
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,180
I gave you some simple explanations

1002
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,580
let's see then

1003
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,120
From then till now

1004
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,820
Android development

1005
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,620
Android basically

1006
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
There are new revisions almost every year

1007
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,000
No matter how it is revised

1008
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Everyone noticed one thing

1009
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,800
Its name is just named after dim sum

1010
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,800
Like the old one called Cupcat

1011
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Until now called Marshmallow

1012
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,800
This is the October version

1013
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
So after a while there is a version

1014
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,400
all dim sum

1015
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,000
Anyway

1016
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
These versions are basically shared by mobile phones and tablets.

1017
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Except for a version like 3.0 Honeycomb

1018
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So this is its development

1019
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Everyone, the progress is actually quite fast.

1020
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
In terms of market share

1021
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,400
Everyone, the bottom one is Marshmallow

1022
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,000
Because it didn't take long, right?

1023
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,000
The more you go to the top, you will see different versions

1024
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Of course, this is a lot of words to give you a feeling.

1025
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Aggel is the time axis

1026
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
This Y axis is 100% all android

1027
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,440
For example, at this point in time

1028
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,940
This time point is from the perspective of October 2013

1029
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,940
You can see what version is used

1030
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,440
what percentage

1031
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,940
It's normal, and you see, as time goes by,

1032
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,440
A new phone will come out with a new version

1033
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
The old ones are slowly passing by

1034
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,940
When the new one first came out, the surplus rate was still very small.

1035
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,940
slowly grow up

1036
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,440
When I grow up, when time goes this way

1037
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,440
This bottom marshmallow

1038
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,440
After a while it looks like this green

1039
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,240
And new ones come out, come out from under

1040
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,240
will keep going like this

1041
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,240
This is a state we see

1042
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,240
Here's a feel for some numbers for you guys

1043
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,240
so far

1044
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,740
What is the market share of Android phones?

1045
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,040
You can see that up to now, of course

1046
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,540
marshmallow is latest 6.0

1047
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,240
it has 2.3%

1048
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,240
As you can see, many are still alive, right?

1049
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,340
Of course, the mobile phone does not mean that it will be broken after a year of use.

1050
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
many things are still alive

1051
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Look at the previous version 2.2

1052
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
There is still 0.1% share

1053
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
ok

1054
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
anyway

1055
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So everyone see Kickhand 4.3

1056
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
What about version 4.4?

1057
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Actually still

1058
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Jelly Bean is still there too

1059
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
This is a very natural process

1060
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
it will keep pushing

1061
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Occupancy rate will make some changes

1062
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
good

1063
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
then look again

1064
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
What about different smartphones?

1065
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
what is their occupancy rate like

1066
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
everyone see

1067
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Android phone on top

1068
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
current market share

1069
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
About 82%

1070
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
ok

1071
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
So 8 out of 10 phones are Android phones

1072
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
besides that

1073
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Further down is iOS

1074
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
That is to say, when you see Apple's mobile phone

1075
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
what about share

1076
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You probably see 14% now

1077
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
but it will float

1078
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
In 2014

1079
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
See in 12 to 14 in 2015

1080
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
it keeps going up and down

1081
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
What about Windows phones?

1082
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
2.8 2.5 actually

1083
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
have been unable to rush up

1084
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
About 2.3

1085
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,960
3% only

1086
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,400
What about Blackberry?

1087
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,800
going from bad to worse

1088
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,260
0.7、0.3

1089
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,460
I don't know when it will disappear

1090
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,800
By 0.3 it has almost disappeared

1091
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,960
Of course there are others

1092
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,100
don't know what it is

1093
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,660
OK

1094
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,260
good

1095
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:17,160
This is from the perspective of mobile phone distribution

1096
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,500
then this is

1097
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,460
In addition, it is the report of IDC

1098
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,060
The front is Garden's report

1099
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:26,460
OK

1100
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,460
He also told you

1101
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,860
The distribution is about the same

1102
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,460
everyone see

1103
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,560
This is XO

1104
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,920
Y axis is time

1105
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,820
This is the Y axis is the market share

1106
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,020
What about the top one?

1107
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,020
you can imagine

1108
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,620
This is the Android phone

1109
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,320
OK

1110
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,260
What about the blue one?

1111
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,020
It is an IOS mobile phone

1112
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,660
OK

1113
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,660
then further down

1114
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,220
everyone see

1115
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,420
This is other Windows

1116
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,820
Bratberry, etc.

1117
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,620
basically

1118
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,920
The surveys conducted by the two companies are similar

1119
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,220
OK

1120
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,020
Both are about 82%

1121
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,020
A market distribution of left and right

1122
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:54,820
good

1123
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,520
What about the comparison of major phones?

1124
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,620
take a quick look

1125
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,080
your IOS

1126
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,200
The Phone Windows Phone Android Phone

1127
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,700
OK

1128
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,200
is their development environment etc.

1129
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,200
market share

1130
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,000
OK

1131
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,600
What about the development environment?

1132
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,600
from different development environments

1133
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,000
from java to different

1134
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,400
OK

1135
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
Of course one is Android

1136
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,400
The bottom of Android is Linux

1137
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,600
Windows phones run Windows

1138
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,800
What about IOS?

1139
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,500
It's actually an Apple phone

1140
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,600
It actually runs the Unix operating system at the bottom

1141
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,100
OK

1142
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,900
Of course, there is Mark's operating system at the bottom

1143
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,900
It's running BSD Unix

1144
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,200
OK

1145
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,300
Then stack it like this

1146
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:31,900
OK

1147
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,000
But you can say it belongs to Unix

1148
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,900
In this way, it is actually quite accurate.

1149
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,400
good

1150
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,700
Then you say

1151
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,900
Is it only young people who use mobile phones?

1152
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,500
Actually not

1153
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,100
OK

1154
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,500
Because just now many people said

1155
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,100
Oops, we don't know how to use mobile phones anymore

1156
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:46,900
OK

1157
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,100
are used by young people

1158
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,100
Actually not

1159
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,800
OK

1160
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,500
Guys you belong to this group

1161
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:51,900
OK

1162
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,500
Of course there are many young people here

1163
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,100
OK

1164
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,200
Then take me as an example

1165
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:55,700
look

1166
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,700
I belong to the 3 40%

1167
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,100
Everyone look at this over 65 years old

1168
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
8% use mobile phones and smartphones

1169
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
20% aged 50 and over 55

1170
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
If the tablet is nearly 30%

1171
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
This number may be a little more than you think.

1172
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
besides that look again

1173
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
What is the distribution of mobile phones?

1174
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Of course, at present, Android mobile phones have 57%

1175
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
iPhone, etc.

1176
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
This has a different distribution

1177
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:35,000
This is a distribution of mobile phone and age

1178
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So we're not really special

1179
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
In fact, each of us occupies a large proportion in it.

1180
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
What about the mobile phone?

1181
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Is it just that of course we just say

1182
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So many people use mobile phones

1183
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
what was the year like

1184
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Are we Taiwanese particularly aged?

1185
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Actually not OK

1186
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Someone is worse than us OK

1187
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
let's take a look

1188
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
If you see the green part above, it is a TV

1189
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
So you said Indonesians like to watch TV

1190
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Thai people see less

1191
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
The blue part is your personal computer and your PC

1192
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
The yellow part is the mobile phone

1193
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
behind the tablet

1194
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
everyone see

1195
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
If you look at it from this point of view

1196
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
you will see some very interesting fact

1197
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
The distribution of people in different places is actually very different

1198
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Of course, you are most concerned about what about us.

1199
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
take a look everyone

1200
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Actually we are miserable

1201
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
take a look everyone

1202
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
This one still looks like a blue TV

1203
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
red is your pc

1204
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
The green one is the phone

1205
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
blue is

1206
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
sorry the purple one is your tablet

1207
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
everyone see

1208
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
The use of so many screens above

1209
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Our phone is the highest 197

1210
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
actually amazing

1211
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
So if you look at it this way

1212
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Actually we beat almost everyone

1213
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
right

1214
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,600
Since the Japanese are not our opponents, right?

1215
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,200
Indonesians are nothing to look at, right?

1216
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,100
Okay, so we look pretty good.

1217
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:08,900
OK

1218
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,800
Taiwanese people are really sticky to their phones

1219
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,200
OK good

1220
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,800
Then we are all glued to our phones, OK

1221
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,800
Actually we all know that OK

1222
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,100
Then why am I so clingy to my phone?

1223
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,900
because it can do many things

1224
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,500
So so let's take a look

1225
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,300
Why is this called a smartphone?

1226
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,600
So why is it called a smartphone?

1227
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,300
Actually there's something behind it

1228
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,200
So that's why I use this phone

1229
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,900
Because you're not using it to make calls

1230
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,000
Use it to do many things OK

1231
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,200
what things

1232
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,200
For example, the services behind you may include

1233
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,000
Management of your personal information

1234
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,900
For example, your blog

1235
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,900
your carrant

1236
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,400
all your forms

1237
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,100
You are like me, everything is online OK

1238
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,300
when you often go outside

1239
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,000
you will check

1240
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,600
Is there any good food nearby? OK

1241
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,200
You will do some location based services

1242
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,900
location-based services

1243
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,100
then you may do many other

1244
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,240
For example, all my information is uploaded to the so-called

1245
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,240
Go to Jobbox

1246
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,040
I can download it on every machine

1247
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,840
OK

1248
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,840
so you have some

1249
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,840
some so-called general services

1250
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,840
Of course there are many others

1251
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,340
Let's say you share a photo on

1252
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,640
or you read some news on it

1253
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,240
so you'll notice

1254
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,240
There's actually a lot of stuff you do on it

1255
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,440
like a blog

1256
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,240
Many people read blogs

1257
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:23,840
OK

1258
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,240
Many people spend a lot of time on it every day

1259
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,240
your form

1260
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,240
maybe you're not alone

1261
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,980
You watch alone with many people

1262
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,480
For example, say your colleagues are doing something together

1263
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,480
Everyone wants to know if you are busy now

1264
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,680
He doesn't need to call you

1265
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,980
He went directly to Google to see

1266
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,480
you just share it

1267
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,480
And of course you guys just looked at your map.

1268
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,280
OK

1269
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,780
you can find a lot of things on it

1270
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,480
Your hard drive can be placed in the cloud

1271
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,480
everyone can go up and see

1272
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,480
You can go up and use it on every machine

1273
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,280
OK

1274
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,980
And you read the news

1275
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,220
or you can share

1276
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
like your photo etc.

1277
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,280
Then why do this thing

1278
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,280
There must be something behind it to support these services

1279
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,780
Otherwise how can we get so many things

1280
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:11,980
you can imagine

1281
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:15,480
So many people put videos on their computers

1282
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,980
Where did you put it?

1283
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,480
We all know that we have gone to the cloud

1284
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,480
There's a really huge machine over there in the back

1285
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,480
it can hold almost unlimited amount of stuff

1286
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,480
you want to check anything

1287
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,980
When you hit Google to ingest something

1288
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,980
It's far away and I don't know where it is

1289
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,980
After collecting the items for you, they will be delivered to you.

1290
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,980
so what does it mean

1291
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,980
Indicates that there should be a very huge machine behind it

1292
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,980
or a bunch of machines

1293
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,980
in support of all your services

1294
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,980
To provide the blog you just saw

1295
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,980
your facebook too

1296
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,980
to do all these things

1297
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,980
So there must be a very powerful machine behind it

1298
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,980
it provides you with all these services

1299
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,980
OK

1300
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:55,980
Everyone knows that is more beautiful

1301
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,980
people on facebook now

1302
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,980
actually very very amazing

1303
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,840
This is from 2012 to 2014

1304
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,160
You see it keeps increasing every year

1305
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,160
has been increasing

1306
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,660
That number is millions

1307
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:08,760
Then you see

1308
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,760
This 1393 million

1309
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,360
what is that

1310
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,260
million trillion billion billion

1311
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,460
OK there are 1.3 billion people

1312
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,760
nearly 1.4 billion people

1313
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,160
Also use Facebook on the Internet

1314
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,360
OK so 1.4 billion people

1315
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,000
directly on top

1316
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,060
mean what

1317
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,060
It must continue to be able to carry this matter

1318
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:27,960
And what?

1319
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,620
From 2012 until 2014

1320
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,960
Until you find out all the way down

1321
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,420
it will continue to grow

1322
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,320
Because the world's population is billions of people

1323
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,120
OK it will continue to grow

1324
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,920
What about the service behind it?

1325
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,620
have to be able to keep supporting it

1326
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,620
OK what does that mean

1327
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,220
It must have a huge ecosystem behind it

1328
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,360
to push all this stuff

1329
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:48,960
OK

1330
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,420
so that our phone

1331
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,460
get all the services we want

1332
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:55,620
OK, so when you look at it from this angle

1333
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,920
then let's see

1334
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,080
what are these things

1335
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
what is

1336
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Actually

1337
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
What about the things behind this huge service?

1338
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Cloud Computing

1339
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
ok you have a huge cloud platform over there

1340
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Because why is it called cloud

1341
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
you don't know where you are, do you?

1342
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Is it right to face in the cloud anyway?

1343
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I can't see it's there

1344
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I can use what I want

1345
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
ok good

1346
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So let's define what is cloud computing

1347
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
What about cloud computing from an engineering perspective?

1348
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It basically provides a bunch of machines

1349
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
The machine is not necessarily physical

1350
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
it is virtual

1351
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Behind is thousands of machines on it

1352
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It supports all the services on it

1353
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
ok, let’s run this thing on a real machine

1354
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
ok, the machines will continue to increase

1355
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
ok, let's look at it from an engineering point of view

1356
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
What about from a business point of view?

1357
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
basically it's a thing

1358
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
there's a way there's a service for me

1359
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
it keeps growing

1360
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
ok

1361
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
And it's always there

1362
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
ok

1363
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,700
It can support very large applications

1364
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,400
Of course, what are the characteristics of cloud computing?

1365
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,900
The first his platform is virtual

1366
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,200
Where is it, you don't really care

1367
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,500
Maybe in Taiwan Maybe in Europe Maybe in America

1368
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,800
You don't mind too much, it's over there anyway.

1369
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,500
OK, what about the second one?

1370
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,100
Everything has to be able to continue to grow

1371
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,700
I want to be able to support a billion people now

1372
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,300
In the future, this set of tools must be able to support two billion people

1373
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,700
Three billion people must continue to rise

1374
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,500
All his services must be efficient

1375
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,000
unable to follow the process of growing up

1376
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,500
when I click Google to do an ingest

1377
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,500
Come back in ten minutes, no

1378
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,500
OK press it and you will be back immediately

1379
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,300
OK for all service types

1380
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,000
actually becomes very elastic

1381
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,900
when the clouds appear

1382
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,000
what is the impact on us

1383
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,900
Of course the first

1384
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:57,700
you'll find that says where do you put the pictures

1385
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,500
Well, it's in my computer.

1386
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,500
Of course there are problems

1387
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,120
I also let it go OK

1388
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,840
it's nothing to be ashamed of

1389
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,000
But where are many people

1390
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,440
I don’t know where it’s right, in the cloud, right?

1391
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,120
everyone can see

1392
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,520
Your usage behavior is starting to change

1393
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,120
Behavior Change

1394
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,400
All manufacturers are also greatly affected

1395
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,160
I can give you an example

1396
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,880
Everyone see what is the most profitable for Microsoft

1397
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,080
What is Microsoft's most profitable

1398
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,680
It's not that Windows is the most profitable Office

1399
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,440
OK

1400
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,760
It's Word's Powerpoint that makes the most money with these things

1401
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,240
But Microsoft is getting scared too

1402
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,320
Why

1403
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,400
because before

1404
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,600
Before, you were using Word and Powerpoint

1405
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,360
Do you remember

1406
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,840
You're all done editing on this one machine and it's here

1407
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,600
What do you want to do when another machine is used

1408
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,120
copy him out

1409
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,080
Get another machine and store it in

1410
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,600
Everyone recently, everyone uses Office

1411
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,520
did you find one thing

1412
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,920
You can log in with an account

1413
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,200
After you change it, it can exist on it

1414
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,000
no idea where it is

1415
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,000
If you log in on another machine, you can watch it directly

1416
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,400
So it's clouded

1417
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,800
things have gone up

1418
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,000
Why

1419
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,200
Because it actually faces the challenge of the cloud

1420
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,400
so therefore

1421
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,500
Include it app started changing

1422
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,800
It is no longer a stand-alone program

1423
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,200
Start is a cross-machine program

1424
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,100
Its service also does not allow you to modify the program on a machine

1425
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,700
Started going out across machines

1426
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,500
So this time you will find

1427
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,200
office has entered its life and death challenge

1428
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,200
Because includes OpenOffice

1429
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,700
Everyone including Google wants to do this business

1430
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,200
It's so easy to make money, it has to make money

1431
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,300
Once everything is online

1432
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,000
After no longer the same machine

1433
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:50,700
Your previous advantage may become your biggest obstacle now

1434
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,400
everyone has to go up

1435
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,400
So the nature of apps starts to change

1436
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,300
Everything starts to go to the cloud

1437
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,000
ok

1438
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,300
What about after going up?

1439
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,600
How to use it on your mobile device

1440
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,000
It also begins to discover connections with the way you use it on your desk

1441
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
OK

1442
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,200
everyone pay attention

1443
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,700
Recently, if you have used this Apple mobile phone

1444
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,000
you also noticed one thing

1445
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,500
your call to your cell phone

1446
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,500
Because your tablet can also call, right?

1447
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,500
Why

1448
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,500
Because it actually starts to connect

1449
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,300
start to link together

1450
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,200
This is an example to tell you

1451
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,500
In fact your application

1452
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,200
No longer a stand-alone application

1453
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,500
Start the network cloud thing

1454
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,000
start walking in that direction

1455
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
The concept of desktop software

1456
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,500
Further down the time has begun to cease to exist

1457
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:43,500
What started out as a decentralized web

1458
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,200
OK

1459
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,300
that's why

1460
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,100
In fact, Microsoft now

1461
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,200
So hard to make a push to the cloud part

1462
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:50,900
because

1463
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,400
the world has begun to change

1464
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,200
It's not what it used to be

1465
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,200
of course

1466
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,800
It also provides us with great opportunities

1467
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,600
OK

1468
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,840
It's like I'm telling you

1469
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,000
What about cloud computing?

1470
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
it has to be successful

1471
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,800
Of course there are several prerequisites

1472
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,400
Guys, what about after you put your photos in the cloud?

1473
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,000
you have to show others

1474
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,200
you say sorry

1475
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,200
I can't see it OK

1476
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,600
I don't know why OK

1477
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,600
you are very very depressed

1478
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,100
because one thing is put in one place

1479
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,200
you should always have it

1480
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,000
availability is very important

1481
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,200
Anytime I can use it I can see OK

1482
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,000
not only that

1483
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,500
After I put things in the cloud

1484
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,500
I'm worried about being stolen, right?

1485
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,300
i have some pictures

1486
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,900
I have some information that was blocked by my test paper

1487
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,500
I am already very happy when I go to the cloud student

1488
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,700
if he can download

1489
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,500
He has an exam tomorrow, right?

1490
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,100
so no

1491
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,500
I must lock it up OK

1492
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,500
My storage space will continue to grow OK

1493
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,900
can handle a billion people today

1494
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,500
Can handle two billion people in the future

1495
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,700
Facebook will say

1496
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,100
Sorry, I only serve you 1.3 billion people today

1497
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,100
Sorry for the new person, I won't accept it OK

1498
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,100
no way right

1499
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,500
He said try his best, try his best

1500
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,900
I can do two billion, three billion, I'm fine, right?

1501
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,100
so he doesn't move

1502
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Countable growth

1503
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,600
OK

1504
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,500
rapid growth

1505
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,800
Not only you are storing and computing

1506
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,300
all things grow

1507
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,300
Then what

1508
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,300
After everything is online

1509
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,300
you guys noticed one thing

1510
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:13,100
If you are in the company

1511
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,900
or you are in school

1512
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,900
did you notice one thing

1513
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,500
Many things are no longer available

1514
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,200
OK

1515
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,700
for example

1516
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,000
in my lab

1517
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,300
I've stopped buying some servers

1518
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,300
I rented it

1519
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,000
OK

1520
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,100
all online

1521
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:28,800
OK

1522
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,600
machine broken

1523
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,800
I hold him accountable

1524
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,600
OK

1525
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,600
Everything is on the Internet

1526
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,200
OK

1527
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,400
so my students

1528
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,200
or assistant

1529
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,400
To download any file

1530
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,600
I said go there and download it

1531
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,300
24 hours shop

1532
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,100
OK

1533
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,200
guaranteed to get

1534
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:43,600
OK

1535
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,700
die and find him responsible

1536
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,400
right

1537
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,200
Look everyone

1538
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,200
He has a license with me

1539
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,700
he rented me this thing

1540
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,700
He guarantees me 24 hours

1541
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,400
365 days a day

1542
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,400
Every second must be able to walk

1543
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,500
and fast

1544
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,800
or he pays me

1545
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,200
OK

1546
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,220
So actually notice that something is starting to change

1547
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,720
Some hardware items are not available for purchase

1548
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,220
I use pig software, can I still buy it?

1549
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,220
Of course you don't buy some software

1550
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,220
Because there are no more machines, right?

1551
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:16,720
I may just use that machine to type directly on it

1552
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,720
It's fine to pay as long as it takes to sleep.

1553
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,220
So things will change, right?

1554
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:27,120
So the new economic order of all things has gradually arrived

1555
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,640
Because many things I no longer need to acquire

1556
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,640
some things i bring with pigs

1557
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,640
I'm a pig machine, I'm a pig software

1558
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,640
I don't want it

1559
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,640
I opened a shop, why do I buy so many machines

1560
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,640
I just talk to anyone, whether it's Amazon

1561
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,140
Whether it is Chunghwa Telecom, rent this computer room

1562
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:51,140
Just go straight up and open the shop

1563
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:54,640
If you want to expand today, just rent a few more machines

1564
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,640
got bigger

1565
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,660
So you can grow up and get smaller at any time

1566
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,660
also sell us

1567
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,100
So a lot of things started to change

1568
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,900
I buy a software, I don't have to think about it for a long time

1569
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,400
I rent it for two days and use it. I don’t like returning it to him.

1570
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:12,500
Of course, many things have changed by then.

1571
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,900
In fact, the cloud drives a lot of services behind it.

1572
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,800
Cause our mobile phone has a lot of power

1573
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,900
Support turning into a smart phone

1574
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:25,600
But it is actually changing our whole world

1575
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,900
not just like that

1576
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,500
let's go on

1577
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,000
What is cloud computing

1578
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,900
When it comes to this, everyone will say

1579
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:37,100
Cloud computing is in the very deep cloud

1580
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,000
something is running

1581
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,100
I can save things, I can run data

1582
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,700
I just ask for what I want

1583
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,400
it does look like this

1584
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,300
Since there is a cloud, my things can exist on it

1585
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,900
Tell me, where is this cloud?

1586
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,800
it may not matter to you

1587
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,200
but some people care

1588
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:59,500
For example, they care about hospitals and the government.

1589
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,000
He said

1590
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,500
There is a cloud today and I put things on it

1591
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,800
Many of my important health insurance information, if I put them there

1592
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,000
Today, the United States treats it as a leak.

1593
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,800
OK, it doesn't seem to work, right?

1594
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,200
or individuals, everyone's personally identifiable information has been downloaded

1595
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,100
no way, right?

1596
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,200
So at this time, a lot of ideas came out, including what

1597
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,200
What about clouds? Some are public clouds.

1598
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,900
some are proprietary some are hybrid

1599
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,800
The government may say that I want to build a cloud

1600
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,900
This cloud is used by all government units and is private

1601
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,000
Then this Chinese Academy may also have a cloud

1602
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,000
OK then we have some things that might be more rentable

1603
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,400
We probably only use Google and the public cloud

1604
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,600
You can do a lot of things on it

1605
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,200
After cloud computing, as I just mentioned

1606
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,800
It supports a huge application that provides the use of our mobile phones

1607
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,800
But at the same time, let's look at it again, since there is a cloud

1608
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,800
There are a few well-known nouns, let me explain to you a little

1609
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,000
OK like what?

1610
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,200
Some of you have heard of cloud computing, you may have heard of the so-called

1611
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,840
So software-level services, the so-called SARS

1612
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,480
Platform-level services and so-called

1613
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:13,440
This infrastructure may be an architecture-level service

1614
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,680
So what is software-level service?

1615
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,880
Running this software is basically a service

1616
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,440
like you use Gmail

1617
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,240
that is a software

1618
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,840
where is this software running

1619
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,360
You don't really care, do you?

1620
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,680
Any machine can run

1621
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,000
Anyway, as long as you connect it, you can use it.

1622
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Well, platform-level services

1623
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,880
like these things

1624
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,240
Just like the business Microsoft does

1625
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,680
it runs a platform on it

1626
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,040
Everyone has heard of Azoo

1627
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,240
There are many development tools on it

1628
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,680
So you don't have to rent a platform

1629
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,000
There is no need to buy a database from him

1630
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,800
you just rent that thing for it

1631
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,840
You can develop things on it

1632
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,000
you can do business

1633
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,440
Or like Amazon does this business

1634
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,600
it provides these machines

1635
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,600
you can rent some machines for it

1636
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,480
you can put things on it

1637
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,400
Let me give you another example

1638
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,480
How many of you have heard of box grabbing?

1639
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,840
What is Jobbox? Everyone, is it a piece of software?

1640
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,000
After I installed this software

1641
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,720
I can move between several computers

1642
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,240
share some files, right?

1643
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,560
After all installed, it will automatically

1644
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,840
Change it here and help me sync

1645
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,760
Change it here and copy it for me

1646
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,400
It helps me keep both sides the same

1647
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,600
Then I tell Jobbox

1648
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,000
I will buy 100GB from you a year

1649
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,800
OK 100 GIGA such a space

1650
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,840
Does Amazon actually have its own machines?

1651
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,040
Sorry, does Jobbox have machines?

1652
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,400
Jobbox without machine

1653
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,240
Jobbox is rented from Amazon

1654
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,640
OK Amazon offers a lot of machines

1655
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,840
what about these machines

1656
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,640
How much CPU and how much storage space?

1657
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,240
Just rent from Jobbox

1658
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,240
Then Jobbox will be the second landlord

1659
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,440
Jobbox provides software services

1660
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,340
Then I rent with Jobbox

1661
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,640
I want to buy 100GB OK with it

1662
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,240
then i pay for it

1663
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,940
What about after Jobbox collects a lot of money?

1664
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:59,340
Rent things from Amazon for cheaper

1665
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,140
So Jobbox

1666
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
second landlord

1667
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,660
He is software service

1668
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,460
Amazon provides the machine

1669
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:07,460
he is the real landlord

1670
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,560
So everyone makes their own money layer by layer

1671
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,760
This is from the point of view of cloud computing

1672
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,660
Cloud computing is actually a huge ecosystem

1673
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:18,960
can think about it

1674
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:22,060
Some people rent machines and sell machines

1675
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,960
Just like we have a lot of people selling machines in Taiwan

1676
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,760
Give these Google stores these companies

1677
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,160
Someone is manipulating the environment

1678
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,480
Companies like Google and Amazon

1679
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,480
Let's continue to stack things on top of each other.

1680
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:37,180
So at the bottom there is provided

1681
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,380
The whole cloud structure thing

1682
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:41,380
Someone provides the platform, someone provides the software

1683
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:44,480
Someone provided the so-called solution

1684
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,880
he tells people what to do

1685
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,280
How to build a system

1686
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:50,880
So it's actually a huge ecosystem inside.

1687
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,980
supports the entire so-called cloud computing

1688
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:58,780
What do you think is the difference between cloud computing and data storage in the past?

1689
01:01:58,780 --> 01:01:59,580
very different

1690
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,900
So you used to have a data center in this place

1691
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,100
Then I have information, I'm afraid I won't see it

1692
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,700
So I use another MIRROR over there

1693
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:07,700
which side copy

1694
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:08,900
copy to copy to

1695
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,100
For fear of data loss

1696
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,100
Think about it, everyone in the cloud

1697
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,900
Is a huge data center that can grow

1698
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,400
it will keep growing by itself

1699
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,000
and it does all the backups by itself

1700
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,200
do all the management

1701
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,400
You don't have to worry about these things anymore

1702
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,700
ok of course

1703
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:29,900
In fact, how to use these services in this cloud

1704
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,300
Everyone is using it, right?

1705
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,000
like you use your phone

1706
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,500
your smartphone

1707
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,500
It's good to run all your blogs on it

1708
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,300
run your facebook

1709
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,300
In fact, they are using the service behind

1710
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,700
so what is facebook

1711
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:45,700
Facebook is the Service

1712
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:48,500
Suffer as a Service

1713
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,300
software as a service

1714
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,500
So Facebook is like Gmail

1715
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,700
it offers you a service

1716
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,700
through this thing

1717
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,000
You can get a lot of information

1718
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,100
can do with everyone

1719
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
an interaction in this community

1720
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,260
Of course, there are many other things besides mobile phones.

1721
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,400
Including everyone who sees your personal computer

1722
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,160
or even on the tv

1723
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,400
Now it is becoming more and more popular

1724
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,060
OK you can do an access to cloud data

1725
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:16,900
OK, of course the platform has many possibilities

1726
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,400
You may be Windows, you may be Android

1727
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,100
Of course you could be Apple

1728
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:26,000
OK, well, there are actually many things behind it.

1729
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
just like you mentioned

1730
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,400
We have a huge machine behind the cloud

1731
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,400
run a lot of software on it

1732
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,700
They are available from my phone

1733
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:36,900
OK good

1734
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,500
What about during this use?

1735
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,000
you probably do a lot of different things

1736
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,200
Let's say you're doing a search for something

1737
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,300
For example, if you Google, who is Guo Dawei?

1738
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,500
ok ok of course

1739
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,500
when you often ask some questions

1740
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,400
you will find that say

1741
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,400
Your stuff seems to be getting smarter

1742
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,000
OK even

1743
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,600
you guys noticed something

1744
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,200
Many of you use Gmail

1745
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,300
Then if you go to buy a plane ticket

1746
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,200
when your

1747
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
When the confirmation letter of this ticket is sent to you sometimes

1748
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
you will find one thing

1749
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,500
when you look at your this one day

1750
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,000
when you form d

1751
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
You will find that it automatically added for you

1752
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
ok then you will be scared

1753
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Why did you add something, right?

1754
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
mean what

1755
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
For example, someone is peeking at your email, right?

1756
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
That is to say, when this thing is being transmitted

1757
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Some of this system and software are already learning

1758
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Include it less than your email when sending

1759
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Or when stored on its gmail platform

1760
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
it's actually less

1761
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
it knows something

1762
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
it knows a lot about you

1763
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
then of course you should be afraid

1764
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
computer seems smart

1765
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
it knows many things about me

1766
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
How does it know so many things about me?

1767
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
There must be a great artificial intelligence behind it

1768
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
So it will learn the above material

1769
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
it will draw some conclusions

1770
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Provide you with the so-called best service

1771
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
But it also knows you best

1772
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
sounds scary

1773
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
The computer starts to learn from a large amount of data

1774
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
these things

1775
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,000
so he can make some judgments

1776
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,400
He offers you what he thinks is the best service

1777
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,400
Of course he makes the most money from you

1778
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,200
what is machine learning

1779
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,360
What about machine learning?

1780
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,960
basically a science

1781
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:19,200
He learns from a large amount of information

1782
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,960
Let's say you lose some rules to him

1783
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,000
he can judge

1784
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,600
because you're dizzy

1785
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,000
so you can't speak

1786
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,600
He said you might have had a stroke or you might have a cold

1787
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,800
or many ways of learning

1788
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,200
Not just the learning of the so-called rules

1789
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,800
even so-called directed learning

1790
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:36,800
you give him some strength

1791
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:37,960
He just makes some distinctions

1792
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,000
and then do some classification

1793
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,000
Then he starts to study

1794
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,160
know something

1795
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,760
Or give him information and he will start to distinguish

1796
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,560
Or say you give him some cases

1797
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,720
he learned

1798
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,320
so there are different techniques

1799
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,160
doing so-called machine learning

1800
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:54,720
From this information he can gain new knowledge

1801
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,360
so he can make some judgments

1802
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,080
He also knows what to look for

1803
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,760
Well, of course, in this day and age

1804
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,960
In fact, because of the entire cloud technology

1805
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,760
Also due to the generation of large amounts of data

1806
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,800
We use above

1807
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,660
So another huge opportunity arose

1808
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:14,260
It's not just cloud computing that's a huge opportunity

1809
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,000
OK phone?

1810
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,560
Cloud computing is a huge opportunity

1811
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:21,000
This whole thing keeps going

1812
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,160
In fact, there is another huge opportunity

1813
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,960
data science

1814
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,960
When you have so much data on it

1815
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,920
if you study it hard

1816
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,920
you will learn a lot

1817
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,760
OK, what about the amount of data?

1818
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,320
grow very, very energetic

1819
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,220
everybody knows

1820
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:38,420
OK various information

1821
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,820
There are many types

1822
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:41,720
OK, some information is right and wrong

1823
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:42,220
you don't know

1824
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,320
Some might be fake anyway

1825
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,960
some really are in there anyway

1826
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,120
OK so much information

1827
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,620
In fact, you start analyzing

1828
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:49,520
can start learning

1829
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,720
can do many things

1830
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,220
e.g. e-commerce

1831
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:53,020
After a period of time

1832
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:54,920
He knows what Guo Dawei likes to buy

1833
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,520
OK at night

1834
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:58,280
what should he sell

1835
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,680
OK that

1836
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
When is the time to sell him what?

1837
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,500
Because of his family, which of his family members might buy those things?

1838
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,500
He tried to sell you

1839
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,500
The same goes for medical care, with so many case files

1840
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,000
he started to analyze

1841
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,700
He said that Asians may be more prone to some diseases

1842
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,800
What might happen if you take some medicine

1843
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,500
So a lot of stuff started coming out

1844
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,500
when manufacturing

1845
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,800
I thought I had so many production materials

1846
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,300
I can do analysis

1847
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,100
For example, I can learn from many processes

1848
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:31,600
something went wrong i can do image processing

1849
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:35,400
See if there are any flaws in the things that are said to be made

1850
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,100
I can see without human eyes

1851
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,100
It will be scanned automatically after a while

1852
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,600
this thing may be broken

1853
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,100
Then you come to make further judgments

1854
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,600
social network life science

1855
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:48,600
So new big opportunities start to appear

1856
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:52,100
Of course this is nothing

1857
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,600
Nothing compares to the fact that through all the computers

1858
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,100
through all internet

1859
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:00,100
Through all these apps and your phone

1860
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,700
We're actually creating a gigantic machine

1861
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,800
OK this huge machine is

1862
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,800
Including you and me we form a huge machine

1863
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,600
What do you do when you don't know many things

1864
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,400
Go online and ask, there is always someone who knows, right?

1865
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,900
gather everyone's wisdom

1866
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,700
thus becoming a gigantic machine

1867
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:21,600
This machine is made up of people and all the machine software

1868
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,100
OK this is a

1869
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:26,100
I'm afraid it's the biggest machine in the world.

1870
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,300
OK is made of all of us

1871
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:29,700
OK good

1872
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,900
After that there are these great

1873
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:36,900
These attractive these so-called this

1874
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:39,300
Be it data science or cloud computing

1875
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,500
Great smartphone too

1876
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,000
is the world so good

1877
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,500
Actually it's not, right?

1878
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,800
The world is getting scarier, right?

1879
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,400
He's not the only one who knows me too well

1880
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,500
And things including mine are too easy to get lost

1881
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,800
Right, like I mentioned to you guys

1882
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,800
Is your cellphone safe

1883
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,200
wake up a little in the morning

1884
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,400
What to do if your phone won't turn on

1885
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
If one day I mention to you

1886
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
You need to check Guo Dawei's phone number

1887
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Wow, the address book is gone

1888
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
My photos from the past 20 years have disappeared

1889
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
what to do

1890
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
phone is not safe

1891
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
You don't think your phone is safe

1892
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
like your pc

1893
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
it is not safe

1894
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
There are all kinds of malicious programs running on it

1895
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
and more and more

1896
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Everyone said, would it be safer for me to use a mobile phone from a certain manufacturer?

1897
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
won't

1898
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Anyway, some people are using it, and some people want to destroy it.

1899
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
so there must be

1900
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
so what happens

1901
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
on your computer, it happens on your phone

1902
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Someone will collect your sensitive information

1903
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
it will hack your phone

1904
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
like hacking a computer

1905
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
What about the phone? Some malicious programs?

1906
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
will draw your personal information

1907
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
even make phone calls for you, right?

1908
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Let you send text messages to friends you haven't seen for a long time

1909
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,600
that it exists in a different way

1910
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,800
it could be some code way

1911
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,800
It is possible to go to the edge of the net to view a web page

1912
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,200
Just like you go online with a computer, you will be poisoned

1913
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,400
OK so this thing will happen

1914
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,600
like your pc

1915
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,600
Your phone will have these too

1916
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,800
For example, something like a worm

1917
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,200
This bug-like software

1918
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,600
It basically takes pictures on your phone

1919
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,800
it just keeps on copying

1920
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,800
Find a way to run to another phone

1921
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,200
Its purpose is not to steal your stuff

1922
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,600
just run on it

1923
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,600
In fact, it makes it happy

1924
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,600
But your phone is getting slower and slower

1925
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,800
Because there are still some bugs running on it

1926
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,600
because it also runs the shake time

1927
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,400
so slow you down

1928
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,400
more than that

1929
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:49,200
Many people will steal your personal information

1930
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:52,000
or even pawn your computer

1931
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,200
collect your information

1932
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,000
Or send you an advertisement if you have nothing to do

1933
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,600
still can't press

1934
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,600
So all sorts of things are showing up

1935
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Agents refer to these malicious programs that collect your sensitive data

1936
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:07,000
What he said is your Trojan horse program

1937
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,720
just run into your place

1938
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,500
Then remotely control your mobile phone

1939
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,760
Of course it's the so-called milkworm

1940
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,560
Just in the back, just walking

1941
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,500
all these things

1942
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:21,800
Or like you guys on a normal computer

1943
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:22,760
There is a so-called cookie bar

1944
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,260
Everyone knows that when you use a browser to view something

1945
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,500
Sometimes when you switch to different pages

1946
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,800
he knows you're still yours

1947
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,800
why does he know it's you

1948
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,500
Because he wrote in some materials they sent

1949
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,900
Where the data is placed is placed in the so-called cookie

1950
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,800
Since cookies can be placed in cookies

1951
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,500
can steal from the cookie, right?

1952
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,600
so what about these things

1953
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,900
Cookie refers to some data stored in the browser

1954
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,800
let the site send something

1955
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,300
Of course there are a lot of personal information in it.

1956
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,800
Actually he could steal it

1957
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,100
OK so a lot of things to steal

1958
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,600
OK everybody say

1959
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,800
that is a personal computer but

1960
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:57,800
Everyone is not

1961
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,300
this was a while ago

1962
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,560
done a collection of data

1963
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,100
Of course it's okay for you to drink a bit

1964
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:09,460
You see, in 2014 alone, there were already 650,000 malicious layers

1965
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:10,500
a lot right?

1966
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,800
Everyone, of course don't guess

1967
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,100
Don't doubt that there is more now

1968
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:18,960
Well, everyone, these malicious levels have been installed many times.

1969
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,480
it's just that you don't know

1970
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,300
We need some way to help us analyze

1971
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,580
help us interpret

1972
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:27,140
can help us troubleshoot these problems

1973
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:29,700
So we need some powerful way

1974
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:31,240
come to analyze

1975
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:34,060
And the current attack is not like the previous attack

1976
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,600
right on your phone

1977
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,660
where it may attack you from several points together

1978
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:41,220
or from here to overweight far overweight

1979
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:44,040
Let's attack your phone or your system together

1980
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,840
So your analysis also won't be analyzed on the same machine

1981
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,900
You will collect a lot of information on the Internet

1982
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,940
look where it's coming from

1983
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:52,740
then you have to defend your job

1984
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:55,560
If this is knocked out, it must be able to make up for it.

1985
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:59,140
So this thing becomes more and more complicated

1986
01:12:59,140 --> 01:12:59,940
What do you say

1987
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,800
It's the rest of the world's business not mine

1988
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,900
Ladies and gentlemen, let me report to you that Taiwan is actually very dangerous.

1989
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:09,900
This is the whole world they do a ranking

1990
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:13,900
Which telecom operators are the worst?

1991
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:16,900
OK everyone, the second place is Chunghwa Telecom

1992
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:20,400
OK ok it's 2013 of course we hope he improves

1993
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:24,400
OK, but actually, let me show you one more

1994
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,400
There is another miserable thing, you said that the problem of Chunghwa Telecom does not dare us to try

1995
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:32,000
Guys, this is another one, this is another survey

1996
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,500
In fact, comment control is that he manipulates your computer remotely

1997
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,000
OK, of course it means that your computer has been hacked.

1998
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,500
Sorry, we are number two in the world OK

1999
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,500
Well, of course it's great.

2000
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:48,500
Ours is not only the top, we are the top three OK

2001
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:51,500
Well Taiwan is a very interesting environment

2002
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,500
Everyone come over here and play it OK

2003
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,800
So it's actually very, very dangerous OK

2004
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,900
All of our stuff is constantly being infected and attacked.

2005
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
ok then of course i have so far

2006
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
What did I tell you?

2007
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I'll talk to you about the phone

2008
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
like i told you guys

2009
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
cell phone is actually

2010
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
it represents a world

2011
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
just like

2012
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Of course the mobile phone is very important, right?

2013
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I saw a while ago

2014
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I saw one two days ago

2015
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
a report on tv

2016
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Even he speaks on the Internet

2017
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
He said if your girlfriend

2018
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
fell into the water with your phone

2019
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Please save the water first

2020
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Many people will think a little bit

2021
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Then of course you're in trouble, right?

2022
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
It will be bad if your girlfriend finds out about you

2023
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
but what does it mean

2024
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
The mobile phone is really inseparable from it, right?

2025
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
think about it

2026
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
In fact, we just mentioned

2027
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
mobile phone

2028
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
It actually brings us to a

2029
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
something special

2030
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
it's not a phone anymore

2031
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
it's a smart phone

2032
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
it represents a huge ecosystem

2033
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
behind the cloud

2034
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Provide various services

2035
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
and through this phone

2036
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
have seen the whole world

2037
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Of course my phone is not safe

2038
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
In this process, there are actually many new

2039
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,260
ice opportunity presents itself

2040
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:02,960
whatever on your phone

2041
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,160
or somewhere else

2042
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,720
In fact, the world behind

2043
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,160
bigger than your phone

2044
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,820
there are clouds behind you

2045
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:10,460
you have all kinds of services

2046
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:12,160
you have different scientific operations

2047
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,220
in the whole back

2048
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:14,820
They actually form a

2049
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:17,160
a huge ecosystem on top

2050
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,560
of course

2051
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,820
everyone knows

2052
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:22,060
his whole thing

2053
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,660
won't stop at this point

2054
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:26,560
In fact, we will soon be in the context of the next era

2055
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,760
That is the so-called new era of interconnectedness

2056
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:33,080
A new era where everything is connected

2057
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,780
We all know the Internet of Things

2058
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:39,280
everything has to be connected

2059
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,120
including your mobile device

2060
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,580
unfortunately including your car

2061
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:46,780
include your building

2062
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:50,280
All sorts of things all strung together

2063
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,380
I can't see this word anymore

2064
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:55,820
Soon they estimated 50 B Company

2065
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:58,380
50 billion things

2066
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:00,000
to break again

2067
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,140
I can't see it now

2068
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:03,840
all connected

2069
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,500
everything is connected

2070
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,500
The car is going up too

2071
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,800
Of course, no one will doubt this matter.

2072
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,300
right

2073
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:13,800
Because in fact, there have been many reports about this matter.

2074
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:19,000
When the machine is in the next fifth generation of 5G computer

2075
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,200
In fact, what we have to deal with is the network that the machine is connected to.

2076
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:26,000
So the amount of data generated by machines will start to surpass

2077
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,500
The amount of data people are using to communicate

2078
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
In 5G, it is actually one of the important goals.

2079
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,500
Of course these things have a purpose

2080
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,900
Why we need IoT

2081
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,000
need these things

2082
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
In fact, a very important purpose is that we

2083
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
longing for a smart life

2084
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,200
We have a smart environment

2085
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:51,500
We can have a good one control at home

2086
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:54,500
The air conditioner was already on when you got home

2087
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,900
when you walk too close to the tv

2088
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,400
I want you to stand back a little

2089
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,100
OK

2090
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,100
then you get in the car

2091
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
In the car, you just tell him

2092
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,300
I want to go to Academia Sinica

2093
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:04,800
Hey, then drive to Academia Sinica

2094
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:05,800
ok

2095
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,800
Hey, it sounds like

2096
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,800
very far away

2097
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,800
In fact it's getting closer

2098
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,300
ok everyone will see

2099
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,300
Google's self-driving car

2100
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,300
Apple spends a lot of money

2101
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,800
everybody is doing these things

2102
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,600
Something has begun to creep in on your new

2103
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,200
started appearing in the car

2104
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,200
What is included

2105
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,100
i forgot which year

2106
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:26,200
The report says 2018

2107
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,600
He said that Toyota can do many cars

2108
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,200
so-called distance-controlled collision avoidance

2109
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:31,900
ok

2110
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:34,900
So he's already started going in that direction.

2111
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:38,300
Your car has already started to go in the direction of intelligence

2112
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:40,700
Soon your car might be like a cell phone

2113
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:41,600
ok

2114
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,800
that's not all

2115
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,400
Do many people use these

2116
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,200
so-called this

2117
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,700
wearable device

2118
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:48,900
measure your sales

2119
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,800
ok know how much you walked today

2120
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:51,500
ok

2121
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,600
of course

2122
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,900
not just selling wave

2123
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:55,000
still look at your heartbeat

2124
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,800
ah many many others

2125
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:57,800
ok you today

2126
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,000
Can help you do a lot of statistics

2127
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,500
analyze

2128
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:01,400
OK

2129
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,900
So what about wearables?

2130
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,600
will appear in large numbers

2131
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,200
Now, everyone only sees the watch

2132
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,500
And this wrist device on your hand

2133
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,000
But soon a lot of things will come in

2134
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:14,000
including with

2135
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,700
It has something to do with your life support

2136
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,500
what's inside you

2137
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,200
what you wear

2138
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,400
These things will start to appear one after another.

2139
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,100
OK

2140
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:27,400
So actually we're starting to usher in a new era

2141
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,700
But of course you all know

2142
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,000
Everyone has seen this photo, right?

2143
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,000
Everyone's waiting for something but everyone's looking at their phone

2144
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:35,500
right

2145
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,600
It seems that you have seen similar photos, right?

2146
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,600
Everyone got this job, got this job

2147
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:40,800
after this MRT

2148
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,200
Is it like this for everyone?

2149
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,100
OK

2150
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:44,500
including myself too, right?

2151
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,300
everyone is skating

2152
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,100
OK

2153
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,600
The family seems to be slipping while sitting at the dining table

2154
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:49,400
OK

2155
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:50,300
That

2156
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,500
Fewer people talking in restaurants

2157
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,200
OK everyone is typing

2158
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,800
OK, tell people how delicious my food is, take Zhang Xiang and give it away, right?

2159
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,300
Well, actually, we already have a new time.

2160
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
this habit

2161
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,820
And the kid seems to be starting to skateboard too.

2162
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:08,060
OK, a lot of things have changed, right?

2163
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:11,200
The car is also starting to be connected to the Internet, and it will be here soon

2164
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,480
Is your TV not the same as before?

2165
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,500
your smart tv this show you watch

2166
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,540
It seems that it is not only local programs

2167
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:22,280
In fact, our new habit

2168
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:25,000
have begun to emerge in our time

2169
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:28,300
Or even when I was a child, or what you imagine

2170
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:31,340
It's actually not the same in the next era.

2171
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:34,160
how do you talk to each other

2172
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,300
how do you use something

2173
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:38,500
In fact, it's not the same. OK

2174
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,100
So actually what I'm going to say is

2175
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,500
Mobile phones are not just mobile phones.

2176
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,800
Mobile phones are our window to the world

2177
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,700
OK let's go through it

2178
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,200
see a lot of new things

2179
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,700
And the whole story isn't just about the phone.

2180
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:56,100
Cloud from behind Service from behind

2181
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:59,900
The so-called science of data, the whole of it

2182
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,520
underpins an idea of ​​what we call the smartphone

2183
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:07,200
So through mobile phones and other communication devices?

2184
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,120
I'm like I just mentioned to you guys

2185
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,280
In fact, we humans have formed a

2186
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,160
a huge new machine

2187
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:16,640
We have new and different ways to share our knowledge

2188
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,920
We also have an unprecedented way of communicating

2189
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,080
you now in some way

2190
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:25,080
you can put your thoughts in no time

2191
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,160
soon maybe take a walk to africa

2192
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,440
was not possible before

2193
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,200
Now everything is chained together

2194
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:32,480
as if everyone is always saying

2195
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,080
how many times do you jump

2196
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,280
say six times you can

2197
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:38,360
Can meet everyone in the world

2198
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,480
this was not possible before

2199
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,800
Of course you say

2200
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,200
can i resist this thing

2201
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,920
Let me tell you, don't resist

2202
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:49,440
give you a few examples

2203
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,320
Recall everyone

2204
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,920
The great things that have happened in the past fifty years

2205
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,520
personal computer

2206
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:59,520
personal computer

2207
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,160
appeared about forty or fifty years ago

2208
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,240
what did the advent of the personal computer create

2209
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,560
It was called IBM PC and so on, which appeared at the beginning

2210
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,160
Of course, it also created our IT industry in Taiwan.

2211
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,200
OK

2212
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,600
Of course, you can also say the other way around, who misses this opportunity?

2213
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,560
Then the Internet

2214
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,040
The so-called Internet of physics begins to appear

2215
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,640
Of course it makes a huge difference

2216
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,560
then you ask who is hurting on this

2217
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,200
After the beginning of the so-called Internet

2218
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,040
How many people still write letters?

2219
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:36,640
few people write letters anymore

2220
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,760
Send email to everyone

2221
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:38,360
OK

2222
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,360
ok so start changing

2223
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,920
Then came the so-called WallWideWeb

2224
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,640
The so-called HTTP

2225
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,800
I can get the data started by

2226
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,400
Web page started sending

2227
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:51,360
OK

2228
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,400
You start to think about what has changed

2229
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,360
so-called browser

2230
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:57,360
OK

2231
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,760
How do you share your data?

2232
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
has changed

2233
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
you no longer use your stuff

2234
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
pass it on or copy it to others

2235
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,500
Once on this so-called portal site

2236
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,000
Immediately all went out for a walk

2237
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
people who didn't keep up

2238
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
It's like night training is right

2239
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
when searches start coming up

2240
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Who caught up and who didn't catch up

2241
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
created the emergence of Google and other companies

2242
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Then mobile devices started showing up

2243
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
There are many companies that have not caught up

2244
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
thus lagging behind, say, Intel

2245
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,000
In this, it has lost a lot to companies like Arm

2246
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Why because he doesn't know about this huge change

2247
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
his past great success

2248
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
become a huge hindrance to him now

2249
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Clouds start to appear

2250
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Of course we can guess

2251
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Now this company is like Google, Amazon

2252
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
The company is up

2253
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Which companies will start to cloud weak

2254
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
So actually what I'm going to say is

2255
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
This era is actually moving forward

2256
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
keep going

2257
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Then we may not be able to resist it

2258
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
But we can put it to good use

2259
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Then we must welcome the era where everything is connected

2260
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
this is my hope

2261
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
one day if i could wear it

2262
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
such an internet of things

2263
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
such a device

2264
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
this is what i want most

2265
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
But I don't know if I can wait

2266
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Finally I thank the slideshow

2267
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
many people offer me some help

2268
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Including Professor Huang Yanlan

2269
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Professor Hong Shao

2270
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Professor Luo Wenfeng

2271
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Professor Huo Bicheng

2272
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Professor Zhang Yuanhao

2273
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
And Dr. Yang Chuanyue

2274
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Professor Zhang Zhewei

2275
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
with Professor Huang Bojun

2276
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
I'll report it here

2277
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
thank you all

2278
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
thank you very much

2279
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I have benefited a lot

2280
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I believe that everyone here has also benefited a lot.

2281
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
do you want to take a break or

2282
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
it doesn't matter

2283
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Okay, let's see if there is anything else we need to ask

2284
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
please

2285
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Hello, what I mentioned in the speech just now is

2286
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
data science or so-called data scientists

2287
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
As far as my own understanding is

2288
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,000
I think he should also be classified as a basic subject

2289
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
The foundation grows Betal Size

2290
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
It should still be about how to use these basic disciplines

2291
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
So what I want to ask is to tell you what you think

2292
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
What do you think a so-called data scientist

2293
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
What basic disciplines did he use

2294
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Then how does he use it

2295
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
or what proportion to use the knowledge of these subjects

2296
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Then he compared our current existing traditional fields

2297
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
such as physical chemistry psychology

2298
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Or what is the difference between a mathematician and a statistician?

2299
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Thanks

2300
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Okay, thank you

2301
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Data Science is actually a very

2302
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
sex name ok

2303
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Represents a group of things

2304
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,500
What about data science?

2305
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:06,000
In fact, it itself is a cross-field thing

2306
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
when i talk about data science

2307
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
the question you should ask me is where is it used

2308
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,500
ok if you use it in the so-called manufacturing

2309
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:18,500
At this time, the experts on the manufacturing side must come in together

2310
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:21,000
ok then when you ask me

2311
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Is this data science applied in medical treatment?

2312
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,500
The medical experts have to come in together.

2313
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,000
then you will notice

2314
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,500
What is included in data science?

2315
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,000
That is to say, analyzing these data

2316
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,000
These scientists who sorted out these capabilities

2317
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:42,500
In addition, there are also experts in the application direction of certain fields

2318
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,000
after putting it together

2319
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:49,000
to produce truly useful data science

2320
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,500
So so overall

2321
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,000
In fact, if we look at it academically

2322
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,500
In fact, it will be composed from different angles

2323
01:25:56,500 --> 01:26:00,000
There are some words from this information project

2324
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
such expertise comes in

2325
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Of course, it's not just data analysis.

2326
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,000
or materials for learning such techniques

2327
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
If data analysis Data learning techniques

2328
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Much of it is in computer science

2329
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
There is a part of this following technique

2330
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
is on mathematics

2331
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
there's a lot of knowledge about that

2332
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
In fact, in different application directions

2333
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
OK so that's about all I can say

2334
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Thank you teacher for your wonderful speech

2335
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Since we are talking about wisdom

2336
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Speaking of the largest machine

2337
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Speaking of Sharing

2338
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Then such words

2339
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
What are the places where people can't be replaced?

2340
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
any thoughts on this

2341
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
can share with us

2342
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Thanks

2343
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
good

2344
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
that's an interesting question

2345
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
If the machine is so powerful

2346
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Then what should we humans play?

2347
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
what kind of role

2348
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:02,200
OK good

2349
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:05,300
Fortunately, there are still many roles to play.

2350
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,000
OK

2351
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:07,400
But you can imagine

2352
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,500
There are a lot of characters starting to disappear

2353
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,900
Can you tell me which characters have disappeared now?

2354
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,400
You've noticed that some jobs in the bank are starting to disappear.

2355
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,900
You often use ATM machines

2356
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,400
you are not very expensive

2357
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:23,000
Some people are not very smart to do some materials

2358
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:24,600
Do account processing

2359
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
OK the way you buy a ticket has changed

2360
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:31,300
Some parts of the semantic set are starting to disappear

2361
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:32,100
OK

2362
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:36,100
But there are many creative directions

2363
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,700
Or new jobs are starting to emerge

2364
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,900
So what I'm going to say is

2365
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,600
indeed in the process

2366
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,700
The computer starts to treat some of us

2367
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:47,500
regular

2368
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:49,400
simplified work

2369
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,200
jobs that can be easily analyzed

2370
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:54,500
Structured work begins to displace

2371
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,400
But it is actually to some extent

2372
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,500
It also creates something new

2373
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,400
then of course you can talk

2374
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,440
Are the jobs created

2375
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:07,480
$ less than the jobs that are currently disappearing

2376
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,440
currently in many ways yes

2377
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:10,440
OK

2378
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:11,520
you can see

2379
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,520
Today I have automation

2380
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:17,880
In fact, many jobs in factories are starting to disappear.

2381
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:19,360
because I can automate

2382
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:23,560
And it's actually more efficient doing something

2383
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:25,560
but you will find

2384
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:26,560
many things

2385
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,560
you still have to ask someone to do it

2386
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:29,560
OK

2387
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,560
For example, I mentioned to you

2388
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,560
let me give you an example

2389
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,560
Let's say I want to design something

2390
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,560
like a cup

2391
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:37,560
these grips

2392
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:38,560
all these things

2393
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,560
In fact, many things are still done by people.

2394
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:41,560
what about the computer

2395
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:44,560
In fact, far from the wisdom of real people

2396
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,560
There is still a big gap

2397
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,560
Of course we think it's great

2398
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:49,560
but it's still far

2399
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:50,560
OK

2400
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,560
let me give you an example

2401
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,560
Now everyone is always talking

2402
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,560
I'm from a photo

2403
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,560
I hope to be able to identify

2404
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,560
is there a cat in it

2405
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,360
or is there a dog laughing in it

2406
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:03,360
OK

2407
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:06,400
Well guys it's very easy for each of us

2408
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,800
As soon as you see it, you'll know if anyone is in there this time.

2409
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,560
You can tell if he's laughing or crying, right?

2410
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:14,000
But it is very difficult for a computer

2411
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:14,800
OK

2412
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,400
Although many people still do some so-called Deep Learning technologies

2413
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:22,000
Deep Learning These technologies are basically the last two stages

2414
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,800
The first stage is a bit like the so-called Filtering stage

2415
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:29,000
Just how to abstract the data inside and extract it

2416
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
turn it into something else

2417
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Then do the comparison

2418
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Let's see if the answer is

2419
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,400
So in the process you will find it very interesting that is to say

2420
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:42,600
Now you will find that there are some research findings that say

2421
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,000
It seems to work. I don’t know why.

2422
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,600
so what i want to say is

2423
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:51,200
As simple as that, is there a dog smiling in a photo?

2424
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,200
It's hard for a computer

2425
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:56,000
It's very simple for us humans

2426
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
OK so I'm back to these questions

2427
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
we are inside

2428
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,420
There will always be many, many roles in it

2429
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:05,380
It's just that we'll find out

2430
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:08,140
We'll become a complementary character with him

2431
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:10,140
an interactive character

2432
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:12,100
more and more like this

2433
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:14,780
so many things will disappear

2434
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:17,080
But there are many things that will be born

2435
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:20,400
that's how i feel

2436
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:27,140
Hello Professor Guo

2437
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:29,140
I feel very rewarded today

2438
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:31,240
thank you for a great day

2439
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,160
My name is Lin Yuxuan

2440
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,460
own background as a psychiatrist

2441
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:38,160
Also an amateur mobile app developer

2442
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:40,740
So I would like to ask Professor Guo two questions

2443
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:42,860
One is from the perspective of a psychiatrist

2444
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:45,380
The other is asking from a mobile development perspective

2445
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:48,540
That Nature is the journal of nature

2446
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:51,980
There was a report of a cause two weeks ago

2447
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:54,220
Reports say that all

2448
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:56,840
mental health

2449
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:59,220
All apps for psychiatry

2450
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Call Pocket Spirit to make

2451
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,500
Pocket Psychiatrist

2452
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:04,500
then i believe

2453
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,500
I think what the professor just said is very correct

2454
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:09,000
Which means the phone has completely changed

2455
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,500
our new way of life

2456
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,000
Then I think the phone does

2457
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
His new technology also changed

2458
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,500
human psychology and behavior

2459
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,000
then i want to ask

2460
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
If it is from the perspective of teaching you

2461
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
and your point of view

2462
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
user experience and user interface

2463
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Research in the process of mobile app development

2464
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
heavy or not

2465
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,500
This is the first question

2466
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,500
Because human behavior may be changing all the time

2467
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,500
The second is to say

2468
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:37,000
The main content just taught

2469
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,500
Is introducing some architecture of Android

2470
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:42,500
That Android it from this 4.1 4.2

2471
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:43,500
There is a big breakthrough

2472
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,500
and now to 6.0

2473
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,500
Then what we have been more worried about is that

2474
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:50,000
Because of my doctoral dissertation in the past

2475
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,500
It is a service to write the background of the cell-phone

2476
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,500
to detect some human behavior

2477
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,000
Then we actually all have a worry

2478
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Worried that Android is in

2479
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
while it's progressing it will look like

2480
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,720
The iOS system may put many parts of the background

2481
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,440
get it out of our reach

2482
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,440
Then I want to ask the professor to read this

2483
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,320
A process of Android's development

2484
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,160
Yes, because now it's like the professor said

2485
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,600
In fact, the protection of information security is very important

2486
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,760
I don't know what the professor thinks about this safety

2487
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:19,160
There is also a disease that develops between the two

2488
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:21,200
ok let me answer the first question first

2489
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:24,400
That is to say, a study of the user interface

2490
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,200
It's definitely very important OK

2491
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,360
Now everyone's most criticized

2492
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:29,640
For example, a mobile phone is also good

2493
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,640
or wearing a taxi or your watch

2494
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:34,200
OK, everyone thinks why the watch consumes so much power

2495
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,400
You bring your smartwatch now

2496
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:36,640
why so much power consumption

2497
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:38,560
Because the way it does it is like a mobile phone

2498
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,840
It's what a computer's mind does

2499
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:43,040
the same phone

2500
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,440
you somehow see it

2501
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:46,840
It's doing it in a bit of an ultra-PC way

2502
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,640
OK everyone often says

2503
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,440
what you see on your pc right now

2504
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:52,560
Might be on the phone in a while

2505
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:55,040
OK so what I'm going to say is

2506
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,440
Actually this is wrong OK

2507
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:00,440
We go from A to B like this

2508
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,400
it's really fast

2509
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,800
but it's basically

2510
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,000
The logic of thinking is different

2511
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,800
Because how people use mobile phones

2512
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,400
It is different from using a computer

2513
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,600
Not to mention how people use watches

2514
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,200
It's completely different from using a computer

2515
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,500
Let me give you an example

2516
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,000
your watch keeps moving

2517
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,800
I think many people have used this smart watch

2518
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,200
It's not very useful

2519
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,200
I have several of my own and I'm fine

2520
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:27,000
Because I am doing related research myself, I am using

2521
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,400
its interface is difficult to use

2522
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,400
Then I'll find something to slide around

2523
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,400
Sometimes I can't find what I want

2524
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,400
Of course the phone is the same

2525
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:38,800
But the phone will be better

2526
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,400
It's at least slightly closer to your computer

2527
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,400
So what I'm going to say is

2528
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,400
personal use

2529
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:47,400
get used to it

2530
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:52,000
Must be able to reflect the design of your computer

2531
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Not only in the design of the interface

2532
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,800
and including its operation

2533
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,400
must be done like this

2534
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,000
say your watch

2535
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
if you don't pick it up

2536
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Actually why do so many things

2537
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Wouldn't it be better if you just timed it?

2538
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
There are actually things to do when you pick it up

2539
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
ok so our

2540
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
the way of using the habit of using

2541
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Of course the system should do this

2542
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Unfortunately that's not the case now

2543
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
ok, why does the phone consume so much power

2544
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Why Smartwatch Your iWatch

2545
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Charge every two days

2546
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
because it's not right

2547
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
ok, the future is actually this direction

2548
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Everyone is thinking about how to do new things

2549
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Especially when it comes to the Internet of Things, it should not be done like this

2550
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
when you go to the doctor

2551
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Maybe I'll take a bracelet home with me later

2552
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
when will you see the doctor next time

2553
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
maybe a month from now

2554
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
maybe half a year later

2555
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
correct can't run out of power

2556
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
you go home and ask everyone to take it back

2557
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Take it off and charge it

2558
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Many people don't know how to charge, right?

2559
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
best time to go

2560
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
The doctor took a look

2561
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
give you another one

2562
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
By the way, put the information in

2563
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
ok, what can last half a year

2564
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Our current watch will never need to change the battery for a lifetime

2565
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
not dead yet, right?

2566
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
You think what I'm going to say is right

2567
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Now many designs are problematic

2568
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,000
So this user interface follows the user's habits

2569
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
real implementation

2570
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
TALK APP IN DESIGN ON YOUR PHONE

2571
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
WATCH WEAR ARE ABOVE EVERYTHING

2572
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
that's right

2573
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,000
OK this is my first question I think

2574
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
The second question is actually to say

2575
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,000
This phone is actually in the process of glasses

2576
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
only many things it will appear

2577
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
some things will disappear ok

2578
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Then I want to talk about the first thing is to say

2579
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
You see the idea of ​​Android design

2580
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
At the bottom of it is an operating system

2581
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
A so-called intermediary software is made above

2582
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
It is the FriendWalk layer

2583
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
why does it do this

2584
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,000
In fact, its purpose is to pull everyone in.

2585
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Many things can be placed on this layer

2586
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
A field stuff comes in

2587
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
it made hardware

2588
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
it has something to put here

2589
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Come in on field B

2590
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
it comes in it stuff can go here

2591
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,680
So he wrapped everyone in this thing

2592
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:05,180
OK, so everyone is roleplaying

2593
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:08,380
OK let's build this whole ecosystem together

2594
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:12,080
OK, so the first thing that comes up

2595
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,980
The basic idea is to hope that everyone can play together

2596
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:19,140
OK, so of course what if in the process?

2597
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:21,060
Actually there is no way to avoid it

2598
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:23,560
A lot of things will leak out because of this.

2599
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:25,740
because everyone knows what it looks like

2600
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:28,500
OK, let's go back and say

2601
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:31,160
What about data protection? OK

2602
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,800
Data Protection is Now in the Cloud Era

2603
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:36,000
Everyone's most painful question

2604
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,340
You all know I went online and searched for that thing

2605
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:40,040
or after accidentally putting something on it

2606
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:42,040
I bake shellfish all over the place, right?

2607
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:43,300
Really can't finish killing, right?

2608
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,540
I don’t know where the Cache went, right?

2609
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:46,940
Google also keeps several copies

2610
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:47,800
I don't know how to get rid of it

2611
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:50,400
You still told him if you could kill me for me, right?

2612
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:51,600
that's it

2613
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,760
So actually

2614
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:56,360
Now everyone is starting to think about this question OK

2615
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:58,520
Not just encrypting and decrypting data

2616
01:36:58,520 --> 01:36:59,980
how can it be

2617
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,360
It's easy to permanently erase your data

2618
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:03,360
ok

2619
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,860
So this is the next important job

2620
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:07,860
This work may not be possible by

2621
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:10,360
or not just should be used by android like this

2622
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:12,860
such an institution

2623
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:15,360
Or such a platform to do

2624
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:16,860
ok this is actually

2625
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:18,860
problems everyone has

2626
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:19,860
will deal with

2627
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:21,860
Does he have something permanent

2628
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:23,360
don't show us

2629
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:24,360
ok

2630
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:26,360
My current experience is

2631
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:27,360
not so much

2632
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,360
ok

2633
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:30,360
ourselves on top

2634
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:32,360
Modified a lot of things

2635
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:33,860
did a lot of research

2636
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:35,860
In fact, we can still see

2637
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:36,860
ok

2638
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:38,860
Generally no big problem

2639
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:40,860
but what is the biggest problem

2640
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:42,860
the biggest problem is

2641
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:44,860
Today, for example, a manufacturer

2642
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:45,860
ok

2643
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:48,860
He does, for example, image processing

2644
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:49,860
ok

2645
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:51,860
so he has something

2646
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:53,860
he will get involved

2647
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:56,860
Modification of some things in the structure

2648
01:37:56,860 --> 01:37:59,360
then you are scary

2649
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,760
It is not easy for him to understand this

2650
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,160
how did it move

2651
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:03,800
ok

2652
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,400
He doesn't want to talk to you

2653
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,600
So even if that thing is over there

2654
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,160
Actually I don't understand

2655
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:10,800
ok

2656
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:11,720
This is a

2657
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:12,960
when we do it ourselves

2658
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,600
a problem to face

2659
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:15,800
still have a question

2660
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:16,720
that is

2661
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:17,400
everything today

2662
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:19,320
Although open source

2663
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:21,800
But this guard against gentlemen is not against villains

2664
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:22,400
ok

2665
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:23,320
That is to say

2666
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:24,880
I made this thing

2667
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,600
I will open source though

2668
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:27,800
show everyone

2669
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,720
I can be half a year late

2670
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:31,440
I'll give it to you later

2671
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,840
procrastinating

2672
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:33,560
ok

2673
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:35,920
You can't get the latest version if you want to get something

2674
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:36,520
ok

2675
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:39,120
like these soft hard ways

2676
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:40,720
we all have some degree

2677
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:41,480
Come

2678
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:42,160
Come

2679
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:43,040
Delay

2680
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,720
get this thing out

2681
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:46,600
But what?

2682
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,680
In terms of openness

2683
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:49,480
exist

2684
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:50,680
on android

2685
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:53,240
We haven't had too many problems

2686
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:54,040
ok

2687
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,040
big problem

2688
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,840
In fact, it should be in

2689
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,120
this other compare

2690
01:38:59,120 --> 01:38:59,920
mid-walled

2691
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,280
make a system inside

2692
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:02,820
Those things are less available

2693
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:09,100
ask the director what to do

2694
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:11,520
Prevent VIP Groups

2695
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,280
when we use that computer

2696
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,100
For mobile phones all the time

2697
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:15,880
thank you all

2698
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:17,400
The best way is to copy

2699
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:18,180
ensure safety

2700
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:18,940
copy

2701
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:20,220
copy things

2702
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:21,760
then hide it

2703
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:22,280
OK

2704
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:23,800
this is the best way

2705
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,340
because i'm serious

2706
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:27,900
Because everything can be hacked

2707
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:28,920
OK

2708
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:33,020
The only thing that can't be broken is that you put the copy in your luggage

2709
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:33,520
OK

2710
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:38,400
I'm not kidding

2711
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:39,940
like my own practice is

2712
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:42,480
I copied it to the hard drive after a while

2713
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,800
I put it away if it's important

2714
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:45,820
OK

2715
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:46,580
That

2716
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:47,860
people can't get it

2717
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:48,380
OK

2718
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,720
Be sure to install antivirus software.

2719
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:53,240
OK

2720
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:57,340
Thank you, teacher

2721
01:39:57,340 --> 01:39:58,360
I have a

2722
01:39:58,360 --> 01:39:59,960
doubt gold

2723
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Now data science is actually quite popular, and there are many opportunities

2724
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Compared with this service fee, there is no boundary between people

2725
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
And always filled with more sprites

2726
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
But compared to the other part of the feeling

2727
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Even on the opposite side of Xianxue, there may be some threats

2728
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Have these threats slowly turned into trends?

2729
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:28,000
It may even subvert the current ecology in the future

2730
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Have you ever thought about which of these things may have a better chance of affecting our entire life?

2731
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Now this eCos etc.

2732
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:45,000
In fact, you just mentioned this and immediately thought of the safety mentioned by the doctor just now.

2733
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Security can be disrupted

2734
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Somewhat subversive cloud computing

2735
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Because you are afraid of leaking a lot of information.

2736
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:00,000
After you put it on, if something is not safe, you are very scared

2737
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,600
At this time, it will affect everyone to use the shared storage space

2738
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:07,440
So everyone feels unsafe

2739
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:08,440
the first point

2740
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:09,740
Second point

2741
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:12,040
I give an example

2742
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:14,840
like myself using this search engine

2743
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:17,400
Or when using the so-called browser

2744
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:20,480
In fact, you also said that I have a bit of this

2745
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:21,760
paranoia of persecution

2746
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:22,280
OK

2747
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:24,060
I have several browsers

2748
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:26,880
Actually, I don't always use one

2749
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:28,920
sometimes

2750
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:33,260
Use Firefox sometimes Chrome I sometimes use IE when I'm happy

2751
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:34,800
because

2752
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:36,860
I don't want people to know too much

2753
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:39,420
why do i tell him so many things

2754
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:40,440
OK

2755
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,260
Are you afraid that someone is watching you from behind?

2756
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:46,840
When Google Knows Everything

2757
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:48,880
he can sell you too

2758
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:50,160
OK

2759
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:52,220
After he can analyze it one day

2760
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:55,040
Tell you like the Minority Report

2761
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:56,320
ah you

2762
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,340
what might happen

2763
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
OK can you?

2764
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
He knows you're dangerous after too many things

2765
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,000
OK he knows the water in your house is water

2766
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
OK, I know where you're flying to today

2767
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Can he guarantee that your information will not be stolen by others?

2768
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
It's actually hard

2769
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Very difficult

2770
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
OK so I think

2771
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
When you ask this question, my first thought is safety

2772
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
OK Data Security

2773
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
my second thought was

2774
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
I don't want a Big Brother watching me from behind

2775
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
he knows everything ok

2776
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Sometimes it's hard to think about

2777
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Although he can't do anything

2778
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I'm not afraid of him knowing

2779
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
but weird

2780
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,000
I'm afraid he knows everything

2781
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I immediately thought of these two things

2782
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
This may cause some problems for our cloud computing

2783
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Of course you can look at it from another angle

2784
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
For example, cloud computing

2785
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Would you say it's good for Taiwan?

2786
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
yet another question

2787
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
OK

2788
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,720
You say we sell machines

2789
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:03,600
We used to sell a lot of machines

2790
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,320
Everybody sell us machines

2791
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:06,800
Now many people don't sell us machines

2792
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,320
he rents the machine

2793
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,360
Are our machines sold less

2794
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:11,280
OK

2795
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,320
so you can look at it from different angles

2796
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:15,560
Actually, is it good for us?

2797
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:17,120
in this process

2798
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:18,800
Actually we also lost

2799
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,600
quite a lot

2800
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:21,960
in this wave

2801
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:25,400
what did we catch

2802
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:26,720
Of course it's worth it

2803
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:29,040
look at it from another angle

2804
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:32,200
what the hell is going on

2805
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:33,960
I may not have fully answered your question

2806
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:35,760
But the first thing to think about is safety

2807
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,960
It's not safe and I don't want to put things on it

2808
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:44,760
hello thank you for your wonderful speech

2809
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:45,560
Speaking of Information Security

2810
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:46,440
it must be said

2811
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,360
Actually this time Apple

2812
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:50,240
impossible to open it that

2813
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:51,840
World of Terrorist Attacks

2814
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,400
Of course it can take a long time

2815
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,760
i want to ask

2816
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:58,440
You develop a research scholar's perspective on a hierarchy system

2817
01:43:58,440 --> 01:43:59,960
how do you look at this problem

2818
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:05,000
From our point of view

2819
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,000
If we have a way we want to break see

2820
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Let's see if we can do it

2821
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
This of course means

2822
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
From the point of view of a researcher

2823
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Of course we would like to know about this

2824
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:23,000
If you look at it from the perspective of providing a platform

2825
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Then do you feel that it is safe for you to use his system?

2826
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
But of course it's like what you said

2827
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
there's a lot to debate

2828
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Should a manufacturer do this?

2829
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
I think this may have a lot of views

2830
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,000
That's actually from my own

2831
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,000
From my own research point of view

2832
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
I actually often want to know

2833
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Did this manufacturer leave a back door?

2834
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
after he left the back door

2835
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
He can do many great things

2836
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
i don't like what he does

2837
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
OK

2838
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
I would also guess that

2839
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,500
Later he said he could

2840
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:04,000
I knew he had a back door

2841
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
OK

2842
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Well of course there aren't many here

2843
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
I think of many things myself

2844
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
OK

2845
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
but

2846
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
basically i think

2847
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
from this

2848
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Apple he refuses to help with this

2849
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
FBI

2850
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
From the point of view of doing this

2851
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000
actually

2852
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
from our system

2853
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
From a development point of view

2854
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
actually i think

2855
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:28,000
many things can be broken

2856
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
OK

2857
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
but do you know

2858
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
how to break it

2859
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
as if you have seen

2860
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Turin this movie

2861
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
oh ron fishing

2862
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
during World War II

2863
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Break the German code

2864
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,000
It stands to reason that the encryption cannot be broken.

2865
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
but why broke

2866
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
because he knows some rules

2867
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
every time he was in the german army

2868
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,000
when someone is delivering something

2869
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I sent some words on it before

2870
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
so he knows

2871
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
relationship with that thing

2872
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,000
He because of this relationship

2873
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
He cracks what's behind

2874
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,620
So something theoretically unsolvable

2875
01:46:02,620 --> 01:46:04,960
In fact, it is actually solvable

2876
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:08,120
Back to this phone from Apple

2877
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:11,120
In fact, there are some secrets inside if you know

2878
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,620
Why can't it be broken?

2879
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:13,420
must be broken

2880
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:16,220
just didn't know it had some secrets in it

2881
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:17,620
How does it do?

2882
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:19,420
so everything can break

2883
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:20,120
i think

2884
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:21,920
As long as things made by people can be broken

2885
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:24,420
It's just that I don't know the secret

2886
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:29,140
Ask Mr. Guo

2887
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:33,340
Just mentioned Taiwan and information companies

2888
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:39,740
It's not as good as before the bright moon in the world

2889
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:41,540
So what is the main reason?

2890
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:43,840
So what do you think is the solution?

2891
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,840
Thanks

2892
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:47,840
Actually, I'm not in charge of security.

2893
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:49,840
I saw this and I thought

2894
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:52,340
Wow how we are so honorable OK

2895
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:56,760
we are actually one

2896
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:59,260
A good place to do information security research

2897
01:46:59,260 --> 01:46:59,760
OK

2898
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:06,500
It's not just that there are many people on the other side wanting to hack our website

2899
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:07,500
OK

2900
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:10,500
Naturally, another big issue is

2901
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:13,000
In fact, in our environment

2902
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,500
In fact, everyone doesn't pay much attention to law and order.

2903
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:17,000
i ask a question

2904
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,500
How many people have anti-virus software installed on their mobile phones

2905
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:21,000
Have it

2906
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
don't feel bad

2907
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Because I didn't even pretend to be OK

2908
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,500
In fact, many of us don't pay much attention to it.

2909
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,000
OK so I think it has something to do with our culture too

2910
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:37,000
OK, it has something to do with our special environment

2911
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:41,000
OK, so it’s easy for everyone to take us as a springboard to work on it

2912
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
OK so this is

2913
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
This is what we have to be careful about

2914
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Like I said, I talked about it for a long time, whether I am safe or not, I am not safe either

2915
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
It's Teacher Guo

2916
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
yes

2917
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Mr. Guo

2918
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
i want to ask

2919
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
i want to ask

2920
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,200
Google the company

2921
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:02,300
because I think it's a

2922
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:04,000
That is a lot of companies

2923
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,200
every company

2924
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:05,800
Google

2925
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:06,200
OK

2926
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:06,500
Google

2927
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:08,200
because when i knew him

2928
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:11,400
is that his Google community is very strong

2929
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:12,400
then we started to feel

2930
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:13,600
Gmail works great

2931
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,100
then follow him to

2932
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:16,100
When I start using Gmail

2933
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:19,500
He started rolling out Google Maps

2934
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:21,300
Then his map is very powerful

2935
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:22,500
then that time

2936
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:23,400
almost the same

2937
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:24,100
Self-Fone

2938
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:25,200
social system

2939
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,200
when starting to upgrade

2940
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:28,700
Then it later became a plus operating system

2941
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:30,600
Then hit the Microsoft

2942
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,700
Just because when he was PC was the beginning

2943
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:33,800
Sample reduction

2944
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:34,600
and now

2945
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:37,700
I found out that he started a business as a stationery car

2946
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:38,500
that feeling says

2947
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:39,400
he is a very

2948
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:40,100
many oriented companies

2949
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:41,600
Because he is not like other

2950
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,300
How Intel

2951
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:43,000
he wants other companies

2952
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,500
Just focus on doing this thing

2953
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:46,600
And then and he's basically this

2954
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:47,300
he is in this generation

2955
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:48,200
and our information engineering

2956
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:49,500
is a big change

2957
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:51,100
whole society

2958
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:53,100
talk to us some what way

2959
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:54,100
That

2960
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:55,000
i never get it

2961
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,100
what is he like

2962
01:48:58,100 --> 01:48:58,800
company of

2963
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,000
Why did he so early

2964
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,860
Swipe ink to make a map

2965
01:49:01,860 --> 01:49:05,860
And how do you think he will change our lives in the future?

2966
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:08,000
OK thank you

2967
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,100
Actually I don't know many things

2968
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:12,900
If you know I'm rich too, OK

2969
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:15,300
Actually, to be honest, it's true.

2970
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:17,300
When I first saw Google Map

2971
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:19,200
Actually, I didn't realize it at first

2972
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:21,000
So many things can be done on it

2973
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,500
including you can do this

2974
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:26,900
Include your search in this region

2975
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:28,500
restaurant, many things

2976
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:32,700
There is no way, I immediately think of a lot of work OK

2977
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:37,000
What about when he has a map in his hands and starts navigating?

2978
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,400
Actually didn't think of it

2979
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:41,600
At that time, it didn't occur to me that he was going to get a car.

2980
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:42,700
OK

2981
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:44,400
So this thing is actually

2982
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:47,700
I think these companies are actually very powerful.

2983
01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:50,700
Because these companies can actually guide

2984
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:53,100
it can provide great creativity

2985
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:54,400
This is actually

2986
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:57,100
i want to be like everyone

2987
01:49:57,100 --> 01:50:00,200
It is also observed that there are several very special companies

2988
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Not just Google but companies like Amazon

2989
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Or you have seen several

2990
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Including companies like Tesla

2991
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,000
In fact, they are all shaping and changing our world

2992
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Without companies like Google

2993
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
In fact, Cloud computing will not be what it is now

2994
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,000
If there were no companies like Amazon

2995
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
In fact, there are many things that are good for shopping

2996
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Or even these so-called platforms rent these

2997
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
won't go to these places

2998
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Of course you can also say that the time has just come

2999
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
But their process of leading the world and bringing these ideas

3000
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
It's actually pretty amazing

3001
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
I find it amazing

3002
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Then what do you say you will go when you come down?

3003
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
In fact, of course you all know that

3004
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Coming down must be towards this very soon

3005
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Everyone, when you see the car, it must appear immediately.

3006
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
That wearable thing is also emerging

3007
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,000
these things will change soon

3008
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Of course there are many things that will come out

3009
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,360
So the robot stuff is pretty fast I guess

3010
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:03,460
these things are very fast

3011
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:06,260
You see Google spends a lot of money doing this stuff

3012
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:08,460
His demo robot last time was actually very powerful

3013
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:12,960
The robot can actually be in such an unstable state

3014
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,260
can walk

3015
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:16,760
that was difficult

3016
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:18,160
that was very difficult

3017
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:22,860
Walking on snow is actually far south of walking on such ground

3018
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:24,360
it's very difficult

3019
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:28,660
So I don't really know what else he's going to do.

3020
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:31,660
If so, you tell me I've bought his stock

3021
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:33,820
Thanks

3022
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:36,920
Director Guo here

3023
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:38,520
i ask two questions

3024
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:40,360
The first is safety and the other is economy

3025
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:42,860
In fact, many safe places are over-proportioned.

3026
01:51:42,860 --> 01:51:47,520
In fact, for example, technology has brought many good things

3027
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,360
I am doing information myself.

3028
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,220
From MapFriend to Mobile

3029
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:53,820
There may be fewer mobile phones in the future

3030
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:56,020
attached to the body attached to the body

3031
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:59,080
One scene is simply your ID authentication is your ears

3032
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:00,080
your face

3033
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,400
you can use it as a certification

3034
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:03,800
The presence of mobile phones is sometimes even more

3035
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:05,840
will gradually decrease

3036
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:07,240
This time an area actually

3037
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:08,800
security fact

3038
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:11,200
There are two levels of security we're talking about

3039
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:12,480
a national level

3040
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,280
a personal level

3041
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:17,480
In fact, most of you now are at the national level

3042
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:21,080
That's because we have worked hard for many years

3043
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:22,720
For example, IP Oracle

3044
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:23,920
its database

3045
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:25,000
charge you a lot of money

3046
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,880
We pay Microsoft every day

3047
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,000
Now that Free Software comes out

3048
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:30,720
Of course you are cheaper

3049
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:31,760
In fact we are being tried

3050
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:32,440
they are landlords

3051
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:33,240
we are computers

3052
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:34,880
Write software on it every day

3053
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:36,320
That day Free Software came out

3054
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:39,160
The other landlord came out again

3055
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:42,360
then what i want to say is

3056
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:45,880
Actually the thing to say is something like

3057
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:47,080
after it comes out

3058
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:51,880
The certified part of its NXRP

3059
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:53,680
Its entire mechanism has been disengaged

3060
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:56,200
Credit Mechanism of Visit Master

3061
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:57,920
Part of its front NXRP

3062
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:59,880
It's another mechanism

3063
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Therefore, our credit basis will be based on the credit basis of payment in the future.

3064
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Built in the CCP's database

3065
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,000
So your safety I'll give you another example is to say

3066
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:18,000
In fact, tens of millions of dollars are stolen from our bank every year during the Chinese New Year. Everyone doesn’t know.

3067
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Then put it on to deal with it, and everyone will cover it

3068
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:27,000
So every day in a safe and unsafe environment, you can actually make backups

3069
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,000
People steal things you want to see, you can definitely see them

3070
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
It's just whether he's driving to see, so it's a matter of safety.

3071
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Considering so much when someone steals information like yours from our Dao Ke

3072
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Or how to cheat, many technologies will be damaged

3073
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:45,000
I must say that when this original list comes out, it will hurt him

3074
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,000
But he has a part, some people do anti-virus, and some people

3075
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
For example, in terms of anti-virus, maybe he is the one who releases poison, so it is 360 degrees

3076
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
We used above, for example, he made Lag or something

3077
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,000
So there is a good side and a bad side

3078
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,840
I really talked about some V numbers, just like I watch VR and AR

3079
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:05,840
It seems to be the same as the power storage

3080
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,840
So, I think personal safety is still

3081
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:11,840
Some people do it safely while others do it unsafely

3082
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,340
Both will change

3083
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:17,340
So you may be afraid of too many things and become love instead

3084
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:19,340
Like our own information security

3085
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:21,340
America doesn't speak that many words yet

3086
01:54:21,340 --> 01:54:24,340
When you go to Taiwan, you have to ask questions about what to say.

3087
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:26,340
Ask three passwords for everything

3088
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:28,340
I said my home address

3089
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:31,340
It's sign 116

3090
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:32,340
That's a T

3091
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:34,340
All questions annoy him

3092
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:36,340
A lot of information security has been overdone

3093
01:54:36,340 --> 01:54:38,340
People want to see your things and want to harm your things

3094
01:54:38,340 --> 01:54:40,340
Didn't say I can't get it

3095
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:42,340
It's just too late for him to make a move

3096
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:44,340
I want to talk about safety or something

3097
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:46,340
I talk about economic issues

3098
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:50,340
In fact, Ma Yun's problem has brought

3099
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:52,340
He sucks 450 billion a day

3100
01:54:52,340 --> 01:54:54,340
He should be able to cope with it in six months

3101
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:56,340
The whole world is sucking him away

3102
01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:59,340
Ma Yun is a wolf who offered soldiers and said he was a disaster

3103
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,960
OK, the Chinese Communist Party is also guarding against it now.

3104
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:07,800
In fact, it has brought about 30% to 50% of the bank

3105
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,400
Will not exist in the future will be dumped

3106
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:11,840
The bank is not that big in the office

3107
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:13,160
blow air conditioner a lot of sailors

3108
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:14,720
it will become a small office

3109
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:17,280
So what I'm going to talk about is

3110
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:20,200
A lot of manpower is released

3111
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:23,640
Last year, the channel brought about one million stores in mainland China

3112
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:26,080
Not on the big market, on the middle market

3113
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:29,400
So the problem in the future is a polarized problem

3114
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:31,760
rich people are rich

3115
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:33,000
no money is no money

3116
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,640
So from twenty two you can have

3117
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:36,600
There are so many careers to find a job

3118
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:38,240
Almost everything below is doing building work

3119
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:40,040
The middle is all braked

3120
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:41,280
Replace all three words

3121
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:43,160
Whether traffic braking

3122
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:45,280
Foley Brake Chemicals

3123
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,400
almost no one is there

3124
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:49,640
Then the economic problem at this time

3125
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:53,280
There is a problem of decoupling from the currency

3126
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:54,400
that capital is rich

3127
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:56,320
For example, today I met a

3128
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:59,280
For example, today we do venture capital

3129
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,160
I haven't had a day

3130
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,360
There are 20 households losing 5 million each

3131
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:04,720
I am the major shareholder of each

3132
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:06,640
Then account for those VC

3133
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:08,640
What is the bed Startup Brainpower

3134
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:11,520
The start-up is working under the account

3135
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:13,360
Then he always takes the most money

3136
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:15,760
Therefore, in the future, the relationship between the United States and the CCP

3137
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:18,240
They have money and shout more at the top

3138
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:21,760
I think we have a problem with the problem

3139
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:22,880
In fact, it means

3140
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:25,600
The economy will bring about the next

3141
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:27,360
The next phase of the revolution

3142
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:28,560
what's your opinion

3143
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:30,560
Because in fact too many careers

3144
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:32,400
Too many poor people are enslaved

3145
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:33,280
Two phases

3146
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:36,400
This time the power of the times is actually a rebound

3147
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:39,280
Then this must be an economic issue

3148
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:40,880
more dangerous

3149
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:41,760
Thanks

3150
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:42,560
Thanks

3151
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:43,920
I think indeed

3152
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:45,360
this new economic era

3153
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:47,520
New technology will definitely bring about new changes

3154
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:48,400
This is for sure

3155
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:49,040
ok

3156
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:50,080
What about the process?

3157
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:51,920
In fact, as we just mentioned

3158
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,120
something will disappear

3159
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,240
some will appear

3160
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:55,280
ok

3161
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:57,120
that as

3162
01:56:57,120 --> 01:57:00,480
From the perspective of this research

3163
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,600
or from an educational point of view

3164
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:04,000
In fact, we have to get used to these things very quickly.

3165
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,400
know what the future might hold

3166
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:06,900
OK

3167
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:09,400
How can we bring our students

3168
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:11,400
And bring to our society the public

3169
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:12,600
what a warning

3170
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:15,200
or what should be done in research

3171
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:17,400
I think it's hard to do

3172
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:17,900
OK

3173
01:57:17,900 --> 01:57:20,100
And this thing is international now

3174
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:22,200
The problem is actually very, very complicated

3175
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:23,300
I also agree

3176
01:57:23,300 --> 01:57:25,600
In fact, you can't be afraid of everything

3177
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:28,600
If you say you want to be completely 100% safe

3178
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:29,600
It is actually difficult

3179
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:32,600
It is always a principle of proportion

3180
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:33,600
where can it be done

3181
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:34,800
you think it's ok

3182
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,300
where should it be done

3183
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:39,800
Some places may adopt a more conservative approach

3184
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:41,500
some places may compare

3185
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:42,200
the money

3186
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,300
This compares to the previous one

3187
01:57:44,300 --> 01:57:46,300
Don't think about these things compare this

3188
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:47,100
can't talk about money

3189
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:49,700
It's basically a way of pushing forward

3190
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:51,800
In fact, there are different strategies in it.

3191
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:53,300
so i agree

3192
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:55,200
There is a consideration like

3193
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:56,500
good

3194
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:58,000
I think it's almost time

3195
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,800
Thank you so much today

3196
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
My master's wonderful speech
