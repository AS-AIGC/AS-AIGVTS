00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:25,180

00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:31,080
Academia Sinica's Knowledge Experience in August Kebo Lectures and Speeches Begin

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,880
We invite Vice President Huang Jingxin to host for us

5
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:39,080
【applause】

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,880
First of all, on behalf of Academia Sinica, welcome all distinguished guests

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,280
Well, today is Professor Ying Qingsun's lecture

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,380
So this is also a speech he gave before he retired.

9
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,180
But don't worry, he didn't just retire

10
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,280
He will retire in 2021

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,080
so i just

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,680
I was also very nervous just now, such an important scholar is going to retire soon

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,680
I'm not ready yet

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,520
I am in charge of major research in the humanities and social sciences

15
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,020
So I'm right about this

16
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,760
Special care for the dynamics of our outstanding academics

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,340
then let me introduce

18
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,840
Shadow Youth Professor

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,320
Maybe some people think of him as a very herdsman

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,820
know him well

21
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,320
But I still have to be reasonable

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,480
say a few words

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,980
Professor Naying Youth

24
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,620

lecture professor meaning

30
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,760

major in family sociology

32
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,560

The growth history of Taiwanese teenagers, etc.

46
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,800
his scholarly works

Academic Issues of Feminist

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What about today, Professor Ying Qingchun?

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
will explain to us that there is a hospital

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
A long-term research project driven by society

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
is from 2000

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Continue to track the progress of Guoyi and Guoshan

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
teen growth trajectory

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
so we have someone here

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Those in the investigation have become adults

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the young man's child

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This long-term follow-up

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The Growth Process of Taiwanese Teenagers

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and social context research

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Attempt to explore family education from it

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
interaction with society

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and the difficulty of constructing localized research

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It is hoped that the results of the study

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Proposed to influence the youth of the society

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Important Factors in the Growth Process

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,440
His speech must be wonderful

72
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,640
Let's applaud Dr. Ying

73
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Thanks

74
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
you are the one, aren't you?

75
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,980
you have to stand

76
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,140
It doesn't matter if you can sit here

77
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,220
Standing like this

78
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
open it first

79
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,960
Thank you Vice President Huang

80
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,960
It's really an honor to have the opportunity to represent the research group

81
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Come share our research results with you

82
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,600
Last time at this place was June 2010

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,400
At that time, the first phase of our follow-up study

84
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,640
just came to an end

85
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,040
so i'm joking

86
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,140
Our humanities and social sciences seem to have to be taught every 10 years

87
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,880
So I probably won't have time to report the update to you next year

88
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,800
So when I was preparing this speech myself,

89
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,480
I am very grateful

90
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,000
then later

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,840
Because I really want to share such rich results with you.

92
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,120
hang again

93
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,680
So I keep changing the powerpoint to 6:10

94
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,960
so now what

95
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,240
I try my best to speak

96
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,280
Please cheer up everyone

97
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,340
I speak faster and faster

98
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,360
that's

99
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,440
I will try my best to make everyone understand

100
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,960
especially i'm glad to know

101
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,520
Some of the respondents to our straight talk in-depth interviews

102
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,560
here today

103
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,840
i don't know where you are

104
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,120
but hope you know

105
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,200
Your academic contribution is very great

106
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,960
Thanks

107
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,480
good

108
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,520
give me this

109
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,320
where do i press

110
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,160
good

111
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,200
Simply put, before starting

112
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,240
I want to represent

113
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,640
Our research group is mainly composed of sociologists and social psychologists

114
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
So

115
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,960
what our research cares

116
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,040
I said that we are often more concerned about structural factors

117
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,600
Personal factors are also important

118
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,640
But we may be more concerned with structural factors

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,500
People like to see some short-term effects

120
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,800
We pay more attention to some long-term effects

121
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,900
in addition

122
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,000
cultural norms

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,400
Great influence on people

124
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,100
Or personal education income, etc.

125
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,300
How high is this personal resource?

126
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,200
Then these influences

127
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,800
There are also some data for our reference

128
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,200
I simply use an example to illustrate

129
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,400
I think maybe everyone will understand

130
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,400
We all know that divorce research is very important

131
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Probably the world has

132
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,300
More than thousands of academic research reports

133
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,100
Most divorce studies are

134
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,400
Focus on the reasons for divorce between husband and wife

135
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,500
Then tell you that the relationship is not good

136
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,900
Because they have different money levels, etc.

137
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,100
this is very important

138
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,800
However, sociological research is more concerned with structural factors

139
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,400
That is to say, when the husband and wife are two people

140
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,100
As soon as it is shown, the difference in education level is greater

141
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,900
The greater the difference in financial background between the two growth backgrounds

142
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,100
or his whole body

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The greater the difference in life experience, the greater the difference in these structural experiences

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The probability of his divorce has increased significantly

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So let's say it again, what we're going to say later

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
All findings do not refer to a single person

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Rather, it is a pattern that is pronounced across the majority

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So there are always some surprises

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
These journalism scholars are very interested

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
To report these special circumstances

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We want to know too, but we want to know more

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
what most people look like

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But I just said that we are right about the structural factors

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Because Huang Fu is here

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There's nothing we can do when we meet historians

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Because, our...

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
like that divorce study tells us

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
when the country is at war

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That divorce rate is soaring

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Fortunately , wars don't happen every day

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That is the structural factor at least exists

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
probably like this

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
In today's report, I will probably focus on the first two aspects.

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Because it's a...

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,440
Long-term research, especially with many colleagues among us and our sample

166
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,840
I will explain the whole research plan to you.

167
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,920
Then I try to succinctly divide the findings of our research into three parts

168
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:21,000
In terms of family, in terms of education, in terms of marriage and childbearing in this generation

169
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,320
I am very grateful that this project over the years is mainly from the Academia Sinica Theme Research Project

170
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,120
There is also support from the Ministry of Science and Technology, the former National Science Council, and social institutes.

171
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,120
Fine fee support can only continue until now

172
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,760
Our research team, this is the second phase

173
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,720
In the first stage, there are some professors such as Fuyang Zhi who have participated in the

174
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,280
I made this Star sign because I was a postdoctoral fellow in this project

175
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,760
For example, Fan Ganghua, associate professor of Soochow University, is on it

176
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,480
And these are now assistant professors

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
There are different ranks and different schools

178
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Simply put, TYP

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I call simplicity TYP, it studies the master

180
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
can be divided into three

181
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
one is that we want to know

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The growth trajectory of contemporary young people

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We are definitely not the first research team in Taiwan

184
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
do this topic

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
New Women Scholars

186
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
they put a lot of emphasis on some development

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
They may go from elementary school to junior high school

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Or from middle school to high school

189
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
i know on the biological side

190
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
There are also many people doing his fertility development

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But we are from the perspective of social science

192
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Especially sociology and family studies orientation

193
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
go see this thing

194
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The second schedule of our positioning

195
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
from a life course perspective

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
from early teens

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
traced all the way to his young adulthood

198
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So it goes through several important life stages

199
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The third

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Of course we want to see

201
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Indigenous development model

202
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,320
The vast majority of members were educated in the United States

203
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,520
So for the study of American adolescents

204
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,560
Their biggest priority is probably nothing more than drug use.

205
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,840
with sex

206
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,600
But then we kept thinking

207
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,040
our middle school kids

208
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,520
Is this his main life focus

209
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,720
It does not seem

210
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,480
So in the last study

211
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,080
I will specifically report to you

212
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,800
Stress cram school results for students and more

213
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,440
Actually that's what they really are

214
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,280
second way of life

215
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,600
Then we also hope that in the end we can

216
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,880
Influence of social and cultural norms seen in multiple growth trajectories

217
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,320
So this is what I will say quickly about these three one by one.

218
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,480
The growth trajectory of young people

219
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,960
Have social context, cultural norms, and life experience

220
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,280
We have been fortunate to have

221
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,120
just in the whole from

222
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,920
From collectivism to individualism

223
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,320
Intergenerational values ​​and attitudes

224
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,400
We hear it all over the place

225
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,920
So we just use a scientific evidence to see

226
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,040
what is he

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,000
In this stage, from 13 years old to 32 years old, there are school diversion and job stratification

228
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Then does the young man want to live with his parents, and does he continue to live with his parents after he gets married?

229
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Then when will he leave home? Are there any regional differences? Are there resource considerations?

230
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
More importantly, we noticed that when we started, we said we were going to design a scale called parental control of children.

231
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
At that time, the professor of the University of California proposed the concept and there was no scale, so how do you talk about management?

232
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
As a result, I didn’t expect our channel to follow all the way. The interviewees among us will know that we often ask you to change it occasionally.

233
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I found out that Chinese parents, especially Taiwanese parents, still manage their children until they are in their 30s.

234
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
He may say that I don't care about it, I only have one thought that I care about, but more than half of them still continue to care about it.

235
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
In this case, you tell him that children like to be self-reliant

236
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,760
Self-reliance is different from self-reliance in Europe and the United States

237
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,960
because for all parents

238
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,560
as long as the child wants to read

239
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,000
I can afford it

240
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,360
It is my responsibility that you read at the age of 30

241
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,560
I think the parents here will probably say Amei

242
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,520
This has already begun to be completely different from European and American societies.

243
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,320
So it's worth our research

244
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,520
Then the localized development model

245
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,920
like we even asked some families about their parenting strategies

246
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,120
Last time I also reported to you

247
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,280
parents will say

248
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,200
Come on, junior high school kids

249
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,080
i don't watch tv

250
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,000
I don't go out either

251
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,840
I just concentrate on feeding him chicken soup

252
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,920
But kids don't feel like that

253
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,480
As a child, I feel that my parents have been controlling me

254
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,320
did you talk on the phone

255
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,680
have you dated anyone

256
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,240
so same problem

257
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,320
You put it on the parents and put it on the child

258
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,080
You can compare the answers when you ask them together.

259
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,000
probably like this

260
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,960
That's a long-term follow-up study

261
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,120
At the beginning there were about 5,000 people

262
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,360
noodle shop

263
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,360
In which we carried out several years later

264
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,840
We feel research

265
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It seems to give a very important structure

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But sometimes what everyone wants to see is flesh and blood

267
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
This flesh and blood is often what straightforward research can provide

268
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But if you only do literal research

269
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
In fact, what do you represent

270
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Everyone often has such a question

271
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
so we are lucky

272
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Some of our more than 5,000 samples can be found

273
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, do some in-depth interviews with teenagers about the belly.

274
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
so everyone can see

275
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Our samples are Guo 1 and Guo 3 in 2000

276
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The third year of junior high school was the last candidate

277
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
entrance examination system

278
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Country one is the new system

279
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Then I reported to you last time today.

280
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
there is a difference

281
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We later discovered that under the old system

282
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It should be said that under the new system

283
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Household income in the top 25%

284
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Chances of attending star high schools are remarkably high

285
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So it is true that the teaching reform brought some

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
greater inequality

287
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We predict the same

288
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That first stage is

289
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
20000 to 2009

290
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,960
We started in 1998

291
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,420
First bathroom in 1999

292
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,000
Then in 2000 a formal investigation was conducted

293
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
By 2009

294
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,500
They are basically the equivalent of a university

295
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
when you graduated from college

296
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
We were all debating whether to continue

297
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
Because I'm getting a little tired

298
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
will be tired

299
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,000
But I didn't expect a phone call to explain the law

300
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,500
It came back very well

301
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,000
We agreed to get our spirits up and do it again

302
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,500
Guys, let's take this survey

303
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,000
we have a time every friday

304
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
52 weeks a year and at least 40 more weeks

305
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We are all talking about paper coupons

306
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I brought such a result to Hong Kong

307
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Bring to Shanghai Bring to Beijing

308
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,500
say unconditionally

309
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
hope you do let us compare

310
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,500
They study the group. After each group discussion,

311
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Let's just say it's a bit difficult. It's too hard.

312
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,000
And then asked me how did you do it

313
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm just kidding, it's true

314
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,500
Let me say that you are young and ignorant

315
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
If you think you can do it, start doing it

316
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,000
Now that I think about it, I'm really happy

317
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,240
There is a group of like-minded friends who have come to this day

318
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,960
So what about our second phase?

319
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,320
adult sample from this time in 2011

320
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,900
Then we will combine the students from the first country and the third country

321
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,000
adult sample

322
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,520
So to put it simply

323
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,140
At that time, we surveyed two groups of samples almost every year

324
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,320
The questions asked by your first-year and third-year students are different

325
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,720
Junior high school is different

326
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,280
So every year we have to design a new topic

327
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,960
Then at that time add one of the parents

328
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,840
Also add a tutor

329
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,040
you can see

330
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
Then later pooling the adult samples

331
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,000
We decided we didn't need to do it every three years

332
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,560
Then you see when the parents started to enter

333
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,240
Average age 42

334
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,760
at the end of the first phase

335
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,040
Average age of parents is 52

336
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,480
We are very pleased that Vice President Huang of Zhongyuan Institute

337
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,800
with special support

338
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,160
We just sent our IRB to the hospital yesterday

339
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,840
We were still tweaking our questionnaire last week

340
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,760
This fall we will be

341
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,760
Parents with an average age of 62

342
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,000
It's parents who are young and old

343
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,960
Do the sixth follow-up survey

344
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,000
Because in their old age

345
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,640
relationship with acknowledgment of interactions among children

346
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,440
This is not the same as European and American society

347
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,920
we're not just going to discuss

348
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,920
Does the concept of school ethics still exist?

349
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,240
school morality

350
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,200
is already in your culture

351
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,320
How do you adjust and perform

352
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,000
This is the part we are very interested in

353
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,000
So we basically look like this

354
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,800
Then this is to let everyone know

355
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,600
because at this time we say

356
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
We don't know how long we can go

357
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,800
But for our sociology

358
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,600
It's important to be gendered

359
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,400
social class differences

360
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,800
So we believe that this northern Taiwan can

361
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,200
These three places allow us to

362
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,400
to achieve such a purpose

363
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,000
So the sample we start with

364
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,400
Probably the structure is like this

365
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,200
Mentor, each of us asks

366
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,200
One of the parents found out that 70% were mothers

367
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,000
So we want to catch up with dad this year

368
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,600
Would you like to join

369
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Principal of that country

370
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Later, under the suggestion of Academician Lin Nan

371
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
We also supplemented some of their resources

372
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Here is our sample

373
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You just believe it must be reliable

374
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And in the end, what is rare for us is

375
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
we sample the whole class

376
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
How many do you draw in each class

377
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Come out and sample the class

378
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
different

379
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Because the whole class is sampled you can follow along

380
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
they have a relationship between friends

381
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
For example, in the last report to you

382
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
in that sometimes good class

383
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Compared with this class with poor grades

384
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Find good students in poor class

385
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
more protected

386
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Because these naughty students

387
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
will feel that this good student

388
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
to protect a little

389
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
but if it is

390
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
middle grades

391
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Then he gets to medium and he gets affected sometimes

392
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So these are all because you sampled the whole class

393
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
you can see the difference

394
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So probably the actual answer rate is of course not bad.

395
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
simply speaking

396
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
using Western algorithms

397
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Our response rate should be considered high

398
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
why 102

399
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Because we start from scratch every time

400
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Just start with 5000

401
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Just start from 5000 and start sending from 5000

402
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But the algorithms in the West are all researched by me this year.

403
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Just compare with last year and see how much I have left

404
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That's more than 90

405
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
so we can even chase this place

406
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It took a lot of effort to chase after we decided

407
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
ok can continue

408
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Then our questionnaire construction is generally comparable

409
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
We also have our own feet

410
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
because you want to compare with international

411
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But you have to be like our joint good pressure

412
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
This thing must be designed by yourself.

413
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Does anyone have such a topic?

414
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So we will design some of these topics

415
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Compared with Xixi, they had these ideas about Fengliang's parents when they were young.

416
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
is also different

417
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
gender role attitudes

418
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Ask once for each stage as we do

419
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Junior high school, college, adult

420
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He is now in his 30s and

421
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You can see the change in this little kid from 13 to 31

422
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Then his parents asked the exact same question

423
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
you can have a vertical comparison

424
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Parents at the age of 42 and 52

425
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Will it affect

426
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
kids now

427
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,260
Okay, so we have some special problems

428
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,000
Then I don't know why I thought of doing this in-depth interview

429
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,500
general big plans

430
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,000
I remember Germany in 2005

431
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
When the National Science Council is about to start their 20,000-person investigation

432
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,500
once invited me to speak

433
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,000
I'll just talk to them

434
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,500
Our planning specially includes the interview of this teammate

435
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,300
is that we found something

436
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,500
you can't quantify

437
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,000
I remember hearing that they discussed it for half a year

438
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
because their psychologists would love to

439
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But then other scholars decided that it was too difficult

440
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
they just give up

441
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So I'm glad we still made it

442
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
like in retrospect

443
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
how long is this

444
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
As long as the door tells us he's free

445
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Manage what time the ends of the earth

446
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
we all cooperate

447
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Then two teachers and two assistants went to visit respectively

448
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Then look at some of their situations

449
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I still remember that time when we saw this girl from Beibei

450
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
parents will tell us

451
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The 50,000 yuan we discussed in the end

452
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Buying her a computer won't repair that roof

453
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Later, he went to the medical department of the National Defense Medical Academy.

454
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
we are really very happy

455
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Well, we've published straight talk research

456
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Also tell us that between parents and children

457
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Correspondence

458
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
When the expectations for future education are the same

459
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Of course it is best for children to learn

460
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
so this is

461
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
The month we discussed in the basement of the Mingzhi Institute

462
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Because everyone wants more samples for their questions

463
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
that won't work

464
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
must be fair

465
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So we use various methods

466
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
find these 60 pairs

467
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
so really being

468
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What are you doing today if there is an interviewee

469
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
we really appreciate you

470
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Because we didn't draw randomly

471
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I draw you out according to the rules

472
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And you promise you think how happy we are

473
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's the first phase of the research structure

474
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I also reported it last time

475
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Simply put, someone said

476
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What are your main findings in Phase 1?

477
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I said if you really want to talk

478
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
We're going to study homeschool community interactions

479
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
As found in many of our papers

480
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Early family experiences do have long-term effects

481
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
For example we have 40% look like

482
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
He actually lived with his grandparents for a while before he was 12.

483
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Three generations living under one roof

484
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Let him now have a more positive evaluation in terms of intergenerational relations

485
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
but the interesting thing is

486
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
If you live with your grandparents

487
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
He has negative feelings towards his father

488
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I still remember that time

489
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The editor-in-chief of Xigan in the United States has been asking me to explain this

490
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I said we haven't had a straight talk yet, what should I say?

491
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I said we could give us a Cruel

492
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That is to say, whatever you are in society

493
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Use a non-traditional atypical living arrangement

494
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Actually everyone

495
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The parties involved are aware of this situation

496
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So when you encounter non-traditional atypical

497
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's not actually in your best interest

498
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But I remember we explained it like this

499
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Then the education diversion I will talk about later

500
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Then Leaving Home and Education also published some articles

501
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
We found Sakuro

502
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The children in Yilan have the most experience away from home

503
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,300
This is true for employment and education

504
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,600
Then why start the second

505
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,800
We say after teens turn 22

506
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,000
he enters early adulthood

507
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
this experience

508
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And recently this one is prone to cough when talking a lot

509
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
no matter what

510
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
This You Track Teen Experiences Into Early Adulthood

511
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
you don't use backtracking

512
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's important that you master it right now

513
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And because we've had from middle school to early adulthood

514
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
mid term

515
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So it will have different life stages which links

516
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
We all have some important factors to look at

517
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,500
In addition, you compare the differences between the parent and child generations

518
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,700
We don't seem to be doing a good job at the moment.

519
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,500
But this is where this material can be invaluable

520
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,500
So the second stage samples are simply

521
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,500
We have a sample of ordinary people and we have conducted a total of three waves of surveys

522
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:28,000
2011 14 and 17 we all start in October every year

523
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
so every other year

524
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,500
As a result, after returning in 11 years, I got the materials in 12 years

525
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,500
We found that 7% are married

526
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
I remember at that time my heart moved

527
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Wow, if the spouse survey can be done at this time

528
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,500
It's like the beginning of his family formation

529
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
we collect data

530
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
how precious it is

531
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,500
I still remember that time our group had a little discussion

532
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Professor Zhang Yinghua is still in our advisory committee, and the report says

533
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
According to the boss

534
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,400
just have to do

535
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,440
It's like saying I must buy that dress

536
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,000
I still think my mother is joking

537
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,140
Sorry for the recording today

538
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,000
I speak well

539
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Come

540
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So our first wave of spouse surveys

541
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,200
After the decision in 2012, we will implement it in 2013

542
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Then from the second wave, we will implement it in the second year

543
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,000
The third wave of investigations was completed last year.

544
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,800
So let's put it simply

545
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,300
if you forget later

546
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,100
7% here are married

547
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,600
Average age 25

548
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,200
19% to 20% here are married

549
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,700
Average age 28

550
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,200
In this third wave of surveys, there are more than 39%

551
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,000
almost 40

552
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,500
This is consistent with our government statistics

553
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,400
so we are happy

554
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,500
I won't talk about this

555
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,900
we have some topics that are different

556
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,400
Simply put, what I just said

557
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,900
Now probably won't be able to make it to 40

558
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,800
if not

559
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,300
40-year-old parents and 40-year-old teenagers

560
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,000
the whole vertical metaphor

561
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,200
that is really necessary

562
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,600
amazing thing

563
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,900
I hope some of our colleagues here are willing to take the list

564
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,720
hehehehe

565
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,320
good

566
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,020
Collect the whole data and look

567
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,280
wow, really powerful

568
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,560
Probably all that I just reported to you

569
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,220
It's all on this list

570
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,400
I take it apart

571
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,160
first stage

572
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,660
You can see that I put the net reverse rate

573
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,920
write on it

574
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,000
Everyone should know that when they were in middle school

575
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,520
We are ballpoint pens, aren't we?

576
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,120
Because our funds have always been consolidated

577
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,720
I'm sorry, at that time, it was really fundraising.

578
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,960
Later, after funding

579
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,280
We also give two hundred Taiwan dollars

580
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,120
what about the money

581
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,800
I found the West and exchanged it for US dollars

582
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,480
I'm a little embarrassed

583
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,900
But I don't think it's okay

584
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,320
this meaningful thing

585
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,960
Doesn't necessarily require a lot of resources

586
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,960
we just try to do it

587
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,520
so so probably

588
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,560
The second stage can be seen

589
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,640
we started

590
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,200
All are from the original more than 5,000

591
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,080
but remember

592
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,200
It was already the tenth wave and the eleventh wave.

593
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,280
when the past nine waves

594
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,680
many people don't answer

595
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,160
he just jumps

596
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,300
Jumped out, I just talked about 60 or so, some 30 or so jumped out

597
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,860
We still try our best to ask these people

598
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,840
If the visitor says you have to knock on the door three times, it will be counted.

599
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
No, so this stressful time is too much for the interviewer

600
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,920
Every time we do a survey, we get some

601
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,120
complaint letter

602
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,260
i mean please

603
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,100
I'm not good at English, when did you want to talk like this?

604
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,840
We used to ask Mr. Zhang Honghua

605
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,680
The reply letter of the eight tails of the video, in fact, let’s talk about it

606
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,700
Just a word, we do academic research, we will continue to come

607
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,060
On the contrary, let me dismiss your intention

608
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,380
Later, after discussion, everyone said that this thing is not very fair to visitors.

609
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,880
So we put those that are no longer there

610
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,820
And it has already clearly stated the people he interviewed in the drama

611
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,360
After removing him, we'll do it all over again

612
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,360
Then you can see that the second wave has better results

613
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,360
Then the third wave had better results

614
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,540
During the same time period, we conduct interviews

615
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,540
keep track, the original

616
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,060
Fifty one, sixty, keep chasing, chasing until now

617
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,060
Seventeen are still in there and no one else

618
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
we don't want to

619
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And partly because

620
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
The focus of our interview has changed slightly

621
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
i will say

622
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So simply say for example

623
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Qualitative research has 22

624
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
i want to thank you very much

625
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I don't know how many of you

626
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
We have visited four waves

627
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The third and fourth waves begin

628
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
We don't have to go to Yilan

629
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
They came to us on a motorcycle

630
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
This is really different

631
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But I really went to Yilan

632
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
i still remember our assistant

633
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
When I go to Yilan to visit

634
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
the next car

635
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
i saw him lick ken

636
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I just remember that man's house was there

637
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
He said teacher how do you know

638
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I say because of the interviewee

639
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
let me dove twice

640
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
so i know exactly where his house is

641
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
things like this

642
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
just look at him

643
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
in the same class

644
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
children in class together

645
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
now some will be in

646
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
fishing port to visit him

647
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Some cook clear soup in the west

648
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Some dads call and say

649
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
He is studying abroad for a Ph.D.

650
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
come back later

651
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
this is what we talk about

652
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Multiple Growth Trajectories

653
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
in my heart

654
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Feeling

655
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Then we will continue to visit in the future

656
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,200
Simply put, we want to visit 20 unmarried

657
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,500
40 married

658
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,400
In this regard, we also ask Dr. Yuan Yongzhen for help.

659
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,300
Then enter today's topic

660
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,500
pretty much what i said

661
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,700
I also want to talk about the front for half an hour

662
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,500
I'm going to talk about the long-term effects of family experience.

663
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Long-term effects of educational diversion and educational achievement

664
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,500
and the marriage and childbearing of the current young generation

665
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,000
Our topic is called Zhuan Daren

666
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,800
So I must tell you what it means to become an adult.

667
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
So I added it this morning

668
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,300
If you transfer to an adult, it is usually in academic research

669
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,800
oldest this this this this

670
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,600
Usage This is Professor Shi Dalin Ruping

671
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,900
He finished an article he gave us later

672
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,300
Probably finish school and find a job

673
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,600
Get married, have a family, have children, etc.

674
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,500
But Zhuan adults are one

675
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,000
objective

676
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
or subjective determination

677
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
did you say

678
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
When you are eighteen, you will be an adult

679
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
you become an adult

680
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
what about things like this

681
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
what about now

682
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
There are some called big three

683
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
you are responsible

684
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
make your own decisions

685
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
economically independent

686
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
to be honest

687
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
This is the same as the old indicator

688
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
that is more difficult to measure

689
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Yes or no

690
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
what do you mean by making your own decision

691
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
own responsibility

692
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
This is relatively simple

693
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
But everyone thinks this is not enough

694
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
because they think this thing

695
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
is a subjective determination

696
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
He needs some objective indicators

697
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
to match him

698
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
so we just

699
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
use this scale

700
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Then we made a scale

701
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
This scale is mainly based on Western

702
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
The adult scale they made

703
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
But we will also cooperate

704
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Our own Taiwan special

705
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
social context

706
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
For example, wind foster parents to parents before

707
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
This is probably the West

708
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
there will be no such topic

709
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Then the result

710
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
The discovery can be divided into two major

711
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
One is a mature personality

712
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Will you wait for others

713
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
One is social role transformation

714
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It is more like the traditional one just mentioned earlier.

715
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
As a result you can see

716
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
What men and women say

717
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Personality Maturity Vs Social Transformation

718
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
more recognized

719
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
it has a higher score

720
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Is there more than 4 o'clock and more than 3 o'clock?

721
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Then

722
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
This indicator is also the same as that of Western studies

723
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Interestingly, males are more

724
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Greater recognition of the norms of social norms

725
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
simply speaking

726
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
from the 1970s

727
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
research on attitudes towards gender roles

728
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
There are two results that have not changed until now

729
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And it's the same all over the world

730
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
First, men are more conservative than women

731
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
more traditional

732
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
The second highly educated

733
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
less educated than

734
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
less conservative

735
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
probably these two

736
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
whatever you do it won't change

737
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
We study in Taiwan

738
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
There are three unfilial

739
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
After Empress Wu was great, she must give birth

740
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
son's study also vent so

741
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And after the fertility rate drops

742
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
This is even more so

743
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Originally, with the development of society

744
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
This concept should go all the way down

745
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
But when we were in 2008

746
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
when you have a problem

747
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
it rises immediately

748
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So the general public

749
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
the answer is quite rational

750
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
We really want to trust everyone's answers

751
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
good

752
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Then the long-term impact of family structure

753
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
There are many teachers in our group

754
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Including Mr. Zhong Yuhui present here, etc.

755
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
are here for a long time

756
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I think I'll tell you something here

757
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
family experiences we care about

758
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
a structure a relationship

759
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
what is its long-term effect

760
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Then because I'm on the summary

761
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
There is a special mention of parental divorce

762
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
What is the impact on the children

763
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Then I will give you a report here

764
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Let's use a sample from this country to see

765
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
In 2000, the first year of the National

766
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
both his parents

767
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
No divorce is 87

768
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
At the age of 22, it changed to 83.5

769
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
At the age of 31, change

770
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,420
75.2 Why?

771
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,540
This is a divorce or separation

772
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,880
did you see

773
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,580
increase 0.5 0.5

774
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,940
probably not that much

775
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,220
but one of the parents died

776
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,980
increased a lot

777
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,340
So among today's 31-year-old adults

778
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,300
we will see

779
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,820
about a quarter

780
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,860
Not all parents are together

781
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,460
So the family structure changes

782
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,220
if you want to do research

783
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,580
You are divided into two-parent families and non-two-parent families

784
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,500
about what i said

785
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,980
about three quarters

786
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,980
This thing is most related to blunt

787
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,260
you can see

788
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,420
College Graduation for Two-Parent Families

789
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,020
The ratio is relatively high, right?

790
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:46,140
Those who graduated from high school in non-parental families

791
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,620
relatively high ratio

792
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,900
So there are some differences in education level

793
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,180
then i will talk next

794
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,500
I start from the family structure and family relationship

795
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,820
Impact on Adolescents' Journeys

796
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,100
I'll jump off us first

797
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,400
PYP shows you how our population structure has changed

798
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,600
The problem of declining birthrate and aging population

799
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,000
And then from the parental divorce what we call the incomplete family upbringing

800
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
To observe the development of intimate relationships and family formation in adulthood

801
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
this piece

802
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,200
This is the number of children born

803
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,000
You can see that in 1976 we had 420,000 births in Taiwan

804
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,600
The lowest time was only 160,000

805
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
180,000 were born last year

806
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So our fertility rate is declining very fast

807
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
The red ones tell you that this is the fertility rate

808
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,400
down like this

809
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,800
then why

810
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,200
you can see

811
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,400
As long as it is a farming year, the fertility rate must increase

812
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,000
All the way down, there will be a high wind in the agricultural year

813
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,000
This is how I see cultural norms from this graph

814
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,000
This thing that never dies

815
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
That

816
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,640
Taiwan is very important

817
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,960
Do you see the lonely year

818
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,560
Marriage rate dropped from 6.5 to 5

819
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,840
don't get married

820
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,240
Year of the Tiger

821
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,360
That's when our Taiwan had the lowest birth rate in the world

822
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,080
Because people don't want to have children

823
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,520
the government is very worried

824
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,920
Fortunately, the next year is the 100th year of the Republic of China, advertising everywhere

825
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,400
Originally a hundred years and what a hundred years

826
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,560
A hundred years of harmony is not enough

827
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,000
The second year is the Year of the Dragon

828
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,440
that all the parents are trying to do

829
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,720
if the children have a spouse

830
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,440
get married quickly

831
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,840
I just hope to give birth to a dragon son or a dragon girl.

832
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,760
you can see

833
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
Year of the Dragon jumps so high in the second year

834
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,040
But now it's slowly falling

835
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,280
if you look at this

836
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,960
you can see the divorce rate

837
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,720
It's probably leveled off.

838
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,000
So the marriage rate goes up and down

839
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,640
Only a hundred years of happiness and birth

840
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,120
then came down again

841
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,720
but this

842
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,440
As long as it is the Year of the Tiger

843
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,120
as long as it is the year of the dragon

844
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Must be born

845
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,620
So you're in a downward spiral

846
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,620
When you meet the Year of the Dragon, give birth

847
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,280
we are in such a society

848
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
I just want to share with you

849
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,280
The influence of cultural norms

850
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,120
sometimes you don't even have to ask

851
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,000
agree or disagree he is here

852
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,300
he is like this

853
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,240
So in terms of unmarried men and women in Taiwan

854
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,720
everyone can see

855
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,080
Of course, the unmarried rate of women is high

856
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,420
But it's quite high

857
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
So back to our own research

858
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,500
Let's talk about whether the family structure has any influence

859
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
we know low birth rates

860
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,000
this problem is serious

861
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And the phenomenon of marriage metaphor package

862
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It means that the society still does not accept out-of-wedlock children

863
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I remember when I was doing an interview

864
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
He said that the unmarried pregnant interviewee

865
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Tell me he doesn't even want to marry him

866
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Because he thinks he can't get along with him and doesn't love each other

867
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Parents say I don't care if you love each other or not

868
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
you hurry to get married

869
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
divorce after childbirth

870
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,460
Then I think hey, yes

871
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,340
This is the wedding package we've been talking about

872
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,440
child to be born in marriage

873
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,040
this is very important

874
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,960
so what

875
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,700
Why Young People Lack Motivation to Marry and Have Children

876
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,100
this is what everyone is asking

877
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,140
Let's start with family experience

878
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,840
In particular our data allow us to explore from early experience

879
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,540
then speaking

880
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,800
Early Family Experiences for Adolescents

881
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,800
Regardless of childhood and adolescence

882
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,700
Are the parents divorced?

883
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,100
In many Chinese families, the parents do not divorce

884
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,600
but conflicting

885
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,300
complete family

886
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,800
We also call it a complete family here.

887
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,400
But what if we add a disguise?

888
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,500
parent-child conflict

889
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,300
Early experiences of adolescence

890
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,000
Dating Behavior in Your Early Adulthood

891
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,340
what are the marriage expectations

892
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,700
especially in your 30s

893
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,100
We can talk about the actual act of marriage

894
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,800
Everyone here should know

895
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,140
Because newspapers and magazines often say

896
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,200
The average age of marriage in Taiwan

897
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,000
Probably male 32 years old

898
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,260
30 years old girl

899
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,560
So we also say that our data is just right

900
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,860
react to such a situation

901
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,900
I can only speak quickly

902
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,400
Generally speaking, the situation of children under divorced parents will tell you

903
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,600
His self-esteem comes first

904
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,040
bad grades wait

905
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
negative impact

906
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,040
And often tell you it will last into adulthood

907
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,440
However, it is uncertain in the literature that

908
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,640
After parents divorce, children are less likely to want to marry

909
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,400
Or get married early

910
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,000
Because if a child doesn't want to marry it's because he sees conflict

911
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,300
Seeing that the parent-child relationship is not good

912
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,800
But some marry early because he thinks he needs a

913
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,500
relation

914
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,000
He comes from a place where resources are relatively scarce

915
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,600
He needs to get into marriage

916
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,400
So this is the one we want to know

917
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,800
The topic of the research is as follows

918
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,100
so what

919
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,000
We climb points complete family divorced family

920
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,700
We pay special attention to this divorced family

921
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,400
when he got divorced

922
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,100
Before 13 or 12

923
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,400
12, Stan's Upper or Under 12

924
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,400
Then full family, we join a cumulative conflict

925
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
go see the difference

926
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600
We want the explanation to be him

927
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,600
Dating Behavior in Early Adulthood, Late Adolescence and His Marriage Expectations

928
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,600
That's when you're 19 to 20 years old

929
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,200
simply speaking

930
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,800
As you can see, let's say it's a two-parent family

931
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,600
Probably this ratio

932
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,000
But my parents divorced when I was in elementary school

933
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,600
How is he, compared to 13 years old

934
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,000
After the age of 13, the parents experience the divorce of their parents

935
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,200
He has relatively no marriage expectations, he won't say he wants to get married

936
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,800
But before the age of 12, there are more dating partners

937
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,400
and the number of people who are dating

938
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,000
He is more interested in the development of intimacy, so let's talk about it

939
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
What about parental conflict?

940
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,200
He acted like the one whose parents divorced after the age of 13

941
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
that that category

942
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,500
So in addition, we also found in this study

943
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,000
It can be seen that the sense of attachment between parents and children is very important

944
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
If you compare your relationship with your father

945
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
good words you are less likely to say

946
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,500
we have marriage expectations

947
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
Divorce if your child wife and parents

948
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,000
But if you have a good relationship with your mother

949
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,500
You also have less expectation of marriage

950
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
In other words, everyone can hear

951
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,000
Divorce or not is a family structure

952
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
But you are in a divorced family structure

953
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,500
relationship with parents family relationship

954
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,000
can have some harmonizing effect

955
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
like this

956
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,500
So if you're with a two-parent family

957
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
And the group with low conflict

958
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,000
Parents' Early Divorce Experience

959
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
lead to young adulthood

960
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,500
Negative effects of intimacy

961
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
So sometimes I have been busy for a year and a half

962
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Everyone just got this sentence

963
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,500
Everyone listened in one go

964
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,500
well then

965
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
adult children

966
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,800
We found from 201114

967
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,400
It's strange, parents can't get divorced

968
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,200
It has little to do with his actual marriage

969
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,360
Definitely a two-parent family

970
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,520
Grown children are less likely to seek marriage

971
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,920
probably so

972
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,880
so we say what to do

973
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,360
Okay, let's guess step by step. Don't worry.

974
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,800
Let's first invite Professor Dai Cuier from Taipei University

975
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,720
For the 7% of 25-year-olds who were married in 2011

976
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,920
let's see what's going on

977
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,040
literature tells us

978
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,200
Families High in Conflict Have Lower Marriage Expectations

979
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,800
Does that mean you're less likely to seek marriage when you're 25?

980
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,320
Well, after he made various arrangements,

981
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,480
I'll show you first

982
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,600
we are probably like this now

983
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,280
These married people we DIP married people

984
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,880
This is probably the case

985
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,760
He has fathered children quite tall

986
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,560
In other words, marriage and childbirth are a package

987
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,920
He's getting married, he's really going to have kids

988
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,360
but give birth within seven months of marriage

989
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,240
I do not include those born before marriage

990
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,280
So this pre-marriage

991
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,080
For example this is 52%

992
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,960
at the age of 25

993
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,020
What is it called?

994
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,940
In fact, not only 52%

995
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,260
Because 89% of you are already born

996
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,100
you can say it like this

997
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,980
Then we also ask by the way

998
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,940
But when you're 28 or 31, it's more normal, right?

999
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,360
Then you can see

1000
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,300
contemporary young couple

1001
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,520
These are all under 32

1002
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,140
The average ratio of living with parents is quite high

1003
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,260
This is of course related to economic resources

1004
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,940
This is absolutely different from European and American countries.

1005
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,880
Taiwan is in the middle of East Asia

1006
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,920
It has always been relatively similar to the Korean model.

1007
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,440
But I don't know if they have such information

1008
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,180
then you can see

1009
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,680
On one side of the island, the husband and the parents are the main ones

1010
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,680
There will be no fewer than Qifang's parents

1011
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,320
good

1012
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,480
Professor Dai Xuwei and others

1013
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,780
He said I'd first look at pregnancy before marriage

1014
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:53,680
I found out my parents divorced when I was 13

1015
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,240
more likely to lead to premarital pregnancy

1016
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,400
You have cohabitation and premarital sexual experience

1017
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
possible

1018
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,000
So what about early marriage, will you find out that your parents are divorced and gone?

1019
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,820
But this thing came out

1020
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,940
In other words, this is called the family structure

1021
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,960
this is called family relationship

1022
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,460
And in this relationship, parent-child conflict is high

1023
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,340
He is more likely to marry early

1024
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,300
But seeing the conflict between parents

1025
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,960
Less likely to get married but not to marry early

1026
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,800
So in adolescence, it's very similar to what I just said earlier.

1027
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,420
Adolescent Witnessing Parents Arguing

1028
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,720
and divorced parents will reduce his desire to marry

1029
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,880
But if there is a conflict between parents and children

1030
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,440
Instead he hurried to get married

1031
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,640
So in this study

1032
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,000
If parents divorced before the age of 13

1033
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,880
Will affect pre-marital pregnancy of children

1034
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,800
But it won't affect your early marriage

1035
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,720
Early adolescence, high parental conflict will not marry early

1036
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,600
High parent-child conflict leads to early marriage, it's clear

1037
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,440
But those with cohabitation and premarital relationships are also more likely to marry early

1038
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,320
Is that clear?

1039
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,560
I'm very hardworking

1040
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,560
To put it simply, there is a marriage package phenomenon

1041
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,040
You said that between cultural norms and economic change

1042
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,880
This level of tension is a characteristic of Chinese society

1043
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,560
The parcels of the marriage between generations are all in this place

1044
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,080
However, Western studies often talk about an economic capacity

1045
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,520
something that affects you a lot that we're just going to observe

1046
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,720
But economic ability, they found that it is beneficial to men

1047
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,440
The effect of living in different places has contributed

1048
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,040
Contribute to him to get married, but it is the opposite for girls

1049
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,520
Girls who have high financial ability are less likely to think that they are married

1050
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,520
hope and desire

1051
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,160
so so we say ok , let's look at 28 years old

1052
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,360
during the second wave

1053
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,480
What's the problem, 25 years old

1054
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,920
I think if you call him an early marriage, no one will have a problem

1055
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,240
Because he obeyed his son's order to get married, that's why

1056
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,480
Well, at the age of 28, just now he is slowly approaching normal

1057
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,480
So Ma Guoxun

1058
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,200
Professor Ma Guoxun, I am asking this question

1059
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,420
I think what's the reason you got married and got out of prison?

1060
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,920
is there any difference

1061
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,620
I'll go faster here

1062
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,700
I just let everyone know we're not kidding

1063
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,340
we really take it seriously

1064
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,700
Especially our Vice President Huang

1065
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,220
is our funding

1066
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,140
we need to tell him

1067
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,860
look at

1068
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,540
there is a recording for today

1069
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,300
this structural factor

1070
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,360
Normative factors

1071
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,940
relational factors

1072
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,460
I just said that structure is a resource

1073
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,240
relationship is also a resource

1074
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,380
This is the big trend

1075
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,100
it's interpersonal

1076
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,660
The other is cultural norms

1077
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,780
Then generally do it, of course it depends on whether you are learning

1078
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,780
Is there a job?

1079
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,740
fine human ability

1080
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,140
Then we use the survey of the main book

1081
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,900
All the way from 16 years old to 20 to 30 years old

1082
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,980
Then use the first two waves of spouse surveys

1083
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,660
Then use this model to do

1084
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,740
What we're trying to explain is the age of marriage

1085
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,540
with the age of release from prison

1086
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,500
analysis in disguise

1087
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,180
e.g. structural disguise

1088
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,580
we used where are you

1089
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,700
Parents' Education Achievement Family Income

1090
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,600
relatively large

1091
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,120
normative attitude

1092
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,120
gender role attitudes

1093
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,440
what traditional family values

1094
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,720
in terms of family relations

1095
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,200
We used negative parent-child conflict

1096
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,920
positive family ties

1097
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,280
These are the constitution

1098
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,480
Then we add another question

1099
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,600
when i was fifteen

1100
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,920
Whether the parents are divorced or separated

1101
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,400
Because I just used twelve

1102
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,600
then thirteen to sixteen

1103
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,320
Then I'll see if you're fifteen to cut the root

1104
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,600
what's the difference

1105
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,560
This is an academic research to try

1106
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,680
Then this is all there

1107
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,280
we all do it

1108
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,480
I just take this example

1109
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,000
Let's see marriage first

1110
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,800
You will see the marriage rate in Yilan

1111
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,000
taller than them

1112
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,720
less educated parents

1113
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,640
more likely to find marriage

1114
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,520
But in terms of family income

1115
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,920
Male household income and financial status

1116
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,920
more abundant

1117
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,880
He is more likely to marry

1118
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,800
no effect on women

1119
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,080
look at this get out of prison

1120
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,160
It seems to be the same as the complete copy

1121
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,960
But here women come out

1122
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,360
didn't it matter just now?

1123
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,360
The female family gave back

1124
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,600
less abundant more likely

1125
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,400
Giving birth, this place is different

1126
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,900
Let's use this method to explain one by one

1127
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,400
You look like first marriage too

1128
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,400
Men with good family relationships will marry early

1129
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,900
no effect on women

1130
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,900
However, when the age of 15, the parents were divorced or separated.

1131
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,900
It has no effect on men, but on women it will lead to early marriage

1132
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,900
clear gender difference

1133
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,400
I am consistent with many documents

1134
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,600
Early Childhood is the same

1135
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,100
You see, if the family relationship is good, men will give birth early

1136
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,100
Parents divorce, women will have early childbearing

1137
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,100
no effect on other

1138
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,100
we sit all the way

1139
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:38,100
Conclusions are structural, relational and normative factors

1140
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:42,100
will affect the marriage and childbearing of Taiwan's younger generation

1141
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,100
For researchers

1142
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,100
Some important disguises you will come into contact with when studying architecture

1143
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,100
Such a result

1144
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,100
psychologically happy

1145
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,100
then on the other hand

1146
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,100
Importantly, the effect of gender differences

1147
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,100
very obvious

1148
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,100
for men

1149
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,100
His family income was relatively high before he was a teenager

1150
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
good family relationship

1151
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And he currently has a job

1152
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
He is more likely to marry and have children before the age of 28

1153
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
But for women

1154
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
If parents are divorced or separated

1155
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
He is more likely to marry and have children

1156
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
But when he was a teenager, his family income was high

1157
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
he currently has a job

1158
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
he is less likely to marry

1159
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
less likely to have children

1160
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
So this is the model that is equal to the income of the western economy

1161
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Get verified here

1162
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
so in short

1163
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Have financial ability and early positive family life experience

1164
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Powerful masculinity is negative for women

1165
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And if the parents divorce before the middle teens,

1166
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
More likely to cause women's early marriage and early childbearing

1167
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
That is, he may come from an environment that is less resource-advantaged

1168
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
he needs a relationship

1169
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
What about the next 31 years old?

1170
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Every researcher has their own unique

1171
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
research interest and the point of view he wants to explore

1172
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,880
So many interviewees said why they always have the same problem

1173
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,600
Because every stage is different

1174
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,040
The overall look will be different, right?

1175
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,280
so let's look at this

1176
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,640
What Professor Liu Jiahua of Tamkang said about our previous Post

1177
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,280
He made some long-term effects on the integrity of the family structure

1178
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,400
You want to see if there is a difference for gender

1179
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,640
OK, let's combine the two sets of samples.

1180
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,680
The one just now was shown to you with a national art sample

1181
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,920
Both groups look together

1182
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,520
You can see that about 76.4 means that the parents are still there

1183
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,480
No divorce, one parent is dead

1184
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,240
Already 14% at an average age of 61

1185
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:41,640
Then the divorce rate is about 9.7, which is about 10%.

1186
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,160
Then the marital status of the parents

1187
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,760
You said the two-parent marriage continued and the parents were divorced.

1188
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,200
Percentage of married to one of the deceased parents

1189
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,520
That's probably how marriage lasts up to

1190
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,000
But the parents are divorced

1191
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,440
we break it down into so many stages

1192
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,000
one is a baby wife

1193
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
A primary school period, a teenage period, a college period, and an adult period

1194
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
As you can see, ages 6 to 17 are significantly lower, very much

1195
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Because the average parental divorce is 36, but only 31 in these two stages

1196
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
However, children whose parents divorced in childhood were most likely to marry

1197
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
It depends on whether there is any difference between men and women. These three are the ones I explained just now.

1198
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Since we are 6 to 12 and 13 to 17 are low, we have to combine them

1199
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
You can see that among those whose parents are divorced, it affects men the most

1200
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,000
If he has no parents in childhood, he is most likely to marry early, and he will marry like this

1201
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It cannot be said that he married early, because he is 31 years old, but when he is at school age, he is the least likely to get married

1202
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
The same is true for women. After a woman reaches adulthood, her parents will divorce and she will rise again.

1203
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Some people say that it may be better to use a picture to represent this thing

1204
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,800
more obvious isn't it

1205
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,800
For me I think the number is more obvious

1206
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,200
but it's okay you see

1207
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,440
When children are six to seven years old

1208
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,160
It's really unlikely to get married.

1209
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,120
This gray one is all

1210
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,960
blue is male

1211
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,920
red is rain

1212
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,080
Just look at the time from one to fifteen years old

1213
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,280
Boys are the most likely to marry, right?

1214
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,040
That woman's parents divorced during adulthood

1215
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,560
He is also more likely to marry

1216
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,640
Then come down again, what do you think?

1217
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,680
you first than

1218
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,320
Is that a category just now?

1219
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,520
did not look together

1220
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,320
you can't just say for sure

1221
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,160
It's really bad to get a divorce.

1222
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,360
worse than dead parents

1223
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,160
you don't know

1224
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,840
because you watch it together

1225
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,000
if you look at it together

1226
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,400
you will find

1227
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,760
One of the parents died is the least likely to marry

1228
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,720
He's more prominent than a divorce

1229
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,560
So let's confirm this first

1230
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,120
see you later

1231
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:53,960
what about divorce

1232
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,440
I still divide these time points the same

1233
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,440
Compared with the death of one of the parents

1234
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,200
discovering that one of the parents has passed away

1235
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
is a persistent and significant

1236
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
at least for men

1237
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And at school age

1238
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
if parents divorce

1239
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Significantly lower for men too

1240
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Not so serious for women

1241
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Is that clear?

1242
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Then next this

1243
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
tell us what

1244
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
At least we are 31 years old

1245
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Adult children come to see

1246
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
you and family structure

1247
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
completely complete compared to

1248
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
The death of a parent will reduce the

1249
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
possibility of marriage

1250
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
but the parents divorced

1251
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
did not achieve a significant effect

1252
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
it looks like you just

1253
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Is the divorce you want to talk about gone?

1254
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
But this place is here

1255
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
so we see

1256
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
sooner or later parents divorce

1257
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Impact on children's likelihood of marriage

1258
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
son is Mr.

1259
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
The daughter was born first

1260
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
right

1261
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
right, right?

1262
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
son is Mr.

1263
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
The daughter was born first

1264
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
The third

1265
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
The point of divorce between parents is children

1266
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
The greatest impact on men

1267
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
more dangerous for men

1268
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Okay, so just at this point we saw that one of the parents passed away.

1269
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
The same is true for men

1270
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
obvious impact

1271
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
So whether it's divorce or death

1272
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
The family structure has changed

1273
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
The marriage of the sons as adults

1274
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
have a negative impact

1275
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
So it's probably like this

1276
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
ok so to put it simply

1277
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I just spent a little more time talking to you about the above

1278
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Structural Relational Factors Long-Term Effects

1279
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Just take this early family experience of parental divorce

1280
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
The conclusions of our current research can be condensed into these few sentences

1281
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
You can see the divorce of childhood parents

1282
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
You're More Likely To Date You're Pregnant Before Marriage

1283
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
but not early marriage

1284
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
But if the teenage parents divorce

1285
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
you don't want to get married

1286
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
but for women

1287
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Instead, it increases his chances of early marriage and early childbearing

1288
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Parent-child conflict in the family relationship

1289
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Often take care of the children and leave the family to get married

1290
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
but see

1291
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,320
parental conflict not parent-child conflict

1292
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,680
He doesn't want to get married

1293
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,880
He is also less likely to marry early

1294
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,400
That family cohesion is high

1295
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,920
Family relationship plays a role in boys' early marriage and early childbearing

1296
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,600
So this is also an example

1297
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,720
Said that the government wants people to get married and have children all the time

1298
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,960
In fact, what should be tried is

1299
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,160
work hard on family education

1300
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,520
At least for men it is very noticeable effect

1301
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,000
OK, then I'll move on to the second topic.

1302
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,920
It is our educational diversion

1303
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,520
Then this educational diversion

1304
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,040
our many studies

1305
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,400
I'm doing a little integration here

1306
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,480
The first diversion was probably when we were in high school

1307
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,800
18 years old for the second diversion

1308
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,320
Then when the first average

1309
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,240
you can see about half and half

1310
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,440
It is about half and half for those who study high value or junior college in high school

1311
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,160
at the age of 18

1312
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:55,840
You can see that 74% of high school students went to colleges and universities

1313
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,800
But there are also 10% who take the exam

1314
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,800
then in

1315
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,960
When I was a freshman and when I was a senior in high school, 14 was still there

1316
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,960
I've already gone to work or to tutoring

1317
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,960
As for the 50% of this

1318
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,960
What about the Higher Vocational Technology University, you can see it

1319
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,360
4.7% went to university

1320
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,160
Most are still in HKUST

1321
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,760
But the rate of work is of course very high

1322
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,260
It is also conceivable

1323
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,260
Taiwan's education competition, this is

1324
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,460
I guess none of us would

1325
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,860
I won't doubt it, so I can skip it here

1326
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:31,320
In particular, I think we've seen in research

1327
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,320
Families and schools actually affect children's academic performance

1328
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,820
is very consistent

1329
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,560
i most remember i used to say

1330
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,560
Because Professor Zhou Yuhui and Professor Huang Langman

1331
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,960
Our colleagues have done

1332
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,060
Quality of life of middle-aged parents

1333
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,560
Of course parent-child relationship is very important

1334
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,560
a factor but

1335
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,560
I don't think the West will have this thing

1336
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,960
Children's homework is good for mother's this

1337
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,460
Living Responsible Significant Role

1338
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,060
think about how interesting it is

1339
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,060
Is this already mentioned?

1340
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,120
We talked about a lot of things in context

1341
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,000
right

1342
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,720
good

1343
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,320
So we started to focus on the research topic of educational diversion

1344
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,800
Let's say from the perspective of mental health trajectory

1345
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,240
We just have a set of topics

1346
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,680
we use it every time

1347
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,920
This group of questions is probably the only question

1348
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,680
guys i know some of you say

1349
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,720
when we visit

1350
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,640
Because he has answered it ten times

1351
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,640
so visit him

1352
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,880
do you have this or something

1353
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,000
none below none

1354
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,400
then turn the page

1355
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,680
Because he has answered more than ten times

1356
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,880
He didn't even have that page

1357
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,480
just turn the page

1358
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,080
don't suddenly grow old sometimes

1359
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:32,880
still will be different

1360
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,800
still have to ask

1361
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,360
good

1362
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:40,000
Then our sample ranges from the first wave to the twenty-seventh year old

1363
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,200
I can show you

1364
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,160
what about the other

1365
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,480
Professor Fan Ganghua and I have worked together

1366
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,080
We take high school or above

1367
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,640
see how it's been for a while

1368
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:53,200
Students who do not study because they graduated from junior high school

1369
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,280
Also the sample of departures is not that high

1370
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,560
This is for everyone to see

1371
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,760
This is the most typical

1372
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,500
In the growth process of Chinese and American teenagers

1373
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,500
his melancholic state

1374
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,500
you can see

1375
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:11,340
He started skyrocketing to 18 when he was 15

1376
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,340
very high

1377
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,140
The red ones are women and the blue ones are men

1378
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,140
black is average

1379
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:20,140
But from here, it began to slowly plateau

1380
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,340
This is what we call

1381
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,860
physiological maturation model

1382
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,940
this is a natural

1383
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,940
Naturally it should look like this

1384
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,940
So what is Taiwan like?

1385
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,940
is so

1386
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:34,940
Last time I told you a little bit about this

1387
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:36,940
22 years old

1388
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,940
15 years old with the highest depression

1389
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,940
Why are you going to high school?

1390
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,940
16 years old so happy

1391
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,940
17 years old

1392
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,940
At the age of 18, I started to be tall again, right?

1393
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,940
going to university

1394
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,940
we were weird

1395
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,940
I don't know why 20 is so tall

1396
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,940
Later we were thinking

1397
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,940
Some of the 20-year-olds have graduated from higher vocational schools

1398
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,940
Served in the military for two years

1399
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,940
he has his certain pressure

1400
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Back then we only saw here

1401
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
then slowly descend

1402
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Is that so until 27

1403
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
In fact, it should add 31

1404
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Just need to continue to add 31

1405
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
then you can watch girls

1406
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Girls are taller than boys all over the world

1407
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
But here there is a

1408
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
When I graduated from university at the age of 22

1409
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
is there a merge point

1410
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
What about the boys?

1411
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Boys will be happier all the way

1412
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
But here he is taller

1413
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
22 years old when everyone graduated

1414
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
a little nervous scary

1415
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I went down again and felt good again

1416
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Boys only feel good about themselves

1417
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I feel good about this quality

1418
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
we will see later

1419
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I will push and add a fun one for you to see

1420
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
remind me

1421
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Next, let's talk about the teacher

1422
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
that means let's go and see

1423
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Educate your diversion about a person

1424
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
What is the effect

1425
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
You see it's like a high school

1426
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
15 18 22

1427
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
This is a vocational college graduate

1428
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
they are practicing

1429
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
This group has always had the highest

1430
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Has grown up

1431
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Then this is high school

1432
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,760
He only went to high school and didn't continue

1433
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,860
You see he seems to be happy

1434
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,720
But at 22 he's a little nervous

1435
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,700
Graduating from high school is somewhat different from graduating from higher vocational education in the job market

1436
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,840
Because your training human capital is not the same

1437
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,540
University of Science and Technology

1438
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,100
Technological universities are arguably doing well

1439
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,260
He's a little lower, a little lower all the way

1440
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,740
what about university

1441
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:27,100
He's here, if you're a senior

1442
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,700
He was tallest when he was 15

1443
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,200
At the age of 18 is also the highest

1444
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,040
At the age of 20, it is still quite tall, like high school

1445
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,060
But after you turned 24, did you notice him?

1446
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,540
rapid descent

1447
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,260
Of course they have a commergence

1448
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:42,140
But at least he is the most descended

1449
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,140
Then let's say, let's see if there is any difference in the region

1450
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:48,500
Red is Taipei Line

1451
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,140
Is it a bit like a high school?

1452
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:51,940
that feeling

1453
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:55,040
That Taipei City is this blue

1454
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,600
At first it seemed that Yilan was the happiest

1455
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,040
Just a little nervous at 20

1456
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
to be honest

1457
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
when i was getting ready i really felt

1458
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
In 20 years, I really don't know more than I know

1459
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
There are always questions coming out, I really don't know

1460
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
what's up with this 20 year old

1461
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
i still don't know

1462
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
so really sorry

1463
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I hope that someone will continue to study in the future

1464
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
But you see that Yilan is really

1465
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
quality of life will be better

1466
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
So this thing makes us think

1467
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Could it have something to do with the structure of his family?

1468
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
family's structural capital

1469
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
As far as we found out, this blue one is

1470
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Dad has a college degree or above

1471
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Good shape

1472
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
dad didn't

1473
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
You see, dad doesn't actually have

1474
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
always lower, right?

1475
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Especially in the 1920's it was obvious

1476
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
But at the age of 22

1477
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
The effect of the family's resources appears

1478
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
when you apply for a job

1479
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
You will find that you have a father who is more educated

1480
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
he can discuss with you

1481
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I can tell you some things

1482
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
It's different from nothing

1483
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,200
What about family relations?

1484
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,000
The blue one is a good family relationship

1485
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,600
The red color means that the family relationship is relatively bad.

1486
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:10,500
As long as it is a bad relationship, it goes all the way and gets bigger and bigger.

1487
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,300
It's because this study made me think of saying

1488
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:16,800
Although Yuyu's overall status and the two entrance exams correspond to each other

1489
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,700
There is an obvious educational diversion effect

1490
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,700
But the family vein has its double effect

1491
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,900
Appears in middle school and early adulthood

1492
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,700
and as it stands

1493
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,500
like family relationship

1494
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,100
more pronounced than family structure

1495
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,800
We are here if you are interested in this

1496
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,900
welcome a lot of research

1497
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,000
Because these materials have been released

1498
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,600
Anyone can go online to do academic research

1499
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,100
The growth trajectory of the school is obvious

1500
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,700
has a long-term effect on

1501
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,200
ok so here we go

1502
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:50,500
I'll go on to say that sociologists care more about the underprivileged

1503
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,300
among our vulnerable

1504
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,400
We have a set of questions that if you are interviewed here

1505
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,500
This is all about deviant behavior

1506
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,700
So I ask the current Taipei University

1507
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,800
Head of Department of Social Studies Chen Yifu

1508
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,720
He was our first generation research assistant

1509
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,080
So he went for three weeks

1510
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,280
all week all weekend

1511
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,200
Just keep writing back and forth with me

1512
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,320
So this result is hot

1513
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,720
Everyone can take a look

1514
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,800
we care about the disadvantaged

1515
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,040
We also want to see from this

1516
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,720
What is the multi-development model?

1517
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,680
Then if you say deviant behavior

1518
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,720
is a body indicator

1519
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,240
so-called depressive symptoms

1520
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,640
It's a psychological indicator

1521
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,120
Is there any correlation between these two indicators?

1522
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,920
Here's what we all want to know

1523
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,600
right

1524
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,280
someone nodded

1525
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,480
Come on, let's take a look

1526
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,720
Indicators of our biased behavior

1527
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,400
Probably these ten

1528
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,200
result

1529
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,880
Melancholy, he used it from the age of 13 to the age of 18

1530
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,280
It was found that four groups can be distinguished

1531
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,080
come everybody

1532
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,360
this

1533
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,400
This is called the highest

1534
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:57,960
About 9.2% of him are tall all the way

1535
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,840
lowest here

1536
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,500
The lowest is of course the most

1537
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,500
he is always the lowest

1538
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,000
Turns out jumping a little bit at 15 when it was stressful

1539
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,500
less obvious jump

1540
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,000
Another group of people in the literature

1541
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
The literature will also tell you

1542
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,500
He's going to have a flare-up in his mid-teens

1543
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,000
so parents don't be nervous

1544
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,500
22% of this group of people

1545
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,000
In his 15-year-old burst he fell again

1546
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
So this group of people is normal

1547
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Taiwan is different from Europe and the United States

1548
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,500
That is to recall what I just said

1549
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:28,500
A whole bunch of us showing up another set

1550
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:32,500
Blue will rise to the group at the age of 15 and 18

1551
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,500
I think this is really

1552
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,500
Related to our educational diversion

1553
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,500
He is always there

1554
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,000
under pressure

1555
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,500
Some say he is 30 years old

1556
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,500
I dreamed that he was taking an exam

1557
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,500
so many years

1558
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,500
so you can see

1559
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,500
This is with Mofit

1560
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,500
His theory of deviant development is the same

1561
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,500
It's just that we have one more in Taiwan

1562
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,500
Deviation

1563
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,500
so i want to say

1564
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,000
Then I see these four groups of people

1565
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
how about his depression

1566
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,500
Of course this thing is all the way up

1567
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,500
he is depressed

1568
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
But in the end, there is not much difference

1569
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
did you notice

1570
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
That group is what I'm talking about

1571
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Nervous when the face is good

1572
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
This green is only once

1573
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
This is relatively low

1574
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
no matter who you are at 15

1575
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
all very nervous

1576
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
So the pressure of our high school entrance examination

1577
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
We also talked about it last time

1578
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
It is much more stressful than going to college

1579
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
So this is his 19 to 30 years old

1580
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
You can see a little bump here

1581
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
But then converge again

1582
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
little difference

1583
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
So overall

1584
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
You can see this line is very obvious

1585
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
We follow this wave all the way

1586
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
It's their link

1587
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
follow all the way

1588
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
You can see this time low down

1589
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
go up again

1590
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
this time at the age of 20

1591
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
This is the group I'm talking about

1592
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Our special groups in Taiwan

1593
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
He was very tall when he was 20 years old

1594
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
then to the back

1595
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Everyone is connected again

1596
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
so i'm interested

1597
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I said okay don't let me take a look

1598
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
these four groups of people

1599
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
After we control all the disguises

1600
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Is this disguise still obvious?

1601
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Then I present these salient

1602
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
show you please watch this

1603
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
It is the 9.2% just mentioned

1604
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
The group with the highest deviant behavior all the way

1605
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Indeed, there are many boys

1606
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
He is likely to come from a single-parent family

1607
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
His highest education is lower than others, right?

1608
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Very high frequency of smoking

1609
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
GPC we ask you how many packs you smoke a day, etc.

1610
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
The question is very detailed, just to do some research

1611
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
And the frequency of drinking is also higher than others

1612
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
But is he the same as that

1613
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
his traditional gender role he is extra tall

1614
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
It's more conservative. He will be more conservative.

1615
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
He is conservative in many views

1616
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Although he has a high level of deviant behavior

1617
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
In fact, his attitude is relatively conservative.

1618
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
do you feel depressed

1619
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Actually not working class

1620
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Also more conservative than white-collar workers

1621
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
This is certain at this time

1622
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
All countries in the world are like this

1623
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Okay, next family drama

1624
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
He was so low back then that's why he had all sorts of deviant behavior

1625
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Performance

1626
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Friends support, probably no one particularly likes this kind of person

1627
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,600
So he is also very low

1628
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Married or not, of course not as good as this group

1629
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
But I was very depressed and found that this is a very significant high

1630
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
He's most likely to start a business when he's 31

1631
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And he earns more than all of them

1632
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I'm relieved after we finally got this result the night before...

1633
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Otherwise, I don't know how to tell you

1634
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,000
So I'm going to tell you that after the high deviance group enters adulthood,

1635
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
On the contrary, his entrepreneurship and his income are the highest

1636
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
So you need to know this

1637
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
He's because of his high biased orientation

1638
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
So his explosive power will be different

1639
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
So we are doing a very preliminary analysis of this thing now.

1640
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
control a bunch of necessary disguises

1641
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
It is also possible to obtain such remarkable results

1642
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
we have to prove it for him

1643
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:59,000
So next, some of our colleagues will do adult education and employment

1644
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
School to Work Transition

1645
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
This seems to be a very popular topic in the world

1646
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Then our diversion is very similar to Germany

1647
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
But it's not the same

1648
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
When we were 15 years old, were we divided into high school and high school?

1649
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
then divide later

1650
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
that's for us

1651
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
We also have some special localization considerations

1652
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
then we also want to know

1653
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
How is educational achievement related generationally

1654
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
School qualifications, occupations, etc.

1655
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
so what

1656
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
ok please take a look

1657
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
At the age of 31, our batch of samples

1658
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
The actual degree is like this

1659
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
most are college graduates

1660
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Graduated from a junior college Graduated from a vocational school

1661
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Master's degree is very high

1662
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Because now it's like a master's class

1663
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
More open to young people to read

1664
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
we just say to us today

1665
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
take a look

1666
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
when he was 15 or 18

1667
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
we all asked a question

1668
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
How high of a degree do you hope you can study in the future?

1669
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
ok you can see

1670
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,540
When I graduated from junior high school at the age of 15

1671
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,660
Many people say that I will study until I graduate from a vocational school

1672
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:04,500
Do you have

1673
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,540
But when he was 18, he stopped talking like that.

1674
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,660
But at the age of 31

1675
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:12,160
The real degree is slightly higher

1676
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,460
Because maybe he missed

1677
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:15,900
master's degree

1678
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,040
However, some subjective and objective conditions may not be able to match

1679
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,600
so he moved up a little bit

1680
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,060
so let's see

1681
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:26,060
Therefore, the educator expects educational achievements similar to his own

1682
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:28,400
We still have parents' educational expectations

1683
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,900
There are also teacher's educational expectations

1684
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:33,400
Teachers and parents are quite converged

1685
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,040
We also remember the children in Yilan

1686
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:39,240
When I was in Guoyi, I was very happy that the volume chain was very high

1687
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,900
When he was in third grade, he would return to a comparison

1688
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,200
some practical expectations

1689
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,440
so to speak

1690
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,200
good

1691
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,840
what's next

1692
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:52,000
Let's ask Professor Liu to take a look

1693
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,040
What is the background profile of this sample?

1694
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,340
About 38% are married

1695
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:59,340
23% have given birth

1696
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:00,080
i am surprised

1697
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,900
32-year-olds think they are in normal health

1698
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,000
I don't know why

1699
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,200
i thought i should be happy

1700
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,200
may be really ordinary

1701
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,700
That

1702
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,800
Then the father's family background

1703
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,900
Father's college degree or above is 24

1704
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,100
Compared with the 70s we see now

1705
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,500
It's a big difference

1706
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,500
so here

1707
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:23,100
This upward mobility in education is very evident

1708
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:26,500
Then their income on average is like this

1709
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,400
there are people in management

1710
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,900
probably the same

1711
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,500
So

1712
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:35,500
The average number of years of schooling is 15.7

1713
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:36,500
That

1714
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:37,700
come and see this

1715
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:38,500
this is faster

1716
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,800
About 70% of people are employed

1717
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:44,500
But you need to know that the average company size is 3.5

1718
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,300
so really small business

1719
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,000
Most of them are working in small companies.

1720
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,700
Not the TSMC you think of

1721
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:51,900
absolutely not

1722
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:53,400
probably so

1723
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:53,900
good

1724
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,000
so what

1725
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
By gender you can see

1726
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,800
If we divide it into four categories

1727
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,000
This top national

1728
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,600
It is the classification of the ten schools listed by the Ministry of Education

1729
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,980
Because I said that Taiwan is more interested in this

1730
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:09,640
Knowing that their final education is connected with his employment one by one

1731
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,920
You see it is probably like this below the junior college level

1732
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,760
males are higher than females

1733
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,260
most at private colleges

1734
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,080
This is no problem, probably everyone agrees

1735
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:22,520
The average national university here is a little less than the top university

1736
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,920
If the achievement of Fujing education

1737
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,640
The revival itself is below the specialist level

1738
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,960
This child is more likely to have only a junior college or below

1739
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,600
or a private university

1740
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,200
But if Fuxing has a college degree or above

1741
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,720
he is in national university

1742
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,920
You can see that compared to him, he will be obviously taller.

1743
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:46,480
So that's what we're talking about with shoulder flow

1744
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:49,640
This is the most basic one-by-one association

1745
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,760
mother too

1746
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,760
Then if you divide it again, you can see

1747
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:57,400
Taipei is a national university and top universities

1748
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,520
It is higher than Taipei and Yilan

1749
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,760
Taipei Line and Yilan can only be read in the language of colleges and universities

1750
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,160
The proportion of those who did not study college is higher than that of Taipei City

1751
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,560
Regional differences exist

1752
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,560
The distribution of educational resources is not the same

1753
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,240
So in the end we agreed

1754
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,760
Then let's see how your school and your labor market are doing.

1755
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,760
We take private universities

1756
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,920
More than half of the people are studying in private universities as a reference group

1757
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,640
Compared with him, those who did not go to university in college language

1758
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,440
Compared with him, those who study in National University

1759
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,920
Those who go to top universities can compare with him

1760
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,920
Then empty out a lot of stuff

1761
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,200
Discover Top National Universities for People

1762
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,080
It is more likely that the monthly salary is higher than that of private universities

1763
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,480
Gao Gao, this is the proof

1764
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,000
then this is about

1765
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,560
National universities can have about 4% more

1766
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,600
And top universities can even reach

1767
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,120
Twenty-two percent is 2 percent better than private universities

1768
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,600
It's the same with the salary and the management class is interesting

1769
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,680
you'll find out you don't go to college

1770
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,600
and only national university students

1771
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,000
with private university

1772
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,780
less likely to be a manager

1773
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:05,780
Do you understand me?

1774
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:07,380
If you are studying at a private university

1775
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:08,980
you don't go to college

1776
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:10,980
And those who study in general state universities

1777
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:12,980
More opportunities to be a manager

1778
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:15,480
But if the job is satisfactory

1779
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,980
Compared with private universities

1780
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:19,280
this person is satisfied

1781
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,280
he didn't go to college

1782
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,480
he's having fun too

1783
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,480
But with that national university

1784
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:24,980
For top thousand universities

1785
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,980
Everyone is more satisfied than him

1786
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,980
What does this mean

1787
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,980
family forced better

1788
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:33,980
Higher chances of entering national universities

1789
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:35,980
this is what we've all been

1790
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,980
Repeated lectures on various educational research

1791
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:40,980
And the salary after graduating from national university

1792
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:41,980
is relatively high

1793
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:42,980
Do you have

1794
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,980
This is not a problem

1795
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:47,980
so high tuition

1796
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:48,980
this subsidy policy

1797
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,980
Maybe it's really poor people who make up for it

1798
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:51,980
rich man

1799
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:53,980
This is indeed a concern

1800
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:55,980
the other one

1801
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,980
This is a person from a private university

1802
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,980
percentage of his managerial positions

1803
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
is relatively high

1804
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,500
But he's not in a management position in a big company

1805
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,000
So his salary is not high or low

1806
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
and lower job satisfaction

1807
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,500
so you know what I mean, right?

1808
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,000
Then come and see

1809
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
His management experience will affect his future promotion

1810
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,500
Competing with his debts with others

1811
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,000
how will it develop

1812
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I really want to see you again

1813
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Only ten years later will we really know

1814
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,500
But that is to say, it can be seen that for us in Taiwan

1815
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:30,500
When we divide it into private colleges most people practice

1816
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,000
General National Universities vs. Top Universities

1817
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,500
You can see his way out is different

1818
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,000
So this article is mainly about this

1819
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
That's the last topic

1820
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Marriage and childbirth of the younger generation

1821
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
We have this issue of premarital sex and cohabitation

1822
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:52,000
In fact, TYP may also be the first in Taiwan to do research

1823
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,500
Because these self-administered questionnaires

1824
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Ask some intimate questions about our sealed questionnaire

1825
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
that's because of these

1826
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
These samples have been with us for more than ten years

1827
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
So he should have some trust in us

1828
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
So they can fill out some smuggling questions themselves

1829
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
then we also want to know

1830
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
How does it affect the degree of marital satisfaction of married young couples

1831
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Then let me show you the status of the marriage.

1832
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
about the information we collect

1833
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
simply speaking

1834
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
7% married by age 25

1835
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
20% at age 28

1836
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
40% by 2017

1837
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I just said that it is consistent with the government's data

1838
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Let's count the number of people who got married

1839
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Probably using the government's ratio to calculate, there is only a difference of five or six.

1840
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
So there is 60%

1841
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Still unmarried at an average age of 31

1842
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
So

1843
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
So the younger generation has premarital sex

1844
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
let's just say when did you start

1845
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
when was the first time

1846
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
let's ask this question first

1847
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Then want to know how your family and peers influence you

1848
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
that with or without premarital sex

1849
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
What is its long-term effect

1850
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
We have a group of colleagues who are very concerned about this topic

1851
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Then the individual and various contextual factors

1852
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
It is also what we want to discuss, explain and clarify

1853
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Then this is a one-off survey.

1854
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
For example, our 2017

1855
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Let's just say have you ever had premarital sex?

1856
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Then you will probably find that there are so many

1857
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
That is to say, you can see that the jump is very fast.

1858
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Then I will ask our assistant to do it this afternoon.

1859
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Because 60% of us are not married, right?

1860
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Among these unmarried samples

1861
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,000
How did his sexual relationship, premarital intimacy develop?

1862
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
you can see it

1863
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
We had a group ask him how many of you have never had a boyfriend or girlfriend

1864
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
There are 302

1865
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
There are almost men and women here

1866
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Have you never had sex before?

1867
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
girls taller

1868
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
So is this group of nerds and nerds in our hearts?

1869
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,600
31 years old never handed in never nothing

1870
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,160
sexual experience

1871
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,700
so we went to see him

1872
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:12,040
The effect of the context and the effect of the peers are found

1873
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,100
If you are in school itself is a protection

1874
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,440
if you have community involvement you will lower your voice rate

1875
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:22,280
But if you're dating or have we asked you to mention

1876
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:26,380
Do you think your good friend has premarital sex? Some people talk about good friends without talking about themselves

1877
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:29,440
Those who have good friends are more likely to happen.

1878
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,260
So he thinks he is serious

1879
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:33,800
Then we can see

1880
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:38,660
Therefore, the experience of premarital sex and cohabitation does increase premarital restoration and early marriage

1881
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:41,720
This is the research just done on behalf of Professor Tweety

1882
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,540
Then I'll tell you something funny

1883
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:49,400
We have a very talented colleague who unfortunately left academia Mr. Li Ruizhong

1884
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:53,240
When he came to join our group, he said he was going to do a lab problem

1885
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,060
In this experiment, one is five questions, and the other is one more question.

1886
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:58,880
It can be seen from that question

1887
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,320
did he have premarital sex

1888
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,000
As a result, I found that the experimental results of males are about 22 and 3

1889
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
female is 35

1890
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
But when our research report asked him to self-report

1891
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
46 for men and 33 for women

1892
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Women's experiments are very similar to self-reports

1893
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Boys will touch, right?

1894
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Because he has some peer pressure, right?

1895
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
i think this is so funny

1896
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I didn't even think they should be 20 years old at that time

1897
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
is it 22

1898
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
i don't know i was at the time

1899
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
I think this is so interesting

1900
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
It's a pity I didn't write it out

1901
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I think this thing is still very interesting

1902
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Although men have about 2.1 times the

1903
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
will explode his incidence rate

1904
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
But the female way of reporting is more reliable.

1905
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
So you get what I mean

1906
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
this is fun

1907
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Okay, I'm going to be Professor Yang Wenshan next.

1908
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Also our mortal colleagues

1909
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
cohabitation experience

1910
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
His topic is very clear

1911
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
What is the general rate of cohabitation?

1912
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
What is his staged development?

1913
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
between gender and education

1914
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,440
Does the difference matter

1915
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,780
Because we talked about premarital sex just now

1916
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:04,940
you learn again

1917
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:07,880
In fact, no longer learn to enter the social work

1918
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,280
Less likely to have premarital sex

1919
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:12,920
So school seems to be a protective factor

1920
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:16,120
what about cohabitation

1921
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:19,560
He tracked all the way from the age of 24 to 34

1922
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,700
Cumulative distance of cohabitation

1923
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:22,960
everyone can see

1924
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,600
at the age of 24

1925
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,160
About 6% for men

1926
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,200
7% for women

1927
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,360
slowly

1928
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,800
By the time of 27 28

1929
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,500
women are even slightly taller

1930
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,200
right

1931
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,140
but in the end

1932
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:35,140
Men will be higher than women

1933
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:36,940
This is traced all the way down

1934
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:39,680
cumulative cohabitation rate

1935
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,580
If you use this to see

1936
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:43,240
You can see about half of what didn't happen

1937
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,580
that this has happened

1938
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:45,940
women than men

1939
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:46,780
women are red

1940
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:47,620
slightly higher

1941
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:48,860
but later on

1942
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:49,980
until the age of 4

1943
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:53,220
male taller

1944
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:55,100
Then look at his

1945
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,220
education level

1946
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:58,320
in the case of

1947
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,560
below high school

1948
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,700
college and university

1949
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:05,900
You will find that the less educated the more likely

1950
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:08,060
There is a chance of this cohabitation

1951
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,460
But after college

1952
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:12,400
The difference between men and women is not that big

1953
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,000
On the gender difference

1954
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,800
There are gender differences between men and women beyond college

1955
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,200
not so big

1956
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,800
So overall

1957
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,200
Our current young generation in Taiwan

1958
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,160
What is premarital intimacy really like?

1959
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:28,160
I think premarital sex is fairly common

1960
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,200
young adult

1961
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,760
About 80% said he had this experience

1962
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,240
while studying or not

1963
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,560
There is also a significant influence of peers

1964
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:39,440
Second cohabitation is going up with age

1965
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,640
About 50% said they had lived together

1966
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,940
males outnumber females

1967
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:47,100
while the lower degree of university sex

1968
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,660
People with a university degree will be lower

1969
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:50,700
Then the sex difference will also decrease

1970
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,800
So if this thing gives us an inspiration

1971
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:57,000
As far as we're talking about marriage, it's obvious

1972
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,840
Not for lack of intimacy

1973
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:00,040
but other economic

1974
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
social considerations

1975
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
So I'm going to tell you

1976
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Some of the results we found with the directization study

1977
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
but there is one

1978
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
One thing I find interesting is

1979
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
60% of unmarried

1980
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Nearly no intercourse Asexual relationship

1981
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
This batch of slaughtering women is really worth noting

1982
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Because her number is not so small

1983
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
good

1984
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Over the years we have

1985
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I've been doing sex interviews

1986
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
There are early marriages and ordinary marriages

1987
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
unmarried

1988
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Let's talk about early marriage and low education

1989
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
and may have cohabitation experience

1990
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
so straight interview

1991
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
We are in April this year

1992
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
also reported last year

1993
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
What are the factors that affect early marriage

1994
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
can be roughly divided into three categories

1995
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Xiao Zhi I don't miss you see for yourself

1996
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Poor family relationship

1997
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
That means she doesn't have a good relationship with her previous generation of parents.

1998
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
or the relationship between the parents

1999
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
What we just said affects

2000
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
and native family

2001
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
bad economic situation

2002
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
so through marriage

2003
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
escape from family of origin

2004
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
This is the first one I mentioned just now

2005
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
avoid or need a

2006
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
A relationship is put in it

2007
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
The other is the influence of traditional cultural norms

2008
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
especially married by decree

2009
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Or want to have children before getting married

2010
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
or have lived together for a long time

2011
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Parents tell him to legalize

2012
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
finally i saw one

2013
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I think it's normal

2014
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
impulse to love

2015
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
right

2016
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
also have

2017
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
At that time, when I fell in love to a certain extent, I wanted to get married.

2018
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
You'd feel like seeing a marriage like this

2019
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
just breathed a sigh of relief

2020
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
this is a comparison

2021
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Everyone will feel more

2022
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
result of relaxation

2023
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
so unmarried

2024
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
we are now in

2025
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
reasons for engaging in unmarried

2026
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Probably can be divided into several

2027
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
just now we said

2028
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
This is because traditional norms influence

2029
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
right

2030
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
you were married by decree

2031
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
or how

2032
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
but in this place

2033
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
It is also to challenge the traditional culture

2034
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
i don't want to get married

2035
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
can also support yourself

2036
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I don't want to

2037
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
offspring to marry

2038
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
so he wants to be unmarried

2039
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,620
The second one has a poor relationship with the original family

2040
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:04,500
Especially the relationship between parents

2041
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:08,620
Ladies and gentlemen, this coincides with the love study I just talked about.

2042
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,620
If there is conflict between parent and child

2043
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:13,820
Instead, he'll seek marriage and run away from the family.

2044
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:17,620
When witnessing conflict between parents, especially as a teenager

2045
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:19,700
often lowers him to get married

2046
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:23,060
Some thoughts on starting a family or having children

2047
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:28,900
So our straightening and brightening here is completely consistent with the

2048
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,800
There are several other reasons

2049
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,500
Lack of incentives to enter married life

2050
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:37,300
I've been thinking about this for a long time, what should I do?

2051
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:39,700
and feelings that value stable relationships

2052
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:41,100
better than getting married

2053
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:44,000
Often he says he already has this partner

2054
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,800
Seven years, eight years, nine years, ten years

2055
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,400
just never thought of getting married

2056
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,700
This is quite common among young people in Taiwan

2057
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,800
Or married life is not free

2058
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,100
The marriage process is fast and troublesome

2059
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:56,100
we'll be fine

2060
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,500
How many people will there be

2061
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,700
how much influence will he have

2062
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Must wait until even we go to visit

2063
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Several people said that they were supposed to be pregnant.

2064
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
that must be married

2065
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Then you are not pregnant yet

2066
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
So the wedding package still exists

2067
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
There are also people who are more obvious

2068
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Not many people are usually willing to say this

2069
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
because we even in quantitative research

2070
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
what do you think your ideal partner is

2071
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
will check the economic clear

2072
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Whatever condition is good is not the highest

2073
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
We all get along and talk like this

2074
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I think it's not easy to talk all the time in marriage

2075
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Another one is

2076
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
He said that his love experience and dating partner are not suitable

2077
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
or a bad love experience

2078
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Or he thinks the partner is not suitable for marriage

2079
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
only good for friends

2080
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
But on the other hand we see

2081
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
It was also stated in these interviews

2082
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
i will get married in a year or two

2083
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
ask him why

2084
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
He said it was because I was of marriageable age

2085
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
So I think we actually have a chance

2086
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
to think young

2087
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
what is the marriageable age

2088
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
we asked some questions

2089
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,680
At what age do you think you should get married

2090
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:05,000
at what age should we start a family

2091
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,280
When he found out that he was 25 years old, he said 28

2092
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,920
When he was 28, he said 32

2093
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,160
just go all the way back

2094
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,840
This is also very honest

2095
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,240
Because it's over, what do you want?

2096
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:14,920
so say

2097
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,320
But the social norm of starting a family

2098
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:18,640
does still exist

2099
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,760
So the last subtitle

2100
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,120
I told everyone

2101
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,520
marital satisfaction for young couples

2102
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,120
because we have now spoken

2103
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,680
40% of people are married

2104
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,600
Among the 31-year-old married people

2105
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,920
Of course this includes his age of 25 and 28

2106
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,520
all married people

2107
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:38,520
their marriage is happy

2108
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:41,600
what kind of influence

2109
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,760
Will it be the same as before

2110
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:44,800
you thought you said the same

2111
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,080
You should be satisfied with Ike Arikawa

2112
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:48,760
what do they think

2113
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,640
so what do i think about this thing

2114
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:54,400
We just want to see it from different sides

2115
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,160
Then this article will also be published in October

2116
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,160
simply speaking

2117
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,840
If you were to explain marital satisfaction

2118
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,160
Like I said, there are too many times

2119
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:05,440
It is really difficult to try my best to get rid of the pure scriptures

2120
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,640
Too many life stages are a thing

2121
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:12,560
On the psychological level, your mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in childhood are all here

2122
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,040
personal reason

2123
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,760
Family Economic Factors This is a set

2124
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,480
In addition, you can say that relational factors

2125
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:22,840
For example, if there is a lack of communication between newlyweds

2126
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,360
Poor relationship between parent and adult child

2127
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:29,880
This will affect the marital satisfaction of young couples

2128
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:33,680
In addition, many people in the West do gender role attitudes

2129
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:35,880
think a person if gender role attitudes

2130
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,640
Believe that men and women should be more equal

2131
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,760
the better his marriage

2132
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:43,320
But on the other hand, it is also found that husbands and wives compare

2133
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:47,560
If the wife has higher gender role attitudes than the husband

2134
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:52,000
More equality is more detrimental to marriage satisfaction

2135
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,160
This goes back to the structural differences we talk about in sociology

2136
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,960
This is an attitude difference

2137
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,920
If there is too much difference between husband and wife

2138
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,080
Usually he is not easy

2139
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
easy to produce good results

2140
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
What's the difference between east and west

2141
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
The West will refer to research in recent years

2142
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
will speak between spouses

2143
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
The importance of family factors

2144
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
think marital relationship

2145
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Husbands and wives feel differently

2146
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
you can't just use one person

2147
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
so we are lucky

2148
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
We ask the master sample again

2149
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
asked his spouse

2150
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
on the same topic

2151
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
The two of them can have different answers

2152
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
in addition

2153
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
There are also differences in resources between husbands

2154
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
There are also differences in the feeling of marriage relationship

2155
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
it's all western research

2156
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
tell us what we should pay attention to

2157
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
But in our Eastern social context

2158
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
our patrilineal society

2159
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Marriage was never a matter of two young people

2160
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
it is a union of two families

2161
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
So our previous

2162
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
not talking about marriage

2163
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
It's about marrying a daughter-in-law

2164
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
marry a wife because

2165
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Are you going to take a female

2166
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
marry into this family

2167
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Then in this cultural context

2168
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
The relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is a good study

2169
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
We are in this year's survey of seniors

2170
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,500
We'll do some questions specifically on this

2171
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:08,000
Then exchange relatives with the three generations of the same family, etc.

2172
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,500
Simply put, our argument is

2173
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:16,420
The current family system in Taiwan is a modified

2174
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:18,000
matriarchal family system

2175
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:23,000
In this system, cultural norms follow the genealogy of whether you are husband or wife

2176
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,500
is very important

2177
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:29,500
Therefore, the direct interaction must include structural relations and normative aspects.

2178
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:33,500
Study on the Core Keys of Marriage Satisfaction in Taiwan

2179
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:37,500
In fact, raising it a level or two is to ask this sentence

2180
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:42,000
Does Feminine Culture Persist? Or Has It Changed?

2181
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,500
So if a marriage is not two parties but a union of two families

2182
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:51,500
Then marital satisfaction is not a feeling between two people

2183
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:57,500
It involves different inputs between the family level and the network of relatives and friends

2184
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:00,500
OK, so we use

2185
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,600
2014 and 2015 Spouse Survey

2186
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:05,160
As a result, this thing may not be seen

2187
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,100
But basically a happy marriage

2188
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:08,700
Everyone is satisfied

2189
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:10,600
So this means that you and

2190
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,900
Mother-in-law relationship or relationship with parents-in-law

2191
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,900
You can see it roughly here

2192
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,600
Then we also constructed

2193
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,000
Did you live with your parents after you got married?

2194
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,100
with my husband a lot

2195
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:23,300
Then the second is to live separately

2196
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:25,000
The third is the right way

2197
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,200
Also this thing took some effort

2198
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,300
we bring them to exchange

2199
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:33,300
In financial terms

2200
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:34,400
one is equal

2201
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,500
one is western

2202
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,900
one is partial husband

2203
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:37,800
result

2204
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,600
We take the whole model

2205
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,000
Divided into two categories of self-disguised phases

2206
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,700
The first category is called resources

2207
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:46,900
that includes these

2208
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,000
family income etc.

2209
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,300
Wife is more educated

2210
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:51,000
Spouses are separated by resources

2211
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,300
The other category we call cultural norms

2212
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:56,200
you can see it here

2213
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:58,300
Cultural norms have to live with

2214
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:00,100
There is a yin and qing relationship and a connection

2215
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
exchange etc.

2216
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
you can see the wife is affected

2217
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
very big

2218
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I list the notable ones

2219
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
not listed

2220
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
It also affects the husband

2221
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
For example, living with the husband

2222
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Husbands who live apart are more satisfied

2223
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
but the interesting thing is

2224
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Compared with living with Husband Fang

2225
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
the few who live with their wives

2226
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
it's less

2227
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
The wife is dissatisfied

2228
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
so again

2229
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I found that at different stages

2230
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
unconventional atypical arrangement

2231
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
often lead to negative effects

2232
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
This quantitative research can be said here

2233
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Why

2234
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
May need some straightforward additions

2235
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
on the other hand

2236
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
we found westward

2237
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
yes can bring some benefits

2238
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
but negative relationship

2239
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
very important

2240
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Husband thinks he is with

2241
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
The more women get along with the mother

2242
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
have some pressure

2243
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
or when he feels less than ideal

2244
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
he is

2245
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
no matter husband or wife

2246
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
are equally affected

2247
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
But for the wife

2248
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,900
When he has problems with his in-laws

2249
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,900
he will be affected

2250
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,600
So the conclusion of this study

2251
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:07,700
just tell us

2252
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:09,500
Let's look at it theoretically

2253
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:12,000
Actually resources and cultural norms

2254
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,600
will have an important impact

2255
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,500
And we are doing some further analysis

2256
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,200
I didn't release it here

2257
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:21,300
That is, the cultural norm is that wives are happy in marriage.

2258
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:22,400
I just said

2259
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,500
it makes a big impact

2260
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:26,800
However, if we further de-interact

2261
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,700
It was discovered that she was living with her husband's parents

2262
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:32,100
And she's a full-time working wife

2263
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,600
The most obvious impact

2264
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,100
It is most likely to have negative effects

2265
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:37,200
That's it

2266
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,600
So if the wife here is working full time

2267
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,300
Because I live with my husband's parents

2268
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:43,800
Pay more attention to give more support

2269
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,200
Then if the husband feels negative

2270
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:49,100
Negative relationship will lead to both husband and wife

2271
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:51,700
Negative Effects of Marital Satisfaction

2272
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:54,100
So what is the reflection of this thing for me?

2273
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:55,200
Taiwanese family

2274
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,300
In fact, many places are still traditional

2275
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,300
The impact with the modern

2276
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:00,100
pick there

2277
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,320
and compromise and make some responses

2278
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:05,920
because of our values

2279
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,320
some of our actions are continuous

2280
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,400
some are constant

2281
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,760
So if Taiwan still has an East Asian society

2282
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,960
We are different from Europe and the United States

2283
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:18,320
because you study a family in transition

2284
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,960
Needs to go beyond your interpretation of personal resources

2285
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:25,200
The interaction of cultural norms should also be considered

2286
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,440
I also believe that this is our social science community in Taiwan.

2287
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:31,640
Family studies can be done internationally in academia

2288
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:34,040
where you can make a little contribution

2289
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:38,160
Because instead of just applying some western theories

2290
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:39,680
resource theory

2291
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:41,360
what kind of resources

2292
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:44,320
When we add the importance of cultural norms

2293
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,480
they will find

2294
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:48,160
At least in this large area with a large population

2295
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:49,880
it's very important

2296
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,680
There are already so many slopes in our current data release

2297
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:58,040
Welcome everyone to apply with the research office to use

2298
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
20 years

2299
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Then we also published two books in English

2300
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Now our second English book

2301
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
in preparation probably there will be

2302
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
16 to 18 papers for Phase 2 results

2303
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
then in the end i was

2304
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
thank you very much

2305
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
most grateful

2306
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
They are all samples of our young people

2307
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
They are willing to continue to be us

2308
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
visit for more than an hour every time

2309
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
200 yuan

2310
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Very sorry

2311
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Then

2312
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
and our parents

2313
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Especially this year we are going to

2314
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Sixth Wave 62-Year-Old Parents Study

2315
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I don't know how many parents

2316
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
willing to answer

2317
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
But at least in the first five waves

2318
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
we are very grateful to them

2319
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
then this year we will try

2320
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
That is, outside of one of the parents

2321
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
another one

2322
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
We also do a short roll of visits

2323
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
hope that the relationship between parents

2324
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
problems condensed together

2325
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
The teacher and principal of the junior high school

2326
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Especially middle school teachers

2327
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
can you imagine

2328
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
I took the entrance exam in July and June

2329
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
September asked him what his test score was

2330
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
He told you to forget

2331
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Fortunately, we asked the teacher

2332
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,160
teachers have records

2333
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,600
So we use the teacher

2334
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,600
So these kids are very prosperous

2335
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,800
Then, I really want to thank these principals

2336
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,300
Except for one, he said he had a heart for the job, and he didn't answer.

2337
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:14,100
In fact, each of his principals is interested in community resources.

2338
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:16,300
How does the school respond to these needs?

2339
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,400
Give us some good information

2340
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:23,000
We are also very grateful to all the guides and interviewers

2341
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,800
I think there is something in it today

2342
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,700
This is a special thank you to everyone

2343
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:29,900
If it weren't for you to go this way one by one

2344
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:33,000
If you look at it, we have too many messages and can’t do it

2345
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,300
it's really not easy

2346
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:39,000
Moreover, our guides and interviewers are carefully selected.

2347
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,200
special thanks

2348
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:43,200
We also thank all participating research colleagues

2349
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,600
There are quite a few of them today

2350
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,900
There are people before and after us

2351
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,900
Especially our former and former research assistants

2352
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:51,000
with all our postdocs

2353
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,500
We originally said that from the first generation

2354
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:55,700
How many generations of research assistants have there been

2355
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:58,500
We're all going from middle age to old age too.

2356
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:00,500
We would like to thank the Chinese

2357
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,600
Deputy Director Nakazonozono

2358
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:03,720
There are also social institutes

2359
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,800
Especially the administrative colleagues are too busy to help

2360
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:06,640
such a big study

2361
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:09,080
You can imagine how complicated he is

2362
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:12,040
The Ministry of Science and Technology of the National Science Council has also supported it all the way to this day

2363
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,480
thank you all

2364
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,320
Thank you very much Professor Ying

2365
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:27,200
very brilliant and interesting research

2366
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:31,440
Absolutely worthy of our hospital's strong support

2367
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,680
what about now

2368
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:36,840
We will open this time to all listeners

2369
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:40,600
Let's see if you have any questions

2370
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,880
We are now open to everyone

2371
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:00,000
ok sir

2372
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:00,800
Come on

2373
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,000
ask the professor

2374
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,500
The new syllabus we are now implementing

2375
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:09,300
Right, starting this year

2376
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:12,100
a child of christ

2377
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:13,500
and adult

2378
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:15,100
parents

2379
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:16,400
do grandparents

2380
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,600
How to express the country's new curriculum

2381
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:22,500
Empower children to compete in entering

2382
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:23,500
Won't

2383
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:24,700
Lack

2384
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:25,500
Thanks

2385
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,800
You're younger and I can't get mad

2386
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:34,800
besides

2387
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:37,600
Collect some topics together

2388
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:40,300
Let Professor Ying answer him together

2389
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,300
Are there any other questions?

2390
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:44,500
Will it make a difference for me to say that?

2391
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:49,900
Okay, thank you

2392
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,600
This question about the new syllabus

2393
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,400
because it happened in recent years

2394
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:56,200
We did it in 2000

2395
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:58,000
So at that time for us it was

2396
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
From joint examination system to

2397
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,680
partial application

2398
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:04,360
So education reform attendance is in that place

2399
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:06,600
so we didn't touch the new syllabus

2400
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:07,800
should say like this

2401
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:10,440
It should be said that the advantages of TYP are

2402
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:12,720
At that time, it can still be approved by the principal

2403
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:13,480
Education Bureau agrees

2404
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:16,320
we can do a whole class survey

2405
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,880
now includes DH several years ago

2406
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,880
Did you hear they're going to do a class survey?

2407
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,560
subject to parental consent

2408
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,840
The sample of that thing is not right anytime soon

2409
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:27,560
Then it becomes what we call deviation

2410
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:28,360
Yes or no

2411
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:29,480
Is BioS biased?

2412
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:31,320
not a biased sample

2413
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:32,360
biased sample words

2414
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:34,000
It is not suitable for us to do these studies

2415
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,640
so we are lucky

2416
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:38,040
Then about education reform

2417
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:39,880
Between the new system and the inauguration

2418
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,680
The information we can provide is

2419
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:42,680
what we just said

2420
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:45,400
The new system brings more obvious

2421
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,440
social class inequality

2422
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,840
That is, I just had

2423
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:49,840
sorry i just repeat

2424
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,560
that is

2425
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:53,160
twenty five percent

2426
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:55,560
Households in the top 25 percent of income

2427
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:58,680
Chances for his children to attend star high schools

2428
01:35:58,680 --> 01:35:59,960
very significantly high

2429
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,020
So this is probably what we can think of here

2430
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:05,380
Then admit the sample before merging

2431
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:09,360
We have found that the combination of these two groups of samples probably has no major problems in other aspects

2432
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:10,940
so we just merge it

2433
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:12,860
The new curriculum must follow

2434
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:15,440
Only recently started to matter

2435
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:16,640
just we

2436
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,940
These samples are all too old to be 31 years old

2437
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,240
Hehehe

2438
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,740
but thank you for asking

2439
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:28,400
Hello Professor

2440
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,700
Thank you very much for your efforts

2441
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:31,980
i want to ask a question

2442
01:36:31,980 --> 01:36:36,840
Because I think you are very concerned about this so-called vulnerable group

2443
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:40,420
I think we have what's called affectionate disorder

2444
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:41,200
such a person

2445
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:44,260
During the whole development process, he didn't know if there was any in you

2446
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:46,060
especially to track or say

2447
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:47,080
you on this

2448
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:47,860
you

2449
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:50,160
do you have any such a plan

2450
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:54,520
Some simple assessments can be made on this scene in Taiwan

2451
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:55,280
or

2452
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:55,780
right

2453
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:58,360
Thank you for your question

2454
01:36:58,360 --> 01:36:59,640
us

2455
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Generally speaking, we take the hospital of traditional Chinese medicine to be responsible for promoting another big investigation

2456
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
From the survey of social change in Taiwan

2457
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Before I borrowed time, we all had special inquiries about the need for some disabled people in the family.

2458
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,000
That number is usually too small in the overall survey

2459
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Based on our own survey

2460
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Why did I specifically mention deviant behavior

2461
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
because that's what we can gather

2462
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
we have noticed

2463
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
I don't know if you guys really remember

2464
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
At that time, I will say that our English is called

2465
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Taiwan Youth Survey

2466
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Don't talk about Taiwan Youth Project

2467
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I said I don't want because we have no strength

2468
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
we don't have social workers

2469
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
And we don't have a counselor

2470
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
If you need psychological counseling

2471
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
what do we do when the parents call

2472
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
But everyone was young back then

2473
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Everyone says they want to

2474
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
so i remember i was serious so

2475
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Get to know some psychology of Yilan County

2476
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
sorry psychiatrist

2477
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I'll just say we know he has this problem

2478
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,300
the teacher reacted

2479
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:02,900
I asked the doctor to say

2480
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:05,300
You can go to this school to help

2481
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:08,200
Then I found out that their school is high school

2482
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,300
their referral

2483
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:14,300
The referral referral system is not like this

2484
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:16,700
Be sure to contact your tutor with them

2485
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:19,300
The hospital can't go there to take the baby away

2486
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:21,100
I also remember

2487
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:23,500
A father specifically called to say

2488
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:25,500
why don't you guys visit me this year

2489
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:26,300
how can i tell him

2490
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:27,800
Because his son is gone

2491
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:28,800
his son left

2492
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,400
if his son leaves i want him

2493
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,300
I can't help it

2494
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:33,200
I can't get in touch with his son

2495
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:36,300
At that time I felt really sad

2496
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:38,300
then we have some mothers

2497
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:39,300
also called

2498
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:41,800
Let's just say that the son is the otaku we just talked about

2499
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,300
college graduates do nothing

2500
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:44,400
He said nobody cares

2501
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,400
but the strange thing is

2502
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:46,700
tip interviewer calls

2503
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:48,300
make an appointment with him

2504
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:49,800
he said yes

2505
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,700
wow this mama washes out

2506
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:53,000
called several times and said

2507
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,200
can you please

2508
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:56,100
just please let him come to your place

2509
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:57,200
for free

2510
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,100
Just when your princess was born

2511
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,100
just let him go

2512
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Just go out and help

2513
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
you can see this happening

2514
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
few others

2515
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
we have no way

2516
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
as an adult

2517
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
there is no way to track like this

2518
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,000
So I always feel very owed

2519
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Not only research does not know more than the system

2520
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
in difficult situations

2521
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,000
We can't help enough

2522
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Really are

2523
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
So we just hope that at least

2524
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
let us know

2525
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
in deviant behavior

2526
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
They were looked down upon from childhood

2527
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
there is a problem

2528
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
In fact, he is likely to start a business in the future.

2529
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
So give humanity a little hope

2530
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
you don't know

2531
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Are there any other questions?

2532
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
good

2533
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
there are several questions here

2534
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
one two three

2535
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
from this young man

2536
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
hello professor

2537
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I just want to ask

2538
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
about teens in

2539
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
The part of bullying between the possible fellow

2540
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
for their growth

2541
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,280
Except we usually

2542
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:09,200
Regret that linear thinking may produce

2543
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:14,000
Is there anything else that was accidentally discovered in the research?

2544
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:17,880
As for my reporter's answer

2545
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:19,720
If I forget, trouble the two teachers to add

2546
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:21,760
I reporter we have had to ask

2547
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:24,920
a problem called school bullying

2548
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:26,400
we even then

2549
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,280
I still remember if Teacher Yawenshan said

2550
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:30,400
Many junior high school students join gangs

2551
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:30,880
Do you have

2552
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,680
At that time, we also followed the newspapers

2553
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:33,680
we also asked

2554
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:36,680
But too few people come out

2555
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:38,040
because you need to know

2556
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:39,880
That's not to say too little doesn't matter

2557
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:42,240
It's that we have no way to process this data

2558
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:43,840
Among your five thousand people

2559
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,000
For example we even ask

2560
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,920
Your first sex was forced

2561
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:49,520
We also asked this question

2562
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:52,160
All four thousand people came down

2563
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:53,920
forty eight

2564
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:55,480
What about forty-eight if

2565
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:58,560
You're going to do something special that's hard to do

2566
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:59,640
there is no way

2567
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
48 more than no

2568
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
or 48 than yes no

2569
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
This 48 is too small, everything is too small

2570
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,000
So I remember we had this problem

2571
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Just asking if you ever joined a gang

2572
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Actually this is

2573
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Sociology is different from journalism

2574
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
journalism for this particular

2575
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
it can write a long article

2576
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Makes you feel like everything is in danger, doesn't it?

2577
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Then we also hope to be able to fight against grass and trees

2578
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
do a little proof but

2579
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Too little data age

2580
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
So that school bully you want special sampling

2581
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
maybe more likely

2582
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Because we used to have a part-time assistant

2583
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Later, at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, those social work doctors

2584
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
He can't use TYP

2585
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
to do school bullying

2586
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Instead, special sampling is required

2587
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Probably so, right?

2588
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Hello Professor, my problem is more troublesome

2589
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
older is

2590
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Our teenagers in Taiwan now

2591
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
His ingredients may not only be

2592
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
native of taiwan

2593
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
He may also include family members like outsiders

2594
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
or planning a family

2595
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I don't know about you in that regard

2596
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Did you discover something during your process?

2597
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
The second is about education

2598
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
That's what we did when you started in 2000

2599
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:13,000
That was between 2000 and 204 to 2008

2600
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Taiwan has already begun to have so-called home education

2601
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
or non-school style education of these families

2602
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
I don't know you guys are in the process of adjusting

2603
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Has there been such a case?

2604
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
how do you deal with it

2605
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
thanks for asking the first question

2606
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
i wish someone would ask

2607
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
because we had

2608
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
we spent a month or two

2609
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Sort out mother or father

2610
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Children whose place of birth is not in Taiwan

2611
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
The result is probably out

2612
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
If I remember correctly it is more than 100

2613
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Then he is almost 60% in the mainland station

2614
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I thought it was great

2615
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
We this is the characteristic of our Zhihua sample

2616
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
so i remember we were

2617
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
A certain area in Donglu, Nanjing

2618
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
ask him to discuss

2619
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Just interview him and an assistant

2620
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
It's not easy to get a date and I'm happy

2621
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
As a result, there is no way to do it

2622
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,200
because we are too early

2623
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:03,000
his mother is indonesian

2624
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,120
He told me that I was born a few years earlier

2625
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:07,320
At that time my classmates said

2626
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:10,240
your mother is a foreigner

2627
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:12,240
He said if I was born late

2628
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:13,760
five years ten years bad

2629
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:16,560
I became a child of a foreign spouse family

2630
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:17,800
my puppet

2631
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:18,560
that way

2632
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,440
Indeed I did not consider the location

2633
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:22,640
That is to say, our entry point is the year 2000

2634
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:23,360
even said

2635
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:24,360
He was Guoyi at that time

2636
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:26,320
He didn't feel discriminated against

2637
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:27,560
On the contrary, he is very proud in class

2638
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:29,360
because mom is a foreigner

2639
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:30,360
you understand me so well

2640
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,560
So this discriminatory nature of foreign assignments

2641
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:35,480
Although the number of people who followed him

2642
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:37,280
and quality

2643
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:38,960
But it is more of a social ethos

2644
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:42,360
I always tell you a fact

2645
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:44,240
if we say

2646
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:47,320
Less educated outsiders

2647
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:48,960
The education level of the person who begs you to marry him

2648
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,680
Is it higher?

2649
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:53,520
It is who in our Taiwanese society marries whom

2650
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:54,560
so i keep saying

2651
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,600
If the expatriate family comes to Taiwan

2652
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:57,840
them

2653
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,960
Didn't come to change our family system

2654
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,620
They bring in some new cultural elements

2655
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:04,120
it is possible they are

2656
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:07,080
Cooking is different

2657
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:08,580
All aspects of diet

2658
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:12,360
However, the entire family accommodation still maintains considerable integrity.

2659
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:16,540
As for the changes you said after 2008

2660
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:20,000
Because we've moved beyond that time

2661
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,200
That is to say, this group of people are all national first or third nationals in 2000.

2662
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:27,120
Every time we recruit our assistants, we must have such a person

2663
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:29,460
we just looked at him thinking we were visiting him

2664
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:32,920
So Xuanyuan told me that he is the last Guoyi sample

2665
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:35,920
The next assistants are all smaller than this

2666
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:37,420
you can say it like this

2667
01:44:37,420 --> 01:44:40,080
So we say there's something wrong with them watching him

2668
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:42,460
sometimes ask their opinion how they feel

2669
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:43,660
The teacher is very interesting

2670
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:47,460
Then we're the last one or two

2671
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:48,460
good

2672
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:49,460
so

2673
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:51,460
hello i want to ask

2674
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:54,460
That's the one you mentioned about flagging

2675
01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:57,460
For his subsequent entrepreneurship, he still has a higher income

2676
01:44:57,460 --> 01:44:59,460
Ariel mentioned that there is a level of conservatism

2677
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,000
I would like to ask what is discussed in the degree of conservatism

2678
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Also for entrepreneurship and higher income

2679
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Do you have any ideas to explain this?

2680
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Conservative attitude

2681
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
We have a set of topics

2682
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Just ask him what he thinks about some attitudes in society

2683
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
social values

2684
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
generally speaking

2685
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Males are more conservative than females

2686
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
less conservative

2687
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
working class more conservative

2688
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
This is not a unique phenomenon in Taiwan

2689
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
the whole world is like this

2690
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
So I've been talking about generational differences before

2691
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Recently this John Toppings teacher would say

2692
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
He thinks the coming of this generation is a class difference

2693
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,000
That's not all class differences

2694
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Politicians everywhere are eager to stir up class differences too

2695
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Because the class differences are very obvious

2696
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,000
So I'm thinking that this thing is actually

2697
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,000
From the perspective of our academic research

2698
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
would not like to see such a development

2699
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Although we will master, record and analyze

2700
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Then I just said Chen Yi, Mr. Fu

2701
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,600
I feel very happy that

2702
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:04,600
This group has always had low family cohesion

2703
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:06,900
High degree from single bird family

2704
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:08,500
low support among friends

2705
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:10,700
And I'm talking about significantly lower

2706
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:13,100
This group of people until he was 31 years old

2707
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:15,900
He is more likely to have a higher income

2708
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:18,700
I think this is an inspiration to everyone

2709
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:20,400
And this is not journalism

2710
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:21,500
this is sociology

2711
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:23,500
This is statistically significant

2712
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,600
And this group of people is not so small

2713
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:27,200
Only over 9%

2714
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:29,400
don't i think it's very interesting

2715
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:30,400
so ask me why

2716
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:33,500
That is to say, maybe we are in the process of breaking the impression of the scientific version

2717
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:34,900
it may be social science

2718
01:46:34,900 --> 01:46:37,300
able to contribute to society and some

2719
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:40,200
a big element

2720
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:42,400
Mr. Zhou Wei

2721
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:47,800
My surname is Fang

2722
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:51,200
I am retired from the Institute of Marine Biology, Sun Yat-sen University

2723
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:55,000
I remember personal academic orientation

2724
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,800
It is also closely related to statistics

2725
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,200
we do a lot

2726
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,500
Statistical work on this reliquary

2727
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:08,000
Then I congratulate you on this very massive one

2728
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:13,000
A trial protocol and study

2729
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:17,500
What I'm going to say next are some of my thoughts

2730
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:23,000
Don't dare say it's dialectical or questioning

2731
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Because although we are all statistics

2732
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:34,000
But I think there are a lot of shocks that are new to me

2733
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:39,000
First of all, the sampling of our relic statistics is

2734
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,500
There is a stricter specification

2735
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:47,500
But I see that your database is very large

2736
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:50,000
thousands of individual cases

2737
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:56,000
And there's about 20 years of

2738
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
There is no way for us to do such a research

2739
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Then I just express a little bit of my feelings

2740
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
That's because I don't know much about directness research.

2741
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,000
We compare by measurement, by data

2742
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,000
use the tight one

2743
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Some tests such as variable anti-review

2744
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:24,000
So I may have some misunderstandings and I'm not sure

2745
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Then my first feeling is

2746
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
because you were doing this 20 years ago

2747
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,000
A sample like this

2748
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:39,000
When you are going to ask questions and send out questionnaires

2749
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
but i guess

2750
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
the tests you did later

2751
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:50,000
In fact, it did not take into account when sampling

2752
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
you need to answer so many questions

2753
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,000
That is to say, the question you asked later was

2754
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,000
When the questionnaire was unloaded

2755
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,280
you actually didn't expect

2756
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:06,560
It was only later from such a large Database

2757
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:09,900
you generate some motivation

2758
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:11,840
did some tests

2759
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:14,440
So here's what we're talking about

2760
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:17,100
just might be

2761
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:21,800
Do you measure first and ask for proof

2762
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:25,520
And then finally some Ni said from it

2763
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,040
Then come to tests

2764
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:30,880
This is the same as when we were doing ecology in the wild

2765
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:33,720
is kind of the opposite

2766
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:37,720
Because you mentioned that Ni said it would

2767
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:40,160
would in fact be more or less

2768
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:43,360
Affect your original experimental design

2769
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:46,920
Include some that are not randomly sampled

2770
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:49,800
or something like that

2771
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:51,640
Then I look at the parsed stuff

2772
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:54,680
also analyzed many

2773
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:56,920
this different ni said

2774
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:59,440
Of course your team is very big

2775
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:00,080
so there are many

2776
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
many people doing their own thing

2777
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,280
So this database cannot be a single database

2778
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:10,680
So every member of every team

2779
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:12,920
when he did this test

2780
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:16,840
He screens the data he needs in it

2781
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:19,400
So these data and another team

2782
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:23,960
In fact, the data made will have some differences

2783
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:26,640
So it is impossible to have the same database

2784
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:29,240
do all these quizzes you say

2785
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:30,960
because if that's the case

2786
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:33,280
If you have to answer so many questions

2787
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:38,480
We're statistically just going to have less degrees of freedom

2788
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:40,880
because you have to answer a lot of questions

2789
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:43,880
Every time you ask a question, your degree of freedom will be reduced.

2790
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:47,160
So even if you have such a large database

2791
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:53,960
I feel a little lack of freedom

2792
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:56,600
Another problem is

2793
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:00,360
I've been trying to guess what statistics you use

2794
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,000
I always thought it was because I didn’t understand a lot in the study of direct belief.

2795
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
So it's probably doing direct research to do the test

2796
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
But then I made a guess

2797
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:16,000
You are probably using a method of the so-called maximum likelihood

2798
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
That's because your data are all frequency

2799
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:24,000
So you are doing a test with the highest probability

2800
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
What about this?

2801
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,000
I understand a little bit

2802
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Because there is something in it including logistic test and so on

2803
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:42,000
As for some tests, we usually have an f test

2804
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:47,000
a two-tailed test

2805
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,000
But I saw some results from your test

2806
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Significant or not

2807
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
but there are positive and negative

2808
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Then this is a challenge for me

2809
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
I never thought of something like edge analysis

2810
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
F test in analysis method

2811
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:05,800
Another conclusion can be drawn from the government

2812
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:09,700
This is why I want to go back and go well

2813
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:14,600
to think for yourself and to learn something

2814
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,900
Another thing is

2815
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:21,900
I'm a little confused

2816
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:25,100
Usually we do a test

2817
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:29,700
We all assume that my sampling space is

2818
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:30,900
is stable

2819
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:32,000
is constant

2820
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
but the one on your side

2821
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:37,700
20 years before and after the change

2822
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:39,700
Of course you have some test

2823
01:52:39,700 --> 01:52:42,100
very very very correct

2824
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:46,500
Because I want to compare what's 20 years ago with what's 20 years from now

2825
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:48,800
but some are

2826
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:52,200
It seems inevitable that the

2827
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:56,900
Assume that during the 20-year period of your study

2828
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:59,800
Society as a whole hasn't changed much

2829
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,560
Or is he actually stable

2830
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:06,660
Or maybe he wasn't disturbed too much

2831
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:08,700
but i personally think

2832
01:53:09,220 --> 01:53:13,820
Even especially in sociology

2833
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:18,420
Our society has not been stable in the past 20 years

2834
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:22,020
So many factors outside of me

2835
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:24,580
including gender relations including

2836
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:29,960
some of the things we talk about have actually changed a lot in 20 years

2837
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,280
Actually changing factors

2838
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:34,860
These samples are not self-generated

2839
01:53:35,380 --> 01:53:36,900
but external

2840
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:38,960
External impact exists

2841
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:41,780
This is all my doubts

2842
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,080
you don't need to answer thanks

2843
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:47,920
This is the last question for us because the Secretariat still has some

2844
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:50,480
something to announce

2845
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:54,320
thanks for this

2846
01:53:54,580 --> 01:53:58,160
Professor Fang was the senior of my National Taiwan University choir, he was our Tanner

2847
01:53:58,160 --> 01:53:59,440
A great Tanner

2848
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,600
You're doing marine research now quite differently than the social sciences

2849
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:06,400
But let me put it simply

2850
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:11,000
Just now Professor Fang specifically mentioned that we are researching on the content of the problem

2851
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:15,880
Is it a lot of spur-of-the-moment inspiration?

2852
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:18,940
I think my answer should say three out of four no

2853
01:54:18,940 --> 01:54:21,500
because every time we have a research framework that comes up

2854
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:23,300
where to get the topic

2855
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:26,360
But you saw me just now I don't look back

2856
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:28,420
We have some ongoing issues

2857
01:54:28,420 --> 01:54:30,720
Also write some new topics

2858
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:34,320
In other words, even if it is a discipline group

2859
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:38,400
After we entered university from high school in another country, we changed it a little bit.

2860
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,460
Then we will change it a little after he admits it

2861
01:54:40,460 --> 01:54:42,760
Because maybe your parents are not around and will keep asking you

2862
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:46,600
Who are you hanging out with? I just hope you come home earlier or pay attention to your diet

2863
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:51,200
We will indeed change the persistent and new questions like these

2864
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:52,740
The other one is right

2865
01:54:52,740 --> 01:54:54,780
between the authors for each topic

2866
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:56,060
his request is different

2867
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:59,800
So he often takes samples, he only makes samples from one country and follows them all the way to the end

2868
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,540
If it is the sum of one country and three countries

2869
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:03,600
some say one of the parents

2870
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:05,160
If it's dead, I don't want it

2871
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:06,800
because with your title

2872
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:08,440
that denominator you made

2873
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:11,040
What you see N will be different

2874
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:14,040
Well, in recent years, we hope that everyone will use the same

2875
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:15,680
For example just

2876
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:18,400
Constructive disguises like that education

2877
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:21,160
General Universities Top Universities Private Universities

2878
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:23,600
we can all use the same topic

2879
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:25,840
Like recently, some reporters seem to visit

2880
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,600
Our Professor George made this

2881
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:30,200
depression

2882
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:31,800
Some research on the sense of rating

2883
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:34,720
You will find that everyone uses some of the same topics

2884
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:35,720
what about the end

2885
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:40,160
In terms of statistics, we have a publication outside

2886
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:42,840
Actually, I was just joking with Deputy Huang

2887
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:44,800
in our group

2888
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:46,000
probably except me

2889
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,800
Each teaches social statistics

2890
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:49,720
So they all know how to use

2891
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:51,120
are very complicated

2892
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:53,480
Then I often have to work very hard to follow

2893
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:56,000
I want to say why this topic uses this method

2894
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,600
Use this method for that topic

2895
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:58,760
what's the point

2896
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:00,040
things like cohabitation

2897
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,340
Teacher Yang Wenshan came to my office twice to tell me

2898
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:05,640
I have to listen for a long time to understand

2899
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:08,200
Because they all have their own algorithm

2900
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:10,760
But he's right, isn't the statistic?

2901
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:12,040
we may be with biological

2902
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:13,560
I heard the creature's leather card is very powerful

2903
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:15,880
He ordered everyone to do the same thing

2904
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:17,400
we have never heard of this

2905
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:18,940
the other one is

2906
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:22,280
20 years of change in this social context

2907
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:25,600
often to inspire us to add some questions

2908
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:30,460
For example, when someone asked about the economic bubble in 2008 and 2009

2909
01:56:30,460 --> 01:56:32,000
we specifically asked

2910
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,040
family financial instability

2911
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:38,660
We have a set of questions that ask you if the following things happened to you last year

2912
01:56:38,660 --> 01:56:39,940
Does anyone remember will ask

2913
01:56:39,940 --> 01:56:44,280
These include the father's cause, the mother's cause, or one of the parents

2914
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:45,820
death or divorce etc.

2915
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:48,640
I hope to be able to capture this

2916
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:50,440
special circumstances

2917
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:51,200
but of course

2918
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:53,760
Because after this whole topic goes down,

2919
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:55,760
you can't move around

2920
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:59,080
Even now we sometimes say how to write like this at that time

2921
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:00,080
Can't write Chinese well enough

2922
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,200
you can't change

2923
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:02,880
because you already use people like this

2924
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:04,720
have to keep using it continuously

2925
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:06,320
So I thank Professor Fang

2926
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,160
Remind us something we really still

2927
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:10,880
I hope that in the future, when others do research,

2928
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:12,560
there may be a place to work hard

2929
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:13,360
Thanks

2930
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:14,800
ok ask again

2931
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:15,840
secretary group

2932
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:18,480
what are you announcing

2933
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:20,480
thank you before we do this

2934
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:22,240
Professor Ying's wonderful speech

2935
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:24,000
applause

2936
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:30,640
Secretariat report

2937
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:33,520
Today's speech is by Mr. Yi Xinchun before his retirement

2938
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:36,080
The last big Chinese speech

2939
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:38,160
Colleague Xu Weisuo in order to thank the teacher

2940
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:39,680
dedication over the years

2941
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:41,440
Make special use of tonight's occasion

2942
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:42,720
Thanks Teacher Yi

2943
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:44,960
We also wish Mr. Yi's retirement life

2944
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:46,560
Still rich and brilliant

2945
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:47,600
Thanks

2946
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,240
Then you can get a small gift

2947
01:59:02,240 --> 01:59:03,740
Thank you for your participation today
